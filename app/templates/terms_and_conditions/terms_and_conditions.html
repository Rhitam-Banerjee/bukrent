            Bukrent proposes a reasonable reading period with a restriction on the number of books that a member can hold at any point in time. No penalty will be levied for delayed return of books. However, under specific circumstances where other library members have requested for and are waiting for a book/s for more than 10 days, Bukrent reserves the right to contact and request members holding book/s to be returned. Members are requested to then return the requested book/s within five (5) days of such request. Reading fees should be paid as per the plan. In the event a member does not renew his/her subscription the company reserves the right to adjust the deposit amount towards the reading fees. If there is no balance in the Deposit Amount, then the company will terminate the membership of the member. All correspondence in this regard will be communicated to the email address of the member as submitted in the application form. Members are requested to update their contact details periodically when changed. Reading fee paid in advance will not be refunded.

            At Bukrent, we take utmost care to maintain books in good condition. Any anomaly (unprinted pages) of damage if found should be reported either at the front desk while getting the book issued or to the delivery executive if the book is delivered at the door. Failure to check and/or report the same will be constituted as if the member has received a book in good condition. While returning the book, The front desk executive or the deliver executive (if the book is collected at the door) will check for any damage of book(s) and report to the member accordingly. The determination of a book being “damaged” will be at the sole discretion of Bukrent. Members can choose to replace a lost or damaged book within 10 days or pay the penalty amount determined by Bukrent. The damage policy is detailed below.

        <div class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            To discourage ad-hoc and short term membership, members are required to comply with a minimum membership term of three months. For members who subscribe to plans with a refundable deposit, any premature closure of membership in less than three months from the date of sign-up, will result in the reading fee for the remaining period of the mandatory term getting adjusted against the deposit. The rest of the deposit, however will be refunded. For members who subscribe to annual plans without deposit there is no refund applicable at the time of closure. Under extreme situations caused by non-compliance to the Terms of Use by member, Bukrent reserves the right to terminate a membership for any or no reason without any refund.

        <div class="col-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            Upon expiry of membership, Bukrent sends reminders over emails/sms to its members for renewal. Three months after expiry, Bukrent reserves the right to classify the account as ‘Dormant’ and initiate steps to recover cost of books and any unpaid reading fee from the refundable deposit, if there is no action on the reminders, which would be communicated to the member through email/sms. Post this recovery, any excess deposit left in the account will be retained as “Unclaimed” refundable deposit for a period of 3 months and periodic reminders would be sent to the member to claim the same. After 12 months of expiry of membership, Bukrent reserves the right to treat the member as “not reachable” and take appropriate action on the unclaimed refundable deposit if there has been no response from the member on the reminder communications.

            Since the reading fee is a flat rate and is not linked to the number of books read in a period, it is important to note that each title catalogued in Bukrent gets the same treatments irrespective of size, cost & target reader. Children’s books are treated the same way as other books..

            Through a feature called “Subscription Holiday”, Bukrent allows the member to pause the membership (temporary suspension), for a duration of 1 month, 2 months or 3 months before expiration of membership.
