9781409308614,"I got this peppa pig sticker book for my 2 years old daughter who loves to watch peppa pig show. This activity book is cute with stickers and all colored pages but there are 3 cutting activity pages that's just on the other side of different activity page. If you cut the page, other activity pages get cut. They should've put blank page for cutting activity pages. All the activity contents seem to be pretty boring, to me. My daughter hasn't seen this book yet so maybe it's fun for toddler kids... On the other hand, the book was delivered in 7 days which I expected longer than that.

9781405220989,"Tintin is a milestone in the European comics and in children litterature as well, just like Jules Verne was in his time. But don't get it wrong: the great cycle of Tintin's adventures starts with The Blue Lotus (you'll want to read The Pharaoh's Cigars in order to get the beginning of the story), in which book Herg, thanks to his Chinese friend (in real life) Chang Chong-Zhen, wrote and draw the kind of realistic yet humoristic story that would make the real grandeur of Tintin. For those who read french or dutch (hoping an english translation will be published one day), I really advise to read ""Herg: Son of Tintin"" by Benoit Peeters.",a Book Depository customer

9781444011678,"The returning heroes As a child I used to love going to the library and reading all the Asterix books they had, he was my favourite better than Tintin and with his friend Obelix they were my heroes as they always beat up the invading Romans. Oh how I have missed you my old friend, but not anymore! With a new writing team, Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad and they have continued in the tradition of Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. This time, Asterix and Obelix are off to Scotland to fight the Romans and collaborating Picts against the other clans. When a Pict is washed up outside their village all the women fall in love with him and the men folk cannot wait to send him back. Asterix and Obelix take him back to his clan in Scotland so he can find his love and marry her. Along the way there are all the old puns, the old wit and plenty of humour of the slapstick variety. There is plenty of fighting and then Obelix finds his joy at the end when he can fight Romans. This book is an excellent reminder as to why I originally loved the whole Asterix series and it is great to see the book back. For us of an older generation it is a return to form and we should be encouraging people to read this once again. I cannot recommend this fun book highly enough go and buy it for the kids, schools get it on your shelves today!",Paul D
9788434568280,"Buyer beware - if you are looking for the usual type of Asterix book, this is not it. It looks like a ""book of the film"" edition, with a few big pictures per page and lots of prose. Just so you know.",Jean Anderson
9781613772355,"Some of the most fun, exciting and well thought out sci-fi comics you'll ever read about the crew of a spaceship on a cruade...who just happen to be giant transforming robots. There's mysteries and action galore, but what's amazing about this stories are the character insights and how (some of) the characters develop - tailgate, swerve, cyclonus, chrome dome, even ultra magnus and yes, later on, glimmers of whirl. It's a big cast but they are so well written they each have a distinct personality that goes beyond 'red car robot, blue helicopter robot'.",Andrew Irwin
9781613772355,"Although I huge fan of Transformers since I was a kid, this series has disappointed me. I didn't even last to the third volume. Boring to death. Too bad..",Constantine Fountos
9781613775554,"Reason for Reading: I used to love the Transformers comics and cartoon plus I loved the first movie. I was never a serious reader of comic books so not hooked on storylines but did pick up various issues here and there and loved reading them. This volume is a continuation of the original series which ended in 1991, I believe. It is 21 years later and the story picks up where it left off with what has been going on in the meantime and what the crisis is now. Loose ends from issue 80 are tied up and the first issue here is numbered 81. It helps if you have read the old comics as many references are made to past events with asterisks referring you to specific issues anywhere from 1-80, though mostly #'s 75-80. As a ""guy on the street"" fan of the Transformers I loved the story, and while not all that familiar with the history knew enough of Transformer lore to understand what was going on. Fans will be thrilled with the return of many familiar faces from the past and of course, we are not disappointed with the ultimate Optimus Prime vs Megatron battle at the end and the writer's don't go easy on our hearts either with a couple of deaths which seem to come far too soon in a story just started. Seems like a series that will be great fun for fans old and new. Quite appropriate for all ages as well who can handle the robot violence. Fun.",Nicola Mansfield
9780141324906,"I couldn't see why this was in YA/Teen section in the library, cuz I'd rather call this a Children's book. It was funny though... Jeff is a good cartoonist, that made this funny at some points. This is a perfect children's book, I would bet that my little brother would love it. I felt that it got a bit too silly with the nicknames... I don't recommend it to YA readers, but It's an easy read if you just want something to read while you're at a holiday or something. There aren't any chapters in this book but it's divided into months and monday-sunday, just like a diary... It has really awesome drawings and it's really quick page turner... I didn't feel captivated with any of the characters. The story didn't have any remarkable ending either...",Sindre Ellingsen
9780141324906,"The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is one of the funniest children's book series ever. The book itself is very well designed, with the front cover actually looking like a diary (The first line of the book: ""Let me get something straight: this is a JOURNAL, not a diary.). The cartoons on the inside of the book are also very well drawn, with the pages being lined, just like in a journal. This is the first book in a quite long series by Jeff Kinney. The story is about Greg, a self-centred boy who thinks he's going to be famous, and his day-to-day adventures.

This one, I'm sure you're delighted to hear, is as good as the first. It follows the same format (looks like a diary, lined pages), but it's missing something......zing. The first one was incredibly funny, but this one just feels like an expansion to the first. It just doesn't feel like it's own book, if you catch my drift. On the bright side it does come with a very nice Loded Diper sticker. I really like this book but it just feels a bit...repetitive.",ReviewerOfReviews

9781419705847,"Oh, dear! Another ""Wimpy Kid"" book. Will they ever end, or will we follow Greg Heffley all the way to the nursing home? I actually asked the publisher not to send me any more of these books because I really don't like them, but I am a book reviewer, so they send them anyway. I realize that they are immensely popular with many children and that some critics have praised them to the highest heavens as being truly in tune with the problems and angst of the modern middle school student. This may be part of the reason why they simply don't appeal to me whatever. I was in ""middle school"" (we called it upper elementary and junior high then) back in the 1960s, so the events and feelings of Greg are very far removed from my own experiences. Furthermore, the things described in the book are exactly the kinds of negative public-school related experiences from which Christian parents who homeschool wish to shelter their children. In The Third Wheel, Greg, who I believe is just in either seventh or eighth grade now, is really concerned about not having a girlfriend, especially with the upcoming Valentine's Day Dance. This may seem strange to a lot of folks, but at one time nearly all religious people opposed mixed dancing, and there are still a few of us around today. These kids are but twelve or thirteen, yet there is a lot of talk about getting a date and how to go about it. This is only middle school, yet Greg says, ""It's hard to keep track of who has gone out with who in my school,"" one boy boasts ""that he's kissed a bunch of different girls in my grade,"" and one couple has ""been going out...since the fifth grade."" Whatever happened to protecting the innocence and purity of children rather than pushing them into sexualized situations at earlier and earlier ages? I guess that this is what disturbs me most about these Wimpy Kid books, especially since they're marketed to children as young as eight. In addition to the dancing and the dating, there are references to other such wonderfully educational experiences in school that leave such pleasant memories as kids having toilet paper fights, people making obnoxious noises at a fellow named Bryan Buttsey, and guys getting ""pantsed."" Also, Greg's Uncle Gary has been married four times, spends what money he has on scratch lottery tickets at the convenience store, and is addicted to a virtual-world computer game-a really great role model! Thankfully, the language is not too bad, with only a couple of common euphemisms (heck, dang it), although Greg does use the expression, ""God knows what else."" There may actually be some real humor somewhere in the story, but it's completely lost on me. Admittedly, young people could be reading worse, but they could certainly read a lot better. So far as I can tell, there is simply nothing in the Wimpy Kid books that would be of any interest to godly people.",Wayne S. Walker
9781419706424,"First there was the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, said to be a realistic fiction novel, by Jeff Kinney, which appeared on FunBrain.com in 2004 and was released in hardcover on April 1, 2007. Next, there have been several sequels, including Rodrick Rules (2008), The Last Straw (2009), Dog Days (2009), The Ugly Truth (2010), the only one that I have read, and Cabin Fever (2011). The seventh, The Third Wheel, is scheduled for release on November 13, 2012. Then there was a Diary of a Wimpy Kid film that was released by 20th Century Fox on March 19, 2010. After that, there were two more movies, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, based on book two of the Wimpy Kid series in 2011, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days based on books three and four in 2012. Now, there is a tie-in book, written by Kinney, called The Wimpy Kid Movie Diary. It was originally published in 2010 and included film stills, script pages, storyboards, preliminary concept drawings, some new illustrations, and also behind the scenes information to chronicle in a humorous way the making of the film. The latest edition gives the story of all three movies. It begins with some background information about the original book, explains how it was made into a film, and then tells about the two movie sequels. Though the books, which chronicle in diary form how Greg Heffley relates to his dad Frank Heffley, his mom Susan Heffley, his older brother Rodrick, his little brother Manny, his best friend Rowley Jefferson, other kids at school, and people in the neighborhood, have been highly praised and very popular, I must be honest and say that they do not hit my hot button at all. However, those who do like the Wimpy Kids books and movies will undoubtedly enjoy this companion to the series and find it interesting.",Wayne S. Walker

I was so excited to read this one, but i might have been a bit disappointed. First of all, all of the series is a fun-fast read. They are all really funny, and even Juhina, yes Juhina, my 21 year old sister, loves them too. I felt like this book wasn't as funny as the first five. I just felt like it lacked the Greg spark, that always seemed to make the book hilarious. I guess there wasn't much funny interactions with his mom and dad and lil brother manny, which i loved reading about. There isn't much to write about this book, since half of the book is pictures. So i really hope the next book will be funnier than this one.",Juhina & Farah

9780810983915,"Greg Heffley wants to spend his summer indoors, relaxing, playing video games with his friend, Rowley, and watching late-night horror films. His mom has other ideas, however. She wants him to spend time with the family, improving his education, and playing outdoors. Greg tries to implement his ideas of summer, but without much success. He tries to spend time with Rowley kicking back at his friend's father's country club, but gets permanently uninvited when he accidentally tells the clubhouse manager his complaints about the place's service. Things only get worse when his mom tells him he has to find a way to pay off half of the smoothie bill he and Rowley racked up. When Greg's father comes home with a dog that won't leave him alone, he's soon at his wits end. With failed attempts to earn money, a falling out with his best friend, and a crazy dog, will Greg ever survive summer? Will he find some way to make this into a great summer, despite the rocky start? This fourth installment is an excellent addition to the other three stories. Greg's true character really comes out in this novel as he discovers who he is, learns to balance everything that's going on, and takes an easy-going approach to life. The illustrations are well-done and only add to the book's humor. Avid and reluctant readers alike who have loved the other DIARY OF A WIMPY KID books, who like humorous stories, or who prefer reading realistic fiction will all enjoy this one.",TeensReadToo

Greg reveals all the embarrassing encounters involving his mother's determination to butt into his life. He also includes tales of his bumpy relationship with his best friend, Rowley. Imaginative cartoon drawings combined with fresh, wacky humor make the DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES popular with even the most sophisticated readers in my middle school.

9780810993136,"If you work with middle grade kids, be sure to check out DIARY OF A WIMPY KID. Greg Heffley is a 6th-grade weakling trying to make his mark in the middle school world. His family includes a mom, a dad, a heavy metal big brother, and a whiny, tattling little brother. His best friend is Rowley, another odd 6th-grader with overprotective parents and the world-class ability to annoy. Greg is always a victim of the big, mean bullies in the school. He constantly seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. In an attempt to be ""cool"" he experiments with the idea of weightlifting, creating his own haunted house, running for class treasurer, and building a snowman big enough to be considered for the Guiness Book of World Records. However, the only mild success he accomplishes is as a safety guard whose job is to walk the kindergarten kids home at lunchtime. At least with that job he gets free hot chocolate and misses twenty minutes of math class. Readers will be able to relate to Greg's typical teenage problems. His parents ground him from his video games, his older brother picks on him, his little brother gets him in trouble, and the girls in his school think he is a waste of their time. He'd like to pretend he's just a mediocre student when he is really one of the ""uncool"" gifted kids. The odds are just stacked against him. Kinney bills his books as ""a novel in cartoons,"" which is sure to be a popular feature with middle grade readers, especially those of the reluctant variety. The clever illustrations were a fantastic way to play up the already great humor in the book. Once again, if you have anything at all to do with middle graders, get this book in their hands ASAP.",TeensReadToo

As we once again join the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, they are sent by their banker, the ever-tussive Mr Poe, to the village of V.F.D under a government scheme based on the aphorism that it takes a whole village to raise a child. Having already suffered the loss of their parents, the threat of marriage, slave labour, hypnosis, a terrible boarding school, being thrown down a lift shaft and the murder of their Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine at the hands of the evil Count Olaf and his nefarious assistants, the siblings are ever-vigilant of his reappearance.

But they soon fall foul of the many village rules : Detective Dupin throws them into jail and threatens them with burning at the stake. And just who is Jaques Snicket and what was the message about the Baudelaire parents he was prevented from giving them before his murder? Of course Count Olaf and his girlfriend, Esme Squalor are up to their usual tricks.

Esme is a rather forceful woman who is a dedicated follower of fashion, while Jerome never likes to argue, with anyone.

There is a slight mixing up of the usual format which I missed but it is all there just slightly out of order. Thankfully, a comic book starts off with a brief four pages that summarizes books 1-9, then the first chapter spends a couple of pages reminding us where we are after book ten. Book 11 is just as fantastically hyperspeed as the last one, time-travel back and forth, speeding here, speeding there and then the ultimate problem arises when the time traveling results in double sets of our heroes. Yesterday George and Yesterday Harold are living in the same time as the present ones and by book's end all four Harold and George's are in big trouble with the only consolation the announcement of book 12.

I was not entirely impressed, I'm sorry to say. Neither I nor my children (up to 21 yo) have ever read a Dave Pilkey book and there has been a reason for that. I admit I do have certain la-di-da standards when it comes to what books I allow to pass through my children's hands and yes, you could call me a ""book snob"" in that sense. One of the things that has always irritated me to no end is when parents, teachers, librarians, etc. will say about a child who consistently reads books with little to no literary merit is ""At least they're reading!"". My response to that has always been: You don't hand a child who won't eat his vegetables a box of cookies and say ""At least they're eating!"". It's the same thing, to me. But I have to admit, publicly, here and now, that I WAS WRONG about Dave Pilkey! At first glance through this book, I cringed at the purposeful spelling and grammar errors. I thought the story was silly (stupid, even) but then told myself the book is for 10yo boys not *ahem*yo mothers; the boys would love it. Wait a minute, *I* have a 10yo boy! Then I began to actually read the text and realized my 10 yo son would be able to read a good portion of this book. My son is autistic with several learning disabilities and at this point is reading easy readers. Here was a book, a thick book, with chapters, that was aimed at his age group that might actually excite him about reading. So I gave him the book, and while he did need a lot of help, he *could* read much of the book and LOVED the story. Every morning when we started our routine, he would say ""I can't wait to read my book!"" You don't know what music that was to this readaholic mum's ears! I usually give him a break from reading from his reader on Fridays, as he reads a story from an easy reader Bible that day but he was so upset to find ""Ook and Gluk"" missing that first Friday that he stormed off to get the book and happily read twice on Fridays from then on, without even thinking it was a chore! My son absolutely loved this book! Thought it was hilarious, loved the ""flip-o-rama"" pages and it is probably his favourite book *ever* right now. He was thrilled to see the page that said another Ook and Gluk book would be coming soon. Myself, I have to admit, it was funny and silly. I did laugh. The spelling and grammar errors were irksome but I got used to it and realize they made the book easier to read. My son was able to read some of the big words because they were misspelled, which gave him reading confidence. I don't intend to feed him a daily diet of Dave Pilkey but Dave is now welcome in our home and I intend to have him read the first graphic novel about the Diaper Baby in the not too distant future. Then I will finally go have a look at those darn Captain Underpants books! and check out the reading level. Thanks to OOk and Gluk, a mum learned a lesson and a boy found a book he was passionate to read.",Nicola Mansfield

9780141332598,"Egypt is one of the oldest literary cultures on earth, dating from 3200 B.C. when Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt. The tales in this book are divided into three sections. ""Tales of the Gods"" tell myths about ancient Egyptian deities such as Amen-Ra, Isis, Osiris, Thoth, Horus, Khnemu, and others. ""Tales of Magic"" relate legends about semi-historical figures in ancient Egypt like Seneferu, Khufu, Rameses the Great, and Bata. And ""Tales of Adventure"" contain other stories that the ancient Egyptians recorded. These tales are taken from the hieroglyphics carved on temples and tombs and the later papyri written after Demotic script superseded the old hieroglyphs. There are a few references to drinking wine and beer, but there is also a mention of Joseph and the Israelites in the prologue implying that the author considered them genuine historical entities. A time chart of Egyptian history places the different tales into their historical context, and there are several pages of facts about ancient Egyptian culture and beliefs. The book would make an excellent complement to a homeschool study of ancient Egypt. Roger Gilbert Lancelyn Green (1918-1987), born in Norwich, England, was a British biographer, children's writer, and Oxford academic who formed part of the Inklings literary discussion group along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. He had studied under Lewis at Merton College, Oxford, and remained close to Lewis until the latter's death in 1963. In fact, when Lewis started writing his famous children's fantasy books in the late 1940s, it was Green who encouraged him to publish it and suggested that they should be called The Chronicles of Narnia. Green became known primarily for his writings for children, particularly his retellings of the myths of Greece in Tales of the Greek Heroes (1958), The Tale of Troy (1958), and Tales the Muses Told: Ancient Greek Myths (1965); and The Tale of Thebes (1977); Norse mythology in The Saga of Asgard, later renamed Myths of the Norsemen (1960); the Arthurian legends in King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table (1953); the stories of Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1956); and even Tales from Shakespeare (1965). His works of original fiction include The Luck of Troy (1961), set during the Trojan War, and The Land of the Lord High Tiger (1958), a fantasy that has been compared to the Narnia books. There are some in the homeschool movement who have strong objections to reading and studying mythology, claiming that it gives credence to heathen idolatry. While I respect their sincere convictions, I do not necessarily agree with their conclusions. The fact that many ancient cultures worshipped false gods and the stories that they told about those false gods are part of the history of our world, and there are many aspects of our Western culture which are drawn from them. I am convinced that we can read and study about the pagan idol gods from a purely historical standpoint without honoring them in any way or being in danger of believing in them, and can even see from learning about them how much superior the one true God who is revealed to us in the Bible truly is. I did not find Green's Tales of Ancient Egypt to be awesome or inspiring, but I thought that they were interesting reading, and they do remind me how thankful I am that our universe is ruled over by a holy, just, reasonable, and orderly Lord rather than the hodge-podge of mystical, magical, mythical deities of ancient Egypt.",Wayne S.

9780141332482,"When I was a wee little thing I happened to come across the 1994 animated film adaptation of this believed children's classic and fell in love with it. It wasn't until recently (this year) that I realized that it was based on a classic piece of children's literature so when I found out I did some investigating and downloaded the kobo e-book version onto my BlackBerry and before I knew it I was reading it every chance I got. Right away though I noticed that there were of course some key differences. Since the movie I watched was a 1994 film there were some changes made to the story line. It was made to be more accessible to the modern audience but for what it was I enjoyed the book version as well. The story was a fun one and normally I'm not one for the classics but this was a good one. It was enjoyable though I sometimes felt that the story lacked the flow of a more modern novel but that is in part due to the audience it was written for back in 1872. For me, while my tastes are lean towards the more modern I did enjoy the book. I though Irene was a cute character. Her curiosity while it almost lead to her ruin was adorable to see play out on the pages, though I didn't like the demeaning way she treated Curdie the local boy who saved hers and her nursemaid's skin one night. Then again she was a princess and a very young one at that so I suppose I could excuse her attitude. Curdie though had to be my favourite character because of how smart, self reliant and courageous manner. He was the main character for me because much of the book centered around his activities in finding the goblins, and figuring out their master plan. The writing wasgood, it intrigued me but as I stated before the flow put me off a bit. I think that it was a lovely little children's classic and it deserves a spot on every kid's bookshelf because their a princess for the girls to admire and a hero for the boys. Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone young and old. This would be a good book for a night time read aloud book for kids or to be read by teachers to their classes. I'm a strong believer that though a book is older it should not lose its place on out bookshelves. I plan on reading the sequel to this book in 2013.",Kimberly Roy

Seeing the good things of life is an easy forgotten art, despite how simple it may be. This is especially something that happens a lot in today's society. That is why Pollyanna, while being an classic, is the perfect book to read for young and old. Pollyanna is an optimistic girl who plays the 'glad game'. Which is simply just a game of finding stuff to be glad about in every day life. The harder it is to find something, the gladder it'll make you. I found myself to be highly entertained by the effects of Pollyanna teaching people the glad game. It even made me appreciate the small things in life more.

9780140367218,"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea is a magnificent novel written by Jules Verne. It is a book of extraordinary creativity and fun that invites you to a world of words that will absorb you to the book forever. It makes a really good literature unit to combine with oceanography, marine biology, seamanship, the science fiction genre, etc. The book starts at the date of 1866, when an inexplicable and mysterious phenomenon creates a major stir for the world. Because of all this tumult, the Abraham Lincoln planned to go off in search of this phenomenon that is causing arguments and harms to voyages of ships that glides along the seas. Professor Pierre Aronnax, quite a noted figure, is invited to go with his faithful assistant Conseil. Also a Canadian master harpoonist Ned Land went on board. Professor Aronnax appears to be a very calm and prudent character. His leadership is shown and his high learning experiences and passion for seas and creatures result as an ardent figure that is fascinated by everything of the Nautilus. He becomes quite satisfied by this unexpected voyage of 10 months and finds every novel feature he comes upon intriguing. On the other hand, Ned Land is an obstinate character, who wishes everyday to fly out of this 'imprisonment,' which he refers the Nautilus as. Ned Land appeared as a character of somewhat staunch in his beliefs and aims. Conseil is faithful as ever to professor Aronnax, following him whenever or whatever. The incredible, extraordinary voyage and life-turning voyage for the three characters mentioned above in hunt for the detrimental phenomenon almost ends with nothing. But, one day the Abraham Lincoln confronts the Nautilus. However, this robust phenomenon turns out to be a submarine owned by Captain Nemo. The situation of turmoil around everyone when the two ships go against each other leads the professor, Conseil and Ned Land to the sea unexpectedly. Whether it is unfortunate or fortunate, they are rescued by mysterious crew men from the phenomenon. They meet Captain Nemo and find that they are literally imprisoned. So they spend their days in the Nautilus which is very interesting in every feature and every capacity it is able to perform. The Professor, in particular, finds the captain and his aims, his experiences and his submarine so intriguing. The professor also discovers that the captain has abandoned his past life of the real world and that he has turned his back towards the world because of some unknown reason. Personal valuable belongings he has collected, famous arts, a library, a saloon, personal rooms for him and his companions and wholesome foods seemed quite satisfactory to him. So days of gratification and days of agreeable new discoveries, time to work on his works, his studies and his notes passed. Submarine hunts, incidents and experiments at the Torres Straits, Papuan savages, the stranding, the coral cemetery, the Suez tunnel, Santorin Island, the Cretan plunger, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the ice-bank, the South pole, the imprisonment in ice, fights with squids, and he also sustains a scene of a ship and a crew sink because of Nautilus and Captain Nemo. My personal choice of the most memorable part of the book was when the Nautilus was trapped in the ice bank. The situation was very dire and it was a situation of imminent danger. Of this particular episode, I was able to feel a sense of warmth between the three characters, Conseil, the professor and Ned Land. Because the submarine was trapped in the bank of ice, the submarine could not be able to get renew of its air. This would have leaded to death of suffocation for all crew members boarded on the Nautilus. The professor was in impending danger of death because of suffocation, however, the two faithful two companions, although in the same difficult and painful situation, was giving all the air they have to the professor. The novel mostly contains of audacious expeditions by captain Nemo but small parts like this gave a feeling of aglow atmospheres and moves of the heart. Twenty thousand leagues under the sea is wizardry of words the humans mind can offer. It is a sea of creativity and imagination. I felt compelled to read on and on. Also it was the first time I wished the book to go incessantly on. I personally thought it brings a charm to me of the seas and ocean expeditions. Finally, it offered me an inspiration to the adventurous part of my soul.",judy

Nutt's quest to find ""worth"" has more humanity and morality than any nonsense about boy wizards and blood purity.

Where I would use a scalpel, he uses a machete, and where I would use a machete, he drops a nuclear warhead. The gods are pompous, the worshippers cowed, and the priests violently closed-minded. Yet the tale is never heavy-handed, thanks to Brutha's sincerity and some deftly comical plot twists, as well as all the levity that comes from picturing an angry God trapped in the body of a tortoise.

Being the altruistic souls they are, they decide to cure him. However, they must first obtain his real name. But only Rincewind knows it! To their greatest misfortune he is on an island the location of which is unknown. Rincewind, on the other hand, is given the task to create rain otherwise a whole continent will be destroyed. But never being the hero he tries to get as far away as possible. The book is filled with loads of sarcasm, an outrageous plot and tons of fun. Despite the slight thinness of characterisation the book is extremely enjoyable and the strong plot keeps things going. This is a novel like no other and I recommend it to all fantasy lovers. You will not be disappointed.",Aleksander Shtarbev

9781423124528,"Originally published at <a href=""http://wingedreviews.com/2012/06/artemis-fowl-by-eoin-colfer/"">Winged Reviews</a>. I wish my 12-year old self had books like this when I was growing up. Or really, I wish my 12-year old self had wanted to read books like this when I was growing up. I read a lot of serialised girl fiction, like Sweet Valley and The Babysitters Club and not quite enough 'boy books'. I realised now that while I learned a lot about gossip, boys and friendship, I missed some really important lessons, like adventure, or blackmail. Artemis Fowl Junior is a well-spoken, criminal genius, who happens to be twelve. He tries to restore his family's riches through the easiest way possible-discover the fairy races' secrets, kidnap a fairy and blackmail them for gold. It's too bad he runs up against Captain Holly Short, the only female retcon officer and the entire LEPrecon unit who will not stop until they rescue one of their own! The story is told from the point of view of both Artemis and Holly (and LEPrecon). Artemis starts out quite stern, but slowly develops a concience and sympathy. He ends up feeling bad for Holly and throughout the book, you can see a little of his dry humour start to come through. Holly is feisty and determined, always having to prove that she's a good officer, but she's also smart and empassioned and I found I liked her a lot. Although they are on opposing sides, I was rooting for both, and I liked how the lines were blurred between protagonist and antagonist. I think the best thing about the book was the great supporting cast of characters. There's kick-ass Butler, Artemis'...butler, whose family the designation 'butler' actually originated from; grumpy Commander Julius Root, Holly's commanding officer; tech-genius centaur Foaly, in charge of all of fairy's impressive technology and 007-like gadgets; and my personal favourite, the irrepressable Mulch Diggums-dwarf, kleptomaniac, burp machine. The story itself and how it unfolds is really fun and there are lots of twists and turns, which keeps it interesting. The author breaks the barrier several times and the writing is witty and humourous. The action is also paced well and it kept me wanting to read more. I would've loved this book a whole lot if I was 12 and I recommend it to anyone whose inner child wants to read a good story.",Daphne (Winged Reviews)
9781423108375,"As an ardent fan of Artemis Fowl from the first book onward, I was more than just a little excited to find out that THE TIME PARADOX was in the works. The previous book in the series, THE LOST COLONY, was one of my favorites, and it opened so many doors that I wanted desperately to see explored. After reading THE TIME PARADOX over the course of a single day, my reactions are mixed, but one thing's for sure: with Artemis Fowl in the mix, there's never a dull moment. The storyline opens only a short while after the end of the previous book. Fourteen-year-old genius Artemis Fowl has been out of his home time for nearly three years as the result of the events of THE LOST COLONY, and the world has changed around him. But the presence of younger twin brothers at Fowl Manor is not nearly as surprising as the fact that Artemis has managed to retain some of the fairy magic that he stole while in the time tunnel, making himself part magical in turn. Early on in the story, the readers find out that Artemis has used this small magic to mesmerize his parents into forgetting all about his three-year disappearance, and is learning how to control it for specific purposes. So when Artemis's mother develops symptoms of several deadly illnesses overnight, Artemis's first instinct is to use his fairy magic to save her. When that fails, draining all of the magic out of Artemis, his first call is to Holly Short, reinstated Captain in the Lower Elements Police. Holly arrives and diagnoses Artemis's mother with a rare disease known as spelltropy, usually passed between magic users by the use of power. The only cure is the brain fluid of a silky sifaka lemur--a species that became extinct nearly eight years ago, thanks to the work of a younger Artemis Fowl desperate for money to fuel the search for his then-missing father. Artemis is convinced there's a simple solution to this problem: go back in time using the magic of demon warlock No. 1 and steal the lemur from his younger self before returning to his own time. Of course, with Artemis involved, nothing could ever really be that simple. Nonetheless, he and Holly both make the journey almost eight years back in time to outsmart the ten-year-old Artemis and a group of Extinctionists bent upon getting their hands on the lemur--not to mention a mysterious third player who may be manipulating everyone from behind the scenes. The storytelling is vivid, the jokes are always funny, the puns are horrendous in the best of ways. The repartee between Artemis and Holly gets better in every book. But for whatever reason, I didn't enjoy this Fowl adventure as much as I did previous ones. It seemed somehow like there was less at stake. It was an interesting ploy, since the ""villain"" Artemis faces off against for the first half of the story is himself, but a lot of the major weight of the story felt psychological. Of course, there were the requisite explosions and high-speed cross-country chases, but the focus of this book seemed to be more upon the minds of the characters involved, particularly Artemis and Holly, and their relationships to their own pasts. That's not to say the book wasn't good--it just had a different kind of depth from the others, one that I probably couldn't fully appreciate on a first reading. Some of the doors opened in THE LOST COLONY were closed rather suddenly, in my opinion, or led down passageways I hadn't thought they would explore, so that the main developments of this book were not what I thought they would be at all. But then, what would be the fun of a predictable book? If Colfer is one thing consistently as a writer, it's unpredictable, and this book is no exception.",TeensReadToo
9780141312125,"This book follows the story of Artemis Fowl, criminal mastermind, in his attempts to run the family business. The plans he comes up with to make money are ingenious and he is unbelievable at predicting the next move that will be made against him. I love Eoin Colfer's writing style in the whole Artemis Fowl Series (6 books so far). His plays-on-words are amusing - Leprechauns aren't little green-wearing Irish men; they're actually members of the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance Unit -- LEPrecon! The characters are very well-developed, but relationships definitely aren't the focus of the story. Though the synopsis and the way it is marketed appears to be targeting younger boys, I think that this book, and its sequels, could be an enjoyable read for anyone, so long as you can get past the fart jokes! Overall, I rate this book and all of its sequels at 4 stars out of 5. I recommend it to anyone looking for a light, extremely funny read.",Amy Mansell

9781423128199,"Artemis isn't right in the head. He's having a touch of OCD - talking in words of five or rearranging items on his desk. He's also feeling paranoid. Plus, he has an idea to save the world. After sending Butler off on a bogus mission, he meets the new commander, Foaly, and Holly Short to explain his latest idea in Iceland. Just before he demonstrates the new technology, a large space vehicle appears. It's one of Foaly's more brilliant designs, but now it's under someone else's control, and that someone is using it for deadly purposes. As they attempt to escape the area, Artemis is hit and undergoes a personality switch. Holly must hold everything and everyone together while trying to escape the situation and uncover the meaning behind their attack. Unfortunately, she could really use Artemis's crafty criminal skills, but for now she must deal with Orion. Can Artemis fight through the Atlantis Complex (a disease enabled by the combination of guilt and fairy magic) in time to help save the people he loves - and his mind? I love Artemis Fowl. He's such an evil genius but also a great character to root for. Right now, he's struggling with his past actions and feels tempted to turn to the good side. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but it's interesting to watch the struggle. I love the sidekicks of this book. I love the relationship between Butler and his sister and their crazy athletic ability to kick butt anytime, anywhere. I love Holly Short - she's feisty and sarcastic, always breaking the rules, and she has a good heart. I really can't wait to see what will happen next.",TeensReadToo
9780786849598,"Artemis Fowl is back (finally)! I was terrified that my favorite Irish billionaire genius teenager was gone for good because author Eoin Colfer has been publishing a variety of books in the last couple of years that had nothing to do with good old Artemis. But, fortunately, the boy genius hasn't been forgotten. He's back and more brilliant than ever in this fifth installment of the high-tech fantasy series. As THE LOST COLONY opens, Artemis is fourteen years old and experiencing the uncomfortable pangs of puberty. While that alone is enough to keep most teens busy for a few years, Artemis has to contend with his surging hormones while trying to save an entire fairy race as it teeters on the brink of extinction. But it's that kind of multitasking that has made Artemis Fowl an international sensation. THE LOST COLONY has all the elements that Fowl fans have come to expect, including a dizzying array of fairy-issue gadgets, danger whizzing past our heroes from a variety of sources, ingenious plans, and a bodyguard who is as loyal as he is lethal. This book also includes a few new characters who were, for the most part, likeable and fun. The one notable exception is a twelve-year-old French girl who could give Artemis a run for his money in the genius category. She is pretty, rich, and highly annoying. I often found myself wishing that one of the other characters would ""accidentally"" dunk her in a sewer, or shave her head, or something equally unpleasant. Is it wrong for me to have feelings of aggression toward a fictional character? No, I don't think so. And you'll understand what I mean once you read the book. Fans of the ARTEMIS FOWL series will not be disappointed in this newest adventure. There were a few problems with the story, including some hard-to-follow descriptions of how Artemis and company escape their latest predicament, and an irritating French girl (see above). Overall, though, I found this an enjoyable book with an ending that knocked me for a loop. And, as always, I was left wondering what mischief Artemis will dream up next.",TeensReadToo
9780786817085,"I didn't discover the delight that is the Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one day. So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first. It definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it even better than the first book. There are points throughout the book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that I truly enjoyed. Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him. Now that Angeline Fowl is out of her depression, thanks to some fairy magic from Captain Holly Short, she's sent Artemis back to Saint Bartelby's School for Young Gentlemen in Ireland. Artemis is having quite a large amount of fun flumoxing the school's counselor, Dr. Po, when he gets an urgent message from Butler, his bodyguard/butler/majordomo--it seems that Artemis Fowl the First is alive in Russia, being held for ransom by the Russian Mafiya. Young Artemis, of course, immediately sets out to devise a scheme to rescue his father. It's been almost two years since Artemis Senior was last heard from, and his son is most eager to bring him home. Before he can work out a devious scheme, though, he's visited by none other than Captain Short and her superior, Commander Root, and brought down to Haven City and into Police Plaza. It seems the goblin triad, the B'Wa Kell, have a human counterpart aiding in their smuggling, and Artemis the Second is, quite justly I believe, suspected of being that human. The fairies soon realize, however, that this time Artemis Fowl isn't the bad guy in this problem. But now they'd like Artemis and Butler's help in figuring out who is behind the allaince between the goblins and the Mud Men--and Artemis is quite willing to help them out, in exchange for the fairies help in rescuing his father. What follows is an action-packed story of good versus evil below ground, with deceptions, backstabbing, and revenge taking center stage. As Holly, Root, Butler, and Artemis race to save Haven City from being destroyed, some of the same characters from the first book make appearances--Foaly, Mulch Diggums, Cudgeon, and Captain Trouble. There's also a new foe in THE ARCTIC INCIDENT, Opal Koboi, to be dealt with. I highly recommend the ARTEMIS FOWL series to anyone and everyone. Highly enjoyable, thoroughly entertaining, and not soon forgotten.",TeensReadToo
9780786817078,"I've been trying to find a new series to hold me over until the next HARRY POTTER book--and I've finally found it. Meet Artemis Fowl the Second, a twelve-year-old genius who doesn't want to go to school, is worried about his mother's fragile mental health, is preoccupied with his father coming back from the dead, and who is determined to add to his family's coffers by any means possible. In a word, Artemis is an evil genius, and you just can't help but love him. Or hate him. Or love to hate him. Or hate to love him. Or...well, you get the picture. Artemis, along with his bodyguard/manservant/butler ironically named, of all things, Butler, Artemis sets out on his greatest, and most ambitious, scheme to date--discover the secrets of the fairy world, and relieve some of said fairies of their precious gold. After all, they have plenty to spare, and since Artemis Fowl the First lost a vast majority of their fortune, the Fowl family needs to pad the coffers. So off Artemis sets on a world jaunt to discover the secrets of the fairies, and his ambitions and delusions finally pay off--he meets an alcoholic sprite who, in exchange for the return of her magic, lets Artemis get a good look at her Book. The Book, you see, contains all the mandates, rules, and regulations (along with a slew of secrets) of the fairy world--and now Artemis Fowl is able to hatch his nefarious scheme. Artemis discovers that the fairies must adhere to very specific rituals to renew their powers, so along with Butler, he sets out on a stakeout to catch himself a fairy. Hoping, of course, that he can hold said fairy for ransom in exchange for some gold. What Artemis didn't include in his calculations, however, was Captain Holly Short. A member of the LEPrecon Unit, Holly, although a small sprite, is very human looking--and can be extremely wily and dangerous. As Artemis implements his evil plan, Holly uses her military style background to hatch her own plan of escape. The results are both disastrous and hilarious. I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one sitting. Once you get started on this story of the human world of the Mud People mixing with that of the magical beings who live below ground, you just can't stop! The magical quality of the book is that it is all too believable and so much fun! You envy Artemis his brilliance and at the same time you can't believe how undeniably evil he is. You pity him, and you despise him, yet you adore him. As for Holly Short, you love the fairy, admire her tenacity, yet hope at the same time that she spares the lives of Artemis, Butler, and Butler's sister, Juliet.

9780545158893,"This is a good one! Starts out totally creepy and doesn't let up until the end. Billy narrates his own story of summer camp and weird things happen right from the bus trip out there, things get dangerous, spooky, kids disappear, etc. until the final twist ending. Which is pretty good even though I did figure it out but what you don't see coming is the extra, extra twist on the last page, last paragraph that cues that awesome Twilight Zone music for a super horror story ending. Fun!",Nicola Mansfield
9780545158862,"Not as good as previous books I've read in this series. The scare factor just wasn't there and even though the chapters ended in Stine's classic cliffhangers he didn't manage to grip me. Not a creepy story at all but he did manage to make a good mystery. The identity of the werewolf was kept a secret until the very end, with there being a few clues to possible suspects. I wasn't surprised who it turned out to be but I hadn't figured it out for sure myself either. Readable, just not one of the best.",Nicola Mansfield

9780590629775,"""...These books were right up there with Baby-Sitters Club and Goosebumps when I was a kid; come Book Fair time, Animorphs were certainly at the top of the Want List. There is something very appealing about having the power to change into any animal at will, and to do so in order to fight for the human race would be pretty awesome. Reading it again as an adult, I realize how cheesy the writing is, but I imagine it isn't so easy to write in the voice of a pre-teen or teenager in a way that might be believable enough to keep the target audience invested in the characters - especially when the way kids talk changes so much over the years...""

9781927925164,"I received an eARC copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. Here is my honest review. I've seen the play/musical production of Les Miserables so when I saw a graphic novel adaptation I wanted to visit the story again. It is enjoyable to read and I think my rating would be higher if I had had a print copy to review rather than a digital copy. It was difficult at times to read given the size constraints. I would see this as a quick way to cover a great piece of literature in an English class. It would definitely appeal to students who do not consider reading or literature to be pursuits that they especially enjoy. Some may feel that it is a disservice to a classic piece of literature. I believe that as teachers, we should honor all forms of the written word and encourage kids to read what they will find enjoyable. When kids enjoy reading, they read more. The more they read, the better their vocabulary and ability to relate to a wide variety of experiences.",Cassie Larson
9781927925171,"I received an eARC copy of this book from the publisher. Here is my honest review. I recall enjoying Archie comics when I was a kid but as a teen and then into adulthood, comics and graphic novels have not been a genre that I was drawn to. Perhaps it was the subject matter that tended to be more dark and violent. Despite my earlier hesitations, I requested this adaptation along with the Les Miserables Manga adaptations by Udon Entertainment. I am so happy that I did! The adaptation of Pride and Prejudice by Stacy King and Po Tse is beautifully done! The illustrations are gorgeous; Regency fashion is one of my favorite elements from the period and I adored seeing them portrayed so beautifully and accurately. The text is also well done and flows nicely along. There are some parts that seem so true to the writing style and language of Austen. At the same time, there were a few times where it seemed the speech was much more modern, a choice that will make this text appealing to younger readers who may hesitate to delve into a classic.",Cassie Larson
9781927925171,"I received this from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review I absolutely loved this! It is such a cute and enjoyable read that I can't image anyone not liking it. P&P is one of my all-time favorite book - if not THE favorite and this graphic novel/manga is almost true to the story. Some parts are left out and others are put together to make it easier to understand. Even though it's not a 100% true to the story it's so close that I think every Austenite will like it. I really liked the illustrations as well and I loved that there were pages with labels for the characters so we knew which were which instead of having to guess. I feared that I wouldn't enjoy it since it's manga and the characters are therefore drawn like regular mangas, but I actually really liked that part. It gave the classic this modern twist that I really enjoyed. I will probably have to buy an edition of this just so I can look at it everyday, I absolutely love it. I can totally imagine pupils reading this for class assignments or things alike. I love how this can be read for pleasure and in school. I definitely recommend this.",AmandaEmma
9781402217753,"Acquired: Borrowed a copy from the local library. Reason for Reading: I thought ds should be able to read this as his reader and I had read good reviews of how funny they were. First, we must get one thing straight. Henry is a horrid little boy. He is naughty, likes to cause trouble, is contrary on purpose, likes to make his perfect brother miserable and is never happy unless he gets his own way. Each book contains four short stories and in no way whatsoever does Henry ever learn a lesson, have things turn out bad for him or say he's sorry at the end. No, Henry may have things go not quite the way he planned at the beginning but they only turn out better than he had planned and in the end he gets what he wanted or even better. Henry is no role model, nor can we learn a life lesson from him BUT he is absolutely hilarious, laugh out loud funny. My son wants to read more books in the series and even if he didn't, I would read them on my own and I am way out of the 7 to 10 recommended age group! This is the first book written and so the first story simply introduces us to horrid Henry and his brother perfect Peter. Henry decides to try being perfect for a day to see what it is like and while he finds it irritating at times, he so confuses his parents and annoys his brother that Peter gets into trouble for a change and Henry can't stop laughing and ends up in his room as usual. Next Henry causes a ruckus at dance class; he'd rather go to karate lessons. Practicing to be a raindrop for Henry is more fun when he does his elephant dance and one thing leads to another until he's finally kicked out of dance class. Hopefully karate classes will now fill in the free time on Saturdays. Then Henry gets together with his neighbour Moody Margaret and the two of them end up in the kitchen making a disgusting, gloopy, gummy, greasy mess called Glop, which they've dared each other to eat. Finally, we end with a camping trip, but Henry's idea of a campground and that of his parent's vary from each other considerably. He wants to go where Moody Margaret's family goes: they have electricity, a pool, TVs, a fridge, a shower and more. Mom and Dad want to go back to nature. Let's just say that when Harry is finished with them, Mom and Dad may never want to be left alone with nature again! Hilarious! Ds did a good job of reading the book, too! It was just a tad over his ability but he enjoyed the stories so much he just kept on going!",Nicola Mansfield
9781402238253,"Reason for Reading: Our son has reading difficulties and after much debate the family bought an ereader. Ds read this book aloud as his reader and as his very first ebook. Horrid Henry is a favourite of his. This book was exactly what one expects from Horrid Henry. After having read only the first book in the series ds and I are both fans. Reading this book further along in the series we found two things had changed, Henry has gotten somewhat meaner *but* he usually ends up with the short end of the stick when all is said and done, which makes his escapades easier to swallow when you know he won't totally get away with it. Ds finds Harry funny and is continuously going ""Oh Man!"" with the things he gets up to but ds also thinks Henry is a bit too much and takes things too far. He wouldn't like to have him in his class, that is for sure! We both really enjoyed all the stories in this book and we agree upon our favourite being the titular one where he accidentally wears girl's underwear to school. This book was very hard for ds to read, so we read pretty much in tandem with me reading any words he struggled with to avoid frustration as he thoroughly enjoyed the ebook reading experience and took to it like a fish to water. He says he wants all his books on the Kindle now. Well that isn't going to exactly happen but we are going to take advantage of this format and see if it is the thing that will set off his reading abilities.",Nicola Mansfield

9781607064077,"This is kind of an origin book, not for the evil school, but for our six characters. Each of them gets an issue which delves a little into their past. It does double the amount of questions that you have and makes the book seem much more fragmented than the first volume but you don't mind. This is definitely a brave book with the mystery increasing exponentially and flashing back (and maybe forward) in time so there is a lot to keep track of. There are some interesting decisions such as the importance of a cheerleading team in a school for psychopaths but on the whole you want to stick with it. It's the throwaway comments that really get your interest and make this feel like a very measured and controlled enigma. The art is just as good as the first volume and there are some very subtle changes to the style during flashbacks that works particularly well. The covers - which are gorgeous - have been included before each issue. As these are single issue tales this works but hopefully we will go back to the seamless story of the first volume next time. A very high Thumbs Up indeed!",365 Graphic Novels
9781607065586,"Wow! Just wow! Even though the mysteries are getting deeper, the puzzles more cryptic and the answers few and far between you are completely hooked. This volume continues to focus on just a few characters at a time so that it can tell a proper story and really engage you emotionally. Those you thought were mere stereotypes get a lot of time to shine and really surprise you. The time travel/ alternate reality goes through the roof and you start to think taking notes might be a great idea. You have no idea who is who and behind what but everything is just so well-crafted and enthralling you don't care. You hang on tight and place your trust in the writer that everything will be explained when the time is right. There is some fantastic dialogue here with brilliantly natural conversations, but that doesn't make the most of the format. Although the accompanying art is superb there are a lot of talking heads. The art is superb with amazing colours and some brilliant lighting effects. All the jazzy stuff like digital blurring and silhouettes are used only when absolutely necessary. These are here to tell the story not to cover up how bad it is. The covers - most of which are mini works of art - are within the book, which given the episodic nature is fine. I am totally lost and my head is spinning but I really, really, really need the next volume NOW! For that expert addiction I give it the Double Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels
9781607067276,ItC/??s back! The cross between Grange Hill and Lost hits us with another chunky volume ending season one of its story. This title is almost a victim of its own success. The plot is so elaborate and sophisticated it is almost impossible to comprehend in separate parts. The easiest and most enjoyable way to deal with this wonderful series is to read the whole thing from start to finish after it has ended. But if you have already started you will be clamouring for this volume. Just make sure you re-read what has gone before as this hits the ground running. To be fair this volume does give you a better idea of what is happening and who people really are. There is also enough Biblical mythos thrown about that you can put some of the bigger picture together too. The ending is dramatic but importantly has a sense of closure. There is a lot of time travel in this issue and we are jumping backwards and forward every few pages. While this works in TV it isnC/??t so hot in print. Things are very clearly labelled both in art and words however so you donC/??t get confused. The art is staggering as always. It is almost impossible to appreciate standards this high in a monthly title. The colours are amazing with fabulous lighting and wonderful characterisation. There is a mute beginning and plenty of full page panels showing off just what pictures can do. The art needs to be this good however as this is an incredibly wordy book with endless dialogue. Every few pages you will have a disembodied black or white background. Whilst these donC/??t derail the flow entirely they are a disappointment to such a sumptuous book. A very high Thumbs Up!,365 Graphic Novels
9781607067740,This marks the start of Season Two but things pick up EXACTLY where they left off and with the same gigantic mystery. There is a wonderfully wordless beginning and early on there are a lot of mute pages. Clearly Spencer is now assured of his success and can get comfy. Unfortunately there are a lot of talking head pages later on and no matter how much dialogue takes place very little light is shed on what is going on. The art is so gorgeous that in some senses this doesn?C/??t matter. You are happy just to hang on and let the story meander through the surreal in its own sweet time. Some readers might be getting grumpy about the lack of revelation and this is certainly one series that deserves to be read in one sitting and not a book every six months.

9781607068235,"Welcome to another instalment of Teen Lost. I was about to give up on Morning Glories before this book. Not because it isna??t great but because enjoying such a rich and ambitious story in such infrequent instalments is really unsatisfying. This short volume continues on with the usual mind-bending complexity, time travelling and flashback-laden action. It lurches between behemoth plot and touching human drama with its massive cast getting the screen-time of Mayflies. But it is just so beautiful. The art is fantastic and only breaks out of square panels where absolutely necessary. The colouring is luxurious to the extreme. The covers are, of course, to die for. This is an easier read than the last one with the talking heads spread out more and interleaved better with the visuals. There are a lot more literary and pop culture references in this book which can be quite distracting but ita??s nice to see Spencer showing off his reading habits. There is a variant cover gallery some of which have interesting ides but none of which can match the majesty of Esquejo. There are also two pages of art process examples, presumably just to fill space.",365 Graphic Novels
9781607064305,"A group of teenagers are sent to an exclusive prep school but quickly learn it has a nefarious agenda. This is a really fresh, exciting read. It is full of original ideas and doesn't ape any previous titles or genres. It is engaging and gives you just enough information to keep you hooked but always stays half a step ahead of you. It does remind me of the films The Cube or The Exam in that you have people in a dangerous and unknown situation; perhaps with a little bit of Lost thrown in for the mystery. The art is good solid fare that Image is known for. Less detail and more colour. There are some superb dialogue free action scenes that really capture you and don't just feel like padding. The panels are straight edges and traditional grid but the size and layout varies according to the needs of the story and not for gratuity. There are no issue covers within the book so the whole thing seems like one seamless read from start to end which is a nice touch. You can never quite work out what is going on but always feel like the answer is just out of reach. It is everything a great mystery should be. Despite all the lead characters being modern teenagers their annoying habits and grating personalities all feel appropriate to kids today and don't alienate you from them. While they may start as stereotypes they do grow and you get to see the layers in their personality. This is a great read and everything a Thumbs Up should be!",365 Graphic Novels

9781904233657,"Twilight was my first ""bridge"" to vampire romance and the return to reading daily several genres of books. My love for other worlds beyond the pages was always an addiction and this book hit the target. So about Bella, she was to me a very grown up character and very well created heroin. With her soft, quiet personality, she is the image that simple is beautiful. Edward was the prince charming that everyone dreamed of at that age. Protective and dangerous, a vampire should you imagine, that falls hopelessly in love with a weak mortal woman. This two along with the feelings that words can take effect on readers along this ride created a recipe for success that took over the world by storm and entered in our tv and movie screens to always remember love.",Patricia Melo
9781904233657,The plot is not written very well at all. The characters are undefined and static.

9781904233657,"Unlike previous reviews that have been written for this book mine will not have unwarranted capital letters and exclamation points (In the intrest of your sanity). This novel has a very boring, plain and not-very-well-described main character - Bella. This was most likely done in an effort so the tween females reading the novel can imprint their own personalities and looks onto her, and have vampire fantasies. There is no denying that the dominant reading portrays females as damsels in distress, unintelligent and always in need of a male to be around. In my opinion, Stephenie Meyer should have focused more on the vampire side of the story - going into more depth with those characters and their abilities. In addition, to, of course giving the main characters - Edward aswell as Bella, personality. There is literally no word-painting in this novel. Overall, Your'e going to read it anyway because of how successful it is therefore this review is redundant.",Andi

9781904233916,"Eclipse was a lot better than New Moon plot-wise, but I wish the whole Bella x Edward x Jacob didn't exist. This is just about me, personally, but I hate love triangles. I know other people do, too. I don't believe a person can LOVE two people in the same time. Crush, be attracted to... yes. But not love. Some books manage to make it in a way I don't mind the love triangle that much. Unfortunately, Eclipse is not one of these cases. Considering the Twilight Saga deals with the supposedly ultimate love between Edward and Bella, it's even more aggravating that Meyer chose to push this series into a love triangle. How can you expect us to believe, as we did in Twilight, that these two truly have the purest and deepest love, if Bella herself doesn't seem so sure of that? In fact, she's so unsure she falls for another guy. I didn't stomach this well, to say the least. I also found Bella's behavior infuriating; for someone who basically gave up living the moment Edward was out of her life, she is very... fickle. Also, this book just emphasizes how useless Bella is - the only thing she's good for is... bait?! I wish she was stronger, more meaningful. As for Edward... I still love the guy--hard to erase the major crush I got on him the first book, despite everything he had done since--but he, too, could afford to be more headstrong. I mean, his girl kinda cheats on him and he's as calm about it as can be - because he 'brought it on himself'. I mean, yes - he did. But, dude, show some emotion about it! With all me saying that, Eclipse still had one of my most favorite scenes in the whole book and I did enjoy this book.

I've never read any other romance novels and Meyer's seriously making me regret for not immersing myself more into romantic english literature 20 yrs ago at high school. This series is so good that i'm sad to be moving onto the final book next. If u've only read Twilight book 1, then u're missing out on more Twilighting. Btw, Meyer's writing skill improves with every book, and of course her storytelling style is as good as always.",Kim
9781904233916,"This book is probably the most emotional of the series. With the lives of dozens of other vampires in danger (you'll definitely need the list provided at the back of the book to keep track of all the new characters), the stakes are higher than ever. It's easy to understand the motives for the sacrifices the characters are forced to make, and the plot twists and constant action will definitely keep you up late flipping all 756 pages. Besides, despite the danger, the book isn't always serious. Emmett has plenty of irritating-big-brother jokes at the newlyweds' expense, and it's fun to see Bella finally be able to kick some butt as a ""newborn."" Overall, reading Breaking Dawn was a pleasure. Stephenie Meyer is great at what she does, great at writing for her audience, and if you can recognize that, can see that this book is exactly what it is meant to be and not expect more from it, you'll love it.

9781904233886,"This is the second book of the Twilight Saga, and honestly, i loved it more than the first book. New Moon took alot of time from me to finish. I just would stop it, read another book, then read some of it, then stop it again, then read another book, and so on. But now, i read over 300 pages in 2 days. I LOVED it. I loved it at the beginning too, it was just that i felt lazy to continue reading it. If you havent read the first book, i advise you not to continue reading, in case i might spoil anything for you. Anyways, what i loved about this book, is how Jacob had a HUGE part. Im Team Jacob, and i just love Jacob, and i was so excited throughout the book because all of the time i was reading about him and Bella. It was different than the first book because this time, it wasnt all about the Vampires. It was more about the (SPOILER) were-wolves. Which i LOVED. Gaah i imagine them to be so hot in my head. hehehhe. What kind of bored me out, was how loooong it took for Edward to show up. I mean, everybody obviously knew he was going to come back, but it took soo long. So it kind of pissed me off when i read how depressed Bella was over and over again. After Edward does show up, maaan it was ADDICTING! The book was sooo exciting and i just couldnt put it down. So i rated this book a 5 because, i really did truly love it.

9781904233886,"After reading the first book of the ""Twilight"" saga I have high hopes for the second book to exceed the success of the first one but surely I felt let down. The beginning of the book is at it's most exciting and compelling but as it went on the middle part started to drag and remembering asking myself whether it was still well worth the effort to finish it. Compared to twilight this book is no match, with plots that needs mending, main characters needs rebuffing. Edward decided to leave Bella after her disastrous 18th birthday celebration at the Cullen's house. She became depressed to the point of being catatonic and still continues to be a danger magnet. Re-introduce into the picture is Jacob Black, the boy that Bella met at La Push during a beach party. A book of hope, love, forgiveness and friendship all in all still a good book to read.",R.D-Diaz

But then I thought why not? Is twilight related, and is online free - at least till 5th July And I'm sooo glad I've read it. I like Bree a lot. She's no dull veggie vampire. She's the real thing - despite of the sparkling on the sun, but hey, don't forget is twilight. She didn't have the choice to become a vampire, but she manages the best she can, trying to survive one day at a time. This book clearly benefits from being the fifth on the series, and a short one. The characters are strong and it has no time to be boring. Vampires lie. Vampires deceive. Vampires fight and kill humans just because they can. Vampires are cruel. They are immortal, and sometimes they love. An Eclipse's spin-off better than the original.",Sonia Carrao
9781907410369,"So I read The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner a few months back and I read it in two days I really thoroughly enjoyed it. Stephenie gives us a real insight as too what newborn blood thirsty vampires are really like and shows us the emotions they go through since we have recondition of this in The Twilight Saga (Twilight, New moon, Eclipse and Breaking dawn) we do hear a tiny bit of what Jasper's life was like in Eclipse and what it was like for him but as all the books are in Bella's perspective we are not really able to know what it is like and this book reveals all. Starting with Bree we all know she surrenders herself to Carlisle in Eclipse that was the first we read of her little did we know that she would have her own novella. When I started reading The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner I started to see a side of her that I thought wasn't even possible and I read on more I started to really like her character she isn't the evil new born we all thought she was but a young vulnerable girl that Riley kills for Victoria's army. Bree becomes good friends with another vampire Riley has created and by reading it you can see they are starting to fall for each other. When I read it I cried that Bree died because I really didn't want her too even though I knew she was going to die. The vampire that Bree starts to have a close bond with is Diego. Though they only started to really bond in one day it shows you they are intense about each other. Diego was another character I started to really like in the book. When I read he was dead it felt like an important character was gone. I had started to really like reading about Bree and Diego and although both of them die it's kind of like a love story for them. I would have loved for them to both stay alive. There is a vampire called Fred who has quite an unusual gift. He is interesting because his gift has never been known to us. Fred can make vampires stay away from him, he can make vampires feel like they are repulsed if they go near him. He is also very quiet that some vampire would not know he exists. Near the end of the book he pulls Bree to one corner when they are leaving to go to the clearing and asks her to away with him to not fight and to leave Riley but we know she doesn't because Riley has told her that Diego is waiting for her at the clearing and she wants to go see him so Fred leaves on his own and asks her to meet him the next day if she survives. We get to see a close friend-ship that could have been if Bree had been kept alive between Bree and Fred. The character who I ended up hating and was glad that dies was Riley. In Eclipse all we find out about him is that he loves Victoria and thinks she does to. But we know she doesn't. We read that Riley in fact kills Diego and doesn't tell Bree. He lies to her the whole time. To me at the start before he changes her he kind of manipulates her. I am really glad he died. In the book there is a surprise that everyone had no idea about! The Volturi pay a visit to Victoria. We know this as Bree and Diego are close to the house to where Victoria is staying when they arrive. The Volturi knew exactly what Victoria was up to and told her to make sure she succeeds in killing the Cullen's. We know Edward finds this out as Bree thinks it so she can tel him everything she knows. To me The Second Short Life of Bree Tanner is a must-have for all Twilight Saga fans. It was an amazing story that I could read and read again. With surprises, knowledge and a great insight to blood thirsty new born vampires!

9781907410369,"For Bree life began in a burning flame of agony, before that all her memories are dark and murky. With the life Bree led as a human it is hardly surprising she prefers life as a strong and powerful vampire. But life as an all but immortal 'God' is not all its cracked up to be. As a newborn Bree spends most of her time thinking about feeding, with the constant thirst burning in her throat there is little chance for anything else. But a series of events will lead her to question all that she has been taught about her new life and she comes to realise that she is being kept in the dark in more ways then one. The Short Second Life Of Bree Tanner is a bitter-sweet Eclipse Novella highlighting a life of a girl smart enough to discover a truth no one is able to see, but not quite strong enough to walk away when she had the chance. If a vicious and violent newborn is able to find friendships and love where her human self could not then her second life as a vampire, as short as it was, was well worth the pain. A great insight into the events in Eclipse, this is one for the fans.",Larissa McGrath

So I wasn't going to read this book until I broke my arm and my parents wanted to give me a gift. I pick it up, and I was instantly hooked. The writing reminded me why I read and enjoyed Twilight. It may not be a classic, but it doesn't let you go. I just kept reading until I finished. I vaguely remembered Bree from her 5 seconds of fame at Eclipse, but of course in this book she is the main character. She is a very young girl with a good heart. Nervous and very scared, in a way she remind me of Bella. It was nice to read her, easy. She makes you feel comfortable. The story was much more than I was expecting, but that is probably because I wasn't expecting anything at all. You get to read more about vampires, specially newborn, but I didn't read anything new about that.

Bella is left devastated and can't bring herself out of depression for a couple of months until she decided to see Jacob.

Edward maintains that Bella is still dead and like Romeo and Juliet, decides he can't live without her and is ready to die for that cause.

9780316027656,"Eclipse is the third book in Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series and continues on from where the previous book left off. In New Moon (the second book), Bella is left alone after Edward decides its best if he no longer see Bella. Jacob fills Bella's void and she learns that he's become a werewolf. The third book is a twist on that because Jacob and Edward (the warewolves and the vampires) form an alliance to destroy Victoria (an evil vampire) and her newborns (new vampires). Bella no longer finds that she is split - in having to choose between warewolves and vampires (Jacob and Edward) because she can have both. Jacob declares his love for Bella but Bella remains true to Edward. Bella is given an engagement ring from Edward towards the end of the novel. True Twilight fans will find themselves battling between team Edward and team Jacob in this book but I found the story seemed to go in circles between the two of them.

The first installment of The Twilight Saga starts off pretty slow, but continues on in becoming interesting as you go from chapter to chapter. Many have been ridiculing this Novel/Series, and from my perspective it may be because of the built-up hype and opposition of it's chosen character representatives. It's a young adult book that can pull the heart strings, a soft as well as humorous vampire-werewolf scenario, and a love triangle to add (or could it be a love-quad...i.e. Mike) I enjoyed this novel as I read it all the way through to the last book (Breaking Dawn).

9780316067935,"The fourth and final chapter of Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT series is sure to please readers. Bella has a tough decision ahead of her: eternal life or death. Should she live forever with the love of her life, her fiance and vampire Edward Cullen? Or should she choose life -- and maybe her best friend who is completely in love with her, Jacob Black -- and face death that will eventually come? That is the big decision that Bella faces, but of course the road down the path to the outcome isn't easy. Many events happen that alter Bella's life forever, leaving both the reader and Bella dazed. BREAKING DAWN ends the series very nicely. Throughout its seven-hundred pages, the reader is engrossed in the drama and action-packed tale of an ordinary girl in a pseudo-ordinary world. The reader should be cautioned that fits of increased heart rate and frustration might raise the desire to hurl the book across the room while reading this last installment of the very popular series. While some could argue that there is simply too much ""drama"" -- so much at times that it seems another book may have been of better benefit to the readers' health -- the book is nevertheless entertaining and delightful. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9781406330335,"I was missing Jace and Clary so much I had to pick this book up after it sitting on my shelf since Christmas. I had pledged to ready only author's I'd never read before in January, and after the month was over I had already moved past all my feels about the first three Mortal Instrument's books. Now I'm really glad I waited and could experience this lovely Shadowhunter world again. Revisiting a familiar fictional world is like coming home, comfortable and fabulous I almost gave this book four stars. It really wasn't as good as the first three, mainly because it was so chaotic. I felt like I was reading the Simon show. I understand that there are more characters than just Jace and Clary, so I am probably biased, but I really did get bored with so much Simon drama. The emotions Jace and Clary went through felt a bit forced, as if there really wasn't anything for Cassandra to create to cause issues with them so she just came up with whatever was easy. I didn't feel their 'troubles' were realistic, even though Shadowhunter's are fictional, the situation just wasn't as believable for that type of setting that it was in the previous books. I know it all tied in together in the end and made sense, I just felt like there could have been a better plot line for that particular section of the book. I was intrigued by the bits of information we learned about some of the other characters, Magnus and Maia. Their pasts were discussed and elaborated on, but I felt like there could have been a little more information provided. I know that there is going to be a Bane Chronicles to give us the information on Magnus as well. I haven't read The Infernal Devices yet, so I don't know if he's in those. The thing about Cassandra Clare's writing style is that it's so easy to read. It flows beautifully and you can speed through her books without feeling like you were cheated. Her writing always leaves me wanting more. We also get a glimpse of what I like to call #TeamMalec. I always get a bit fangirl over any ""Malec"" information and again, I wanted more :) Plot wise, it was all over the place. It felt like riding a roller coaster, there were so many twists and turns. New bad guys, or should I say bad girls, were introduced and a reappearance of a former menace within the last few pages left a cliff hanger so intense that I almost ran to my room and picked up the last book immediately. I had to contain myself because I want to read other books, but I really cannot wait to pick up the next one. All in all this was a magnificent addition to the series. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars, but again, I'm biased for anything Jace/Clary and #TeamMalec Recommendation: I suggest you read this one immediately. If you've read the first three, then keep on trucking partner because this one will not disappoint. It's not the best of the series, but it's really not bad either.",Whytnee shattuck

9781406307627,"I had seen this book pop up on my updates-feed on goodreads so many times, that when I came across it at my library, I had to take it home with me. I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading this book, but I wanted to find out what the fuss was about. It seems that people either hate or love this book. And I ended up kind of loving it. City of Bones is the first instalment in the Mortal Instruments series. What I really liked about this book from the start is that it is set in modern times in New York City. Of course, many books are set in New York City (the Princess Diaries for example, a series I absolutely love, by the way) but this is fantasy. I had never read fantasy before that's set in NYC, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, City of Bones is about a teenage girl named Clary Fray whose mother is super overprotective and whose father died before she was even born. When she goes out clubbin' with her homie Simon - who's like a brother to her - she sees three teenagers kill this creepy dude. These three killers turn out to be Shadowhunters. ""What are Shadowhunters?"" you ask? If you really want to find out, I suggest you read this book, but in short: Shadowhunters are part angel, part demon fighting warriors. They're pretty badass and they basically protect us humans - or mundanes, as they like to call us - from demons. Which is pretty nice of them, isn't it? Clary is pretty freaked out after witnessing a murder. Unfortunately, this isn't the last time Clary encounters Shadowhunters, because soon her mother disappears and she gets attacked by a demon herself. This book is filled with hilarious dialogues and fast-paced action sequences. Perhaps it's just me, but I thought the action scenes were rather bloody. I didn't mind it, but I guess I'm not used to it. What I also really liked about this book were the characters. I must admit that not all of them were very original, but more on that later. I really liked the fact that so many characters dropped by in the storyline. You've got your five main characters: Clary, Simon, Jace, Isabelle and Alec. But there are also many characters that are only present for like a chapter or two, like Magnus Bane and Raphael. And I hope that, if those characters survived the first book, they'll reappear in one of the others books in the series as well. Those who hate on this book say, amongst many other things, that this book is very predictable. Now I did feel for the first half of the book, that I knew exactly what was going to happen. And I did predict several developments of the plot correctly. But the last 100 pages or so completely made up for that, because it contained one big plot twist and a couple of small ones. My mind was pretty blown after that plot twist. And I really enjoyed that. Another thing the haters argue is that many elements of City of Bones were copied and slightly altered from the Harry Potter-series. I did read somewhere on the interwebs ???????????????- and we all know how reliable that information is - that Clare originally started writing Harry Potter fan fiction. And that some paragraphs from those works were altered and used in City of Bones. Furthermore, I am able to recognize elements from Harry Potter in this book if I pay close attention to it. But I don't really want to. And I recommend you to not do so either, if you just want to get a good read out of this book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm definitely going to read the other ones in the series. I love reading about fantasy worlds that exist in our ""real"" world and the world of the Shadowhunters is a good example of that, although it might resemble the world of Harry Potter a little. Maybe that is exactly why I liked this book so much. After all I love the Harry Potter-books with all my heart and more!",Enya Wouts

There are some nice morals for young readers, but not in a preachy kind of way. Again, it's not quite as action-packed as some of the others in the series, this book is very captivating, and you really get a sense of it building up to the others; having re-read it, I am eager to finish re-reading the rest of them!""

9780786947812,"""Picking this up from the post I was looking forward to opening a book which helped create interesting battles that were barely touched upon in the core rule book. Man, was I disappointed. As the title suggests the book is nothing more than a load of stat blocks with a couple, and I mean a couple, of races, talents, feats and pieces of equipment scattered about in there. Compared to the well written but brief core rule book and the fantastic starships update this book has very little to offer GM's unless they are lazy and far less to offer players, the Star Wars Monster Manual it certainly isn't. The book is split up into 3 sections: Characters, Creatures and Droids. The 1st section, characters is the biggest of the 3, spanning 103 of the paltry 160 pages (even though it is the same page count as SOTG)it contains stats from soldiers to elite soldiers to warriors to elite warriors almost repeating itself in the process. The odd legendary charcter makes an appearance but most are of little importance or don't fit in the timeframe of any campaign. There are ""guides"" to encounters with almost every entry but most are stating the obvious, revealing tactics that even first time GM's shouldn't have much trouble coming up with themselves. My main gripe is that there is no guide on what CL opponents should be, especially those with levels in nonheroic and as such seemingly different powered opponents share a similar CL. In reality you could make more challenging and better suited NPC's in less than hour using the core book. The next section, creatures, which gives a few blocks for popular creatures such as rancor and the sarlacc and a few other beasts like the Vornskr hounds and Ysalamiri but no guide on creating new creatures and barely even a description of their habitat, eating habits or even if they would attack a character on sight or only fight if backed in a corner. Yet again there seems to be disagreements on the CL's of different creatures and considering the range of wonderful creatures out there in the SW universe, this is a very thin section. Which leads me on to the final section, droids. This makes no attempt to build on the droids chapter in the core rulebook merely presenting examples of different types of droids which again you could probably create yourself in less than an hour. All in all a very disappointing book which fails to build on the well laid out rules of its predecessors leaving us hoping that Wizards can pull it back together for the upcoming Clone Wars campaign setting.""",a Book Depository customer

9780141321271,"# Awesome! Reviewed by Adrian W. | see all reviews by Adrian W. 22/11/2010 Finally, we get into the really good stuff. It felt likes this is the story Riordan wanted to be telling all along, and that THE SEA OF MONSTERS and THE TITAN'S CURSE were just necessary set-ups. Nico di Angelo has rapidly become a really engaging character, too. I was glad that Riordan finally seemed to find the balance between referencing Greek myths and just retelling them with his characters - sure, we had Percy cleaning out Geryon's stables as Heracles once did, but that was one small, relevant part of a larger quest, not the be all and end all as these ""references"" were in the last two books. The ending had me a bit peeved, though - we keep learning how nutso the gods can be, but when Hera is ****** at Annabeth, she doesn't just smite her. What gives? Anyway, I've gone from wanting the series to hurry up and get better to being disappointed there isn't much more to go. Great stuff!",Adrian J. Watts
9780141321288,"This book is the best of the Percy Jackson series. It is an unputdownable book. There aren't enough word in a dictionary to describe this book. It has everything a good book should have a bit of romance, just enough history and mythology to keep you interested and a whole lot of action. It is a very original story because the author combines all the old mythological stories and heroes with modern life. Rick Riordan describe the scenes and the situations that Percy and Annabeth encounter so vividly that you think that you are with the characters, fighting with them, journeying with them and even exploring Camp-HalfBlood with them. It is a thrilling book which I enjoyed rereading over and over again. If you liked the other Percy Jackson book you'll love this one.",andrea cini96
9780141321264,"The third instalment of the Percy Jackson series takes on a now familiar format of Percy, along with a few others, setting out on a quest which has him fighting all kinds of mythological creatures along the way. This time he is trying to rescue both the goddess Artemis and his fellow half-blood Annabeth. This book is different from the others in that we meet Artemis' hunters as well as getting to know Thalia, daughter of Zeus. There's also a bunch of new characters, with at least one of which who will prove to be all important in the over all story arc of the series. I liked that we are now able to jump straight into the story without to much explanation of the story world and that we're getting to find out more and more about the Gods and the prophecy which predicts the fall of Olympus. The Titan's Curse felt like it was starting to set up the final two books of the series, with just a few hints here and there of what might follow in the future. While the Percy Jackson books fall in the Middle School age bracket, they can definitely be enjoyed by all. There's so much detail and action that it's easy to forget that you're reading a childrens/younger teen book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.",Tasha
9780141319148,"This book was definitely a good start: it made me interested in Greek mythology again! Let's see.. the last time I read something about Greek mythology, I was in seventh grade and we need it for school. Now, I want to dive for Bufinch's mythology and re-read it! Good thing my parents bought me a hardcover book -- it literally lasts so much longer! Anyway, the way Rick Riordan writes about the gods makes me feel as if they are alive, walking around earth and not just names from myths, legends, and lore. He also writes about these characters in such an unconventional way -- I love the fact that he doesn't portray Hades as a bad guy. In fact, Rick Riordan never really portrays any of the gods as bad people, just moody little beings. After all, these gods have every right to. They rule the earth, right? The characters are also smart, witty, funny and three-dimensional [well, except for Smelly Gabe for me. Gosh, I hate him!] The book is written in a humorous way to make the subject light while keeping the readers interested in the facts that the author is churning on about. Dang, now I wish these books had been written when I was a young adult. It'll make me remember more about these Olympians, quite useful if you have an exam or something! He even provides codes for you to remember the gods names alone - ie the formation of the gods in Olympus and in Camp Half-Blood, as well as numbers for each of the gods. Ingenius. This novel is very, very excellent. Good start for the rest of the series. It kept me hooked! And yes, I want to read the next novel, but will probably get a copy when I find one on sale. The cheapskate in me strikes again [then again, I have a bazillion interests to fund too]. So, is this the next Harry Potter series? Maybe. Maybe not, but Riordan certainly provided a breath of fresh air to an otherwise aging lore! This is very much worth your time and effort so do read it. The book isn't like the movie, don't be fooled!",Ruby Escalona
9780141319148,"Percy has almost made it througha whole year of school without being kicked out. Too good to be true? Sure it is. A run in with some monsters soon sees to that and has Percy fleeing to Camp Half-Blood where things aren't exactly as they were last year. Finding the Golden Fleece appears to be the answer to putting the camp back to how it should be and off course Percy's the one who gets to retrieve it, along with Annabeth, Clarrise and newcomer, Tyson. They also need to rescue Grover while they're at it. All in a days work for a half-blood. The Percy Jackson books pretty simple in style - Percy has to find something and deal with a whole load of mythical stuff on the way. It's mostly obvious what's going to happen before it does but there's a few twists and turns as well as the explanations of the myths that keep the interest factor.

9780064440752,"Nathaniel Benchley, who penned other vivid stories about animals, wrote ""Red Fox And His Canoe"" in 1964. An Aboriginal asks his Dad for the largest vessel he can build. Meant for small children, each illustration is smiling and introduces a lovely variety of animals. As the boy launches his craft the dialogue is perky , easy to understand, and involves no fear or peril. However the take-away education would apply to a great many grownups. Perhaps it is versatile because basic morals are at our disposal early. The protagonist, 'Red Fox' doesn't give a reason but thinks the biggest canoe available, would be ideal. Perhaps he wants to carry more fish and on his test paddle, he does gather a much bigger haul than usual. Perhaps he would like to invite the accompaniment of friends, which his humbler solo craft couldn't muster. What he does collect at the end of one day, is a boatload of uninvited critters. Crowding the owner himself, a cute variety of wildlife notice that off-shore fishing is easier. Constantly adding to the eclectic party, who 'Red Fox' can't chase out, opportunistic individuals seize on an easier way to fish by boating with him to the centre of rivers. This is a pickle in two ways. We want to help where we can, if we possess a resource others would be grateful to share. I think of folks who own trucks; never short of people needing something hauled. However we ought not take anyone for granted, nor outsource amenities until wear and tear occurs. We must not sacrifice the ability to enjoy our investment; sinking the craft and no one making use of it. It's a fine line between appearing selfish and reasonable self-defence. The tale made good, wry sense without ever feeling despairing or heavy.",C. Riedel

At times you may even find yourself feeling conflicted about your view towards this villain.

9781401216672,"I will be the first to admit that I have never really gone much on comics. I never grew up near a comic book store and so always relied on regular novels and children stories. However, I recently was introduced to the world of graphic novels and I haven't left yet. It's sad that this art form has such a poor reputation amongst the mass reading community; almost as if these are not legitimate forms of literature. They are so much more than this: they wonderfully combine the world of visual arts with the written word to produce a unique medium. Alan Moore takes the character of the Joker and provides some dark insight into his deranged perspective. The Killing Joke removes the veil of camp kitsch storytelling and delves into the darkness that is Gotham City and its Dark Knight. Even though the story is brief, it reveals so much about these characters. If you've never delved into the comic world, this is the perfect entree. Sharp writing and polished, detailed imagery.

9781401232139,"OK, you want me to tell you a story? Batman: Noel is quite a graphic novel. It takes a tip from Charles Dickens and creates its own version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" minus the ghosts. It is a commentary on the Dark Knight, a vigilante who tends to cross the line that others would fear to cross (Gordon said that). It's a narrative piece, where someone (we find out who at the end) is telling his kid a story, about Scrooge (Batman) and how he meets three people who make him take a look at his life and make some changes. As the novel says, some people need a wake-up call like getting hit with a baseball bat before they change! The hint of Christmas is muted in favor of a story of a guy (Bob) who is running some money for the Joker. The Batman jumps on Bob in his search for the Clown of Crime. The Bats has a run-in with Catwoman (who is nicely drawn) and Superman. The final confrontation with the Joker is meaningful and exciting in its storyline and art. Lee Bermejo draws some great panels. His use of shadow and light and conveying mood and mystery is really exciting. If I could nitpick, it's in the way he throws sweat and spit around. It's a good device to use, but it's over and over again to a point where the ""spit"" loses interest for me! Lee also wrote the story and the man really has a talent for the written word. Minimal, yet keeps it informal and interesting. Bottom Line: This is NOT an adaptation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It's a deep, dark and sometimes frightening look at a man who has crossed the line and has lost all hope in his quest to beat down the criminal element and ""reduce the criminal surplus population!"" It's a story that a man can change with some conviction and some tough love! Highly recommended.",James

Written and illustrated by comic industry professionals, the story and characters all have an authentic feel. Each chapter has at least one full page illustration, some even have two, the pages of pure text are broken up for the reader by using comic book style graphics, in colour, for all the sound effect words.

Soft ear of the elephant, sticky paint, fabric on the horses head and fabric on a girls dress. There are no more little rhymes.

9780141340135,"I didn't expect myself to actually pick up this book. For one, I never really liked the story of the Cinderella and to read a retelling wasn't really going to change my mind about Cinderella. But when I did start reading Cinder. I was excessively surprised when I realized it may have the vague skeleton of 'the Cinderella Plot' but it was a story that took it's own life and originality. Cinder is half-human half-robot aka a cyborg. Cyborgs, in this world, have very little rights and were considered nothing better than slaves. So, Cinder was the mechanic slave of her foster mother. All she does is work at the repair shop her family owns, eats, sleep and frequently get into arguments with her foster mother and her evil foster sister. I know, that sounds very Cinderella. But then the prince of New Beijing appears at her repair shop looking for the best mechanic in the city. He asks Cinder to repair his robot, Nancy. And Cinder manages to make an impression on him. Things escalate and the plague breaks out in the town center close to Cinder's booth, her nicer foster sister gets ill, her foster mother throws a fit and volunteers Cinder to the draft system. The draft system is where cyborgs are sent to become lab rats. They are then injected with the plague then injected again with the latest antidote to the plague to see if it works or not. Most cyborgs don't come out alive. I'm not sure what part of the book I actually liked the most, the hint of romance or the controversies and the dispute between Earth and the Moon. I'm not one for politics but in this book. I just want to get into it so I can find the way to get the crazy and disgusting queen of the moon off the backs of every one on Earth. She is way to manipulative and irritating to just let her be like that. Anyways, I linked Cinder a lot more than later because of her kick-buttery and her strength to keep going even after the only family she knew shunned her and society discriminating her because of her mechanical foot and hand. Having a strong protagonist like her to is one of the best factors a wonderful book needs to have. She was easy to relate to in one small way or another. Overall, I applaud the author for ending the book with the worst cliffhanger ever, and her tenacity to include a little bit of everything for different types of readers out there. If you're a big fan of Cinderella, Science Fiction and Dystopia, you will absolutely love this.",Najla Qamber
9780141340135,"Cinder is an amazing retelling of the Cinderella fairytale (in case that wasn't obvious). I'm not even sure I can explain just how great this book is, I loved it from the first page to the very last. When a story has cyborgs, princes, androids, aliens, a deadly plague that's bound to wipe out the human race, it's bound to be spectacular. Linh Cinder is a strong female character, her problems and insecurities only leading to her becoming even stronger. It's the first time I agree through and through with all of the character's decisions and ways of handling matters. You can also easily connect not just with her, but with the side characters as well. For example, there's a little child who appears briefly in the book, but it's one that definitely leaves an impression. The villain is absolutely fascinating! Queen Levana is an extremely powerful enemy, one that you should never ever cross. The entire Lunar race is so enjoyable to read, from their abilities to their quite large family tree :) There were a lot of plot twists that you could easily predict, however this just makes you want to keep on reading to see how everything unravels. And it wouldn't be Cinderella without a ball, right? That was by far my favorite scene from Cinder, so much was going on that I just couldn't put the book down. *Favorite quotes ""Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time."" ""Prince Kai! Check my fan, I think I'm overheating."" *Rating Characters: 5/5 Main character, side characters, every single person mentioned is amazeballs!! - except Adri, of course - Romance: 4/5 While I absolutely loved it, I wanted much much more (which I'm hoping we'll get in the sequel). Pacing/Length: 4.5/5 Don't get me wrong, the beginning of the book was interesting too, but in the end you were just getting your face slapped with constant action and plot twists and did I say action?! I'm well aware a book can't be all about that - and that's why the beginning was a tiny bit slower - , but the change was so quick that you can tell from where it started to get really good. Cover: 5/5 In love with it. Always have been, always will be. Plot: 5/5 DAMN this story is good.",Ioana Culcea
9780141340135,"Wow. This book was just AMAZING! From the first page to the last, it was gripping, interesting and mind blowing! I know a lot of people who were slightly disappointed, a lot of people who said this book could do without the Cinderella theme and all that, but I thought it perfect! I admit, at first I was reluctant to read Cinder. I don't even know why; it's just that among the many books on my To-Read list, this wasn't the one to pop out when I wondered what book to read. Maybe it was the fact it was a first in a new series, and I rarely read those. I hate the wait, you see. Maybe it was because it had cyborgs and all that, and I haven't read much-if any- of those; hence I didn't know if I'd like the genre or not. Boy, how I'm kicking myself right now over it! I can't believe I didn't read it sooner! Thank god for Goodreads group reads, otherwise it might've taken me ages to get to it! (Though, now I'm kicking myself for reading it because, honestly, how the hell am I supposed to wait until February 2013 for the next book?! And then another year for the next, and another one... I'll lose my mind! This is exactly why I don't do firsts in new series!) THE PlOT Cinder presents itself as a re-telling of Cinderella. In the city of New Beijing, lives Cinder - an orphan, a stepdaughter, and a possession. Her evil stepmother, Adri, treats her as a servant, and everything in the house is left upon her shoulders, while her adopted family spends the money she earns - never giving her a cent. Even when she really needs it. Then there is prince Kai, the crown prince of New Beijing, a figure many girls dream to meet and one day merry. And of course, there is a ball. And a shoe... sort of. Oh, and I forgot to mention: Cinder's a cyborg. No big deal. Yes, Cinderella is part metal, and honestly, calling this book a retelling of Cinderella is underrating it. Cinderella is the theme. But it's not the story. The story is about very deep things, when you think about it - It's about slavery and people-living people with hearts and minds-being treated like possession. Owned. It's about death and its horrific form. It's about dictatorship and its ugly face. And it's about finding yourself among it all. Or starting to, anyway. Besides, there were some striking differences between Cinder and Cinderella, all whom I'm sure you'll notice while reading. I don't want to give up too many details, but the story of Cinderella? You know, the one in which a servant girl desperately wants to go to the ball and dance with a prince, and a fairy comes and-well, you've seen the Disney movie. Well, Cinder has very little to do with that. Cinder is actually about a deadly plague, war threats from the Lunars - humans who live on the moon and long ago stopped being considered humans, and how someone different, not by his own fault, struggles with the difficulties that is his life. Meyer takes the fairytale, makes something entirely different to it and inside puts reference to the story we all know in ways that makes you quirk a smile. THE CHARACTERS The characters in the book were well developed and I found myself very emotionally invested in them. Cinder, heroine of the book and its namesake, is courageous, smart, strong and a little lost. She lives like a possession and wants her freedom, wishing she wasn't what she is. Wishing people would stop recoil or send her disgusted looks when they see her. Kai, prince of New Beijing, is the other main character of the book, who's POV we get to see from the second part of the book on. He's very likable, struggling with the many responsibilities suddenly put on his shoulders. He is sweet, charming and... well - princely? I guess the title ""prince charming"" fits him well. Then we have Adri, the evil stepmother, Pearl, the evil stepsister, Peony, the good stepsister, the Queen and a few more. All were well done and added to the story. I NEARLY CRIED You know a book is good when I nearly cry when it barely started. You know a book is good when in a couple of pages, it makes you so in tune and living the characters, that you cry for their loses. That you weep for their pain. That you pray for their lives. And this book did it. My eyes watered and I felt so sad, and I'm sure you'll know what I'm taking about once you read the book. THE WRITING Let's start with the simple - the writing style is simply engrossing. It sucks you right in, and I don't doubt for a minute that if I weren't busy with college (meaning: barely time to read) I would've finished this book in a single way. And then cried and whined for hours that it was over. Now, what I felt was special about this book was how Meyer made us sweat for information. She keeps us guessing, confused, but not in a bad way in my opinion. And I felt she very much intended to get us all confused. Meyer doesn't explain most of the time - she shows, over the course of the entire book. She lets us see for ourselves, understand without saying the words specifically. She leaves it up to us to gather the information, trusts us to figure it out through the character's actions, words, memories. And it works. You understood most everything, and what we didn't? I trust she'll explain it, in the future books. Meyer does not seem to be in a rush to show her world to us. PREDICTABILItY Yes, this book is predictable. The reader realizes where the big revelation is headed fairy early on, but I don't think Meyer intents for it to be a big secret. She went for something pretty obvious, but the rest of the book is pretty outstanding. We might not be surprised, and yet we are, in a way. Not by the big bad secrets, but by the entire scenario. The entire world. The entire direction taken here. And there there is that ending... ENDING Dear god, what a cliffhanger! Is that seriously where the book ends?! I spoiled it for myself half way though when I went to check when Scarlet comes out, and I don't think I would've seen it coming (I'm not talking about the big secret. I'm talking about what happens to Cinder) without it. It didn't make me any less surprised and anxious to read the ending, though. And now I have to wait. Until 2013. It's only 4 months away. 4... months... I'm going to die.",Nitzan Schwarz
9780141340135,"Reason for Reading: Upon reading the summary, I knew this book was for me as it had everything I'd love in a YA novel: fairytale retelling, sci-fi, cyborg, and dystopia. I had planned not to start any new series this year but I didn't know this was the start of a series until I started to read the book. This was fabulous! I have to admit that when it really boils down to it I do much prefer science fiction to fantasy, and yet I don't read nearly as much of it. This hit the spot perfectly. A fairytale retelling that goes far beyond the scope of the original fairytale. Meyer has managed to hold onto the basic characters and some major events while throwing the familiar plot out the window to bring us a new version of Cinderella that had me glued to my seat and turning pages almost faster than I could read. Cinder is the dominant character in this book and one fantastic female lead who carries the plot all on her own. I took to her character right away and found her to be very well-written, with genuine feelings and emotion. She is a person who stays true to her own nature no matter how it will affect appearances sake. I also found the dystopian world intriguing. Set in some unknown future, a century after World War IV, the world has changed its political divisions and ruling systems, is different in many ways and yet not so much that it is still a believable possible reality. The book ends looking forwards to the sequel and yet has a satisfying ending for the book in hand. Something I appreciate in series books. One of my favourite reads this year.",Nicola Mansfield
9780141340135,"After all of the hype that Cinder has received in the past couple of months, I was so happy to finally have a copy in my hands! I loved both the cover and the premise and, thankfully, it certainly lived up to my expectations. This is a retelling of the classic Cinderella, and it is very loosely based around the idea with some parallels. The book starts with a quote from the original version, but we can tell that this is a very different setting and story from the first paragraph. This story is set in New Beijing, which I thought was original and effective. Often a lot of Young Adult books are set in America or England, so this was a refreshing change. It was interesting to have a story set in a very different cultural background and to see the different aspects of society. We are also introduced to the Lunars - a very interesting society, based on the moon and led by the power-hungry Queen Levana, who is very hostile towards the Earthen. There was also some mentions of 'Princess Winter' of Luna, who I believe we will be seeing in the last novel of this series - and I can't wait! Cinder, as our main character, was fantastic. I really loved reading about her and she was fantastically formed. Cinder is a cyborg and a mechanic. She is not a 'girly girl' - most of the time she is walking around in her combat trousers which are covered in oil and grease. She is certainly her own person, with a strong determined personality which isn't easily swayed by others. She had a very real attitude, which is what I loved about her. Of course, she had an evil stepmother called Adri and whom I really disliked, but liked as a villain - she was cruel and spiteful. I actually didn't mind one of her step-sisters, Peony, as their relationship did change and was quite sentimental at points. However, her other was a great reflection of her mother, with a very cruel streak to her. Prince Kai was our second prominent character in this novel, and I can see why he had such a fan base! From the very first encounter we had with him, he was a likeable character. He didn't give much away and he was very intriguing. Although he is a handsome prince, Kai is not perfect and this is why he is so loveable. He is realistic in his emotions - he gets scared, but he also has confidence and can be brave. The romance between Cinder and Prince Kai was not instant, but the chemistry built throughout the book, which I really enjoyed. There was also quite some subtle humour thrown in by Kai, which lightened the tone of the story. The whole sci-fi aspect of this book was fascinating. There were some great descriptions of mechanics, especially when considering androids - robots which worked with and around the people of New Beijing. Iko, Cinder's android, confidante and friend was very fun to read about and it was surprisingly easy to build an emotional connection to her, even if she was completely made of metal. A lot of morality issues are discussed in this book and a lot of questions regard personality versus body or shell. Cyborgs and androids are classed as second class citizens in this new world. Cinder discovers more about herself as the novel progresses and faces a lot of internal battles. There was, somewhat, a sense of mystery to this novel, but unfortunately I found it to be quite predictable and knew what the outcome was going to be around the first quarter of this novel. However, it was still interesting to see how things unfolded and how facts were brought together. The ending was quite a cliffhanger which was disappointing to me as things weren't completely resolved. It's not very clear whether this will be resolved in the next novel, as I believe it focuses on a different character, but I'd like to hope there will be some sort of closure to the story. Overall, whilst this novel wasn't completely perfect, it was interesting and engaging. I loved the idea of it and thought that the execution was well done. I never thought that a book that was so heavily based around androids and cyborgs would capture my attention as well as this one did. With it's feisty heroine, atypical romance and fantastic idea, this is a book that I'd certainly recommend. I can not wait to read the next instalment to see what Meyer has to offer us next!",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9780141340159,"This series just keeps getting better and better, I just love it. Meyer has crafted such a fabulous world in these retellings and with such well-drawn characters that you can't help but to root for them, and to wish they were your friends ... or lover as is the case with captain Thorne. ""Captain, I think I am in love with you"" O captain, my captain, how I love thee. I have loved him since Cinder stumbled upon him in Scarlet, he's such as cocky rapscallion and I love it. I think I must have a thing for scoundrels with hearts of gold or something like that ;-) I enjoyed getting to see a whole new side to him though and learning that he is not just a selfish criminal. Cress is a lovely new addition to the cast, she is such a sweet girl, surprisingly relatable and a lot less crazier than you would expect from someone who has been alone in a satelitte most of her life. She grew a lot during the course of her adventures and I can't wait to see more growth from her in Winter. And Iko, can someone please get me my own Iko already, thank you. I love how she has no brain/mouth filter and just says what's on her mind, usually it is the same thing that is on the readers mind. Iko is definitely my favourite character and I hope she gets and keeps that perfect humanoid body of her dreams by the end of the chronicles. I love how the plot builds and builds with each book, and Cress had many great new developments that I can't wait to see fleshed out in the next book. And that book cannot come out soon enough, it is going to be so good. @ natheartsbooks.blogspot.co.uk",Natalie Johnson
9780141340234,"As much as I loved ""Cinder,"" I love ""Scarlet"" at least as much and maybe even more! When it comes to young adult fantasies/fairy tales, I cannot recommend these books highly enough. marissa Meyer is an absolute masterful storyteller, and her books are completely free of two things--profanity and sex. For me, this is the most refreshing part of this book. It is over 400 pages of almost nonstop action with somewhat familiar characters told in a post-modern setting. Yes, there is some violence, but none of the descriptions make me recoil. My daughter is almost ten, and this is the first truly young adult series that I would be comfortable with her reading. One of the things that amazes me is that Marissa Meyer actually makes me like her fantasy books. i am one who generally does not like fantasy books, but once in a while, I find one I like. And this series is definitely a keeper. She explains things so that they somehow logically make sense. And the links between the various characters are absolutely incredible. One more thing--don't expect an ending that ties up all the loose ends. Just like she did with ""Cinder,"" she has left you somewhat hanging. This is a book that I recommend you start with caution (but please read ""Cinder"" first) because once you start it, you won't want to stop! I won this book, and I reviewed it because I wanted to. No one asked me to review it, and all opinions are 100 percent mine.",Ruth Hill
9780141340234,"Warning: There may be spoilers for Cinder as this is the second book in a series and it picks up right where Cinder left off. Scarlet Benoit's Grandmother is missing and no one but Scarlet seems to want to do a thing to find her. When her father stumbles into her farmhouse claiming that he was kidnapped and tortured by some people who are tattooed with a similar tattoo that she noticed on a street fighter named Wolf earlier that day, Scarlet begrudgingly seeks Wolf's help, but there is something that is just a little too animalistic and unsettling about him. Meanwhile Cinder is escaping from prison and ends up enlisting the help of 'Captain' Thorne. Installing Iko's personality chip into a barely working spaceship they leave earth and plan what to do next. Cinder knows she should go to Africa, but she is still reluctant to accept her role as princess. I was wary starting Scarlet, as I didn't want to leave Cinder and Kai's story behind to start on a new one about new people. I was worried that Scarlet's story would mean Cinder would only pop up at the very end, however straight away those fears were quashed. Cinder is very much still a main character in this novel and it follows her as she struggles to deal with the fallout of the ball and everything that happened to her only days before. Through Cinder we are introduced to a new character, Thorne, who seems to be in this novel mainly for some much needed comic relief and a way to get Cinder Our of New Beijing however, I believe his role in this series will become more important in Cress. Scarlet is very different from Cinder, that much is clear from the get go, while Cinder is a mechanic who very much wants to remain hidden and lets other people deal with their own problems Scarlet is an outspoken young farmer who knows how to handle a gun and isn't afraid to get into a fight. I know some people had issues with Scarlet's character but I liked her bad attitude and tough persona. One thing I greatly appreciate with this series is Meyer's determination to make the women in it much more than the damsel in distress. They fight their own battles and do job's that are not regularly occupied by women; Cinder is a mechanic, Scarlet is a farmer, and while yes Cress is a prisoner she's also a hacker. They are not your typical fairytale heroins. The Romance in this novel is also different from the slow burn and sweet glances between Cinder and Kai. It's not much of a spoiler to say that Scarlet and Wolf are the love interests this time round and their chemistry is like an explosion, not a spark. Both their personalities can be a mixture of sweet and volatile, meaning that even though they only known each other a short amount of time they spend so much of it in tight corners that their whirlwind romance is understandable. As with Cinder I didn't find any of the 'twists' to be anything but predictable but unlike Cinder I didn't feel that the 'big reveals' were the epicentre of the plot and therefore I didn't feel frustrated that the characters hadn't realised it, or that the author wasn't doing enough to cleverly conceal it so I wasn't as bothered. I loved this story, however the reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was because I felt like Meyer wrote too many indecisions in to keep the series going for longer. If Cinder had just let Kai know that she was really the Lunar Princess then they could have kick started a rebellion, but instead I feel like that's being drawn out until the next novel just so that Meyer can write a series of 4 retelling and drag it out for longer than needs be. It's arguable that we might miss some characters etc... so I'm on the fence as to whether or not it's pointless to do so but I still think it was a bit of an obvious attempt to keep the series going. However it's faults does not distract from it's overall positives.",Iona
9780141340234,"This book has NO ""negative"" reviews! Now I have to be the weirdo. This review will have spoilers about Cinder, so don't read on if you don't want to know. I hoped Scarlet would redeem the series for me since I was one of the few people who wasn't a fan of Cinder. While I know why Marissa Meyer set Cinder in China (because the tale of Cinderella originated there,) the way she handled the culture was a complete mess, and greatly hindered my enjoyment throughout the novel. Thank goodness, I only had to bear Meyer's misuse of Chinese honorifics in one scene in Scarlet. Scarlet, on the other hand, is largely set in France--a country I have no experience/associations with and therefore would not notice if there were cultural discrepancies. I was right, Scarlet annoyed me a lot less than Cinder did, but still a book I would hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend. Juvenile Writing, Tackling Uneasy Subjects and Relationships: This is more of a personal gripe. I just checked Amazon, and apparently Scarlet is targeted towards ages 12 and up (I always thought the book was targeted towards 16 and up, oops!,) so I guess the lengthy writing that often made me feel like Meyer is underestimating her readers is suitable after all. There is a scene were the author suggests a one night stand (okay, maybe it was a one week stand, but that's not that much better) and also the brief suggestion of rape in another. Being that the age level is twelve, I see why these topics are glossed over, but it also makes me feel like the author is not confident enough to tackle these issues despite throwing them in. Queen Levana: GIMMIE THE BACKSTORY!: I know I am supposed to hate Levana, but I had problems finding a reason to hate her. I get that she wants world domination--and that's always bad--but I wanted to find out WHY she wanted so many people to love her. Was she bullied? A social outcast? World domination is not easy. Not sure why she has to marry Kai either. Why not just kill him and win world domination through conquest? But I just imagine her as a desperate cougar. I would personally spend my time reading than ruling the world. Cinder tries to make her hateful by describing her burn wounds as a baby, but I felt that was too forced. If her orchestrating the mutation of her people into werewolves and the destruction of thousands of lives didn't make me hate her, a baby getting burned won't miraculously do the trick. If Cinder's stepmother made me feel for her, despite her ""evilness"" (which I felt was one of the brighter moments in Cinder,) Queen Levana should have a fleshed out story as well. Maybe her story is revealed in the novella? I certainly hope so. Cinder, Poor Girl Gets Overshadowed: I like Cinder and Scarlet equally, they both have their strengths, but also can be too oblivious or have anger issues. While reading the story, I felt much more invested in Scarlet's character and Cinder quickly became overshadowed. I also felt Cinder became less appealing, not only because she was overshadowed, but because everything became too convenient with her new Lunar powers. Now not only did she have cyborg powers of quick problem solving and the ability to fix hardware by connecting them to her...head? but also mind-control AND the ability to make spaceships undetectable. It felt like every time the author hit a plot hole, she ""solved"" it by giving Lunars a new ability. ""Oh shoot, how is Cinder going to break out of prison? Eh, she can just mind control the guard with her Lunar gift! Oh shoot, how is Cinder going to travel undetected in a gigantic spaceship? Um, well Lunars have the ability to do that too! Oh no, Cinder is stuck in a crowd, how will she get out of it? That's easy! Her Lunar gift can change her appearance to disguise her from everyone!"" What can this girl NOT do? And how much of it is actually attributed to her as a person...and not because she has the ability to download and process manuals from the Internet. Suddenly, it felt like Cinder became invincible. Her ""let's connect electronics to my cyborg brain"" thing made her even harder to relate to. Cinder & Kai: I was okay with Cinder & Kai's relationship in Cinder--even though Kai didn't have much of a personality aside from being handsome (he also has way too much time on his hands for being the leader of the entire Eastern Commonwealth.) In Cinder, he struck me as a very poor leader, spending his time being angry, relying on his advisors, not showing up on time to state meetings, and hitting on a girl. Kai really got the short end of the stick in Scarlet, in the few scenes he does appear in, he only serves as background details to the plot. He still has yet to win me over. I wonder how Kai and Cinder relationship will work out, precisely, how Kai will react when he finds out Cinder's true identity as Princess Selene. Will he be jumping for joy? And how will he convince Cinder to be with him without being a jerk that's like ""I know you are the princess, so let's marry and everything will be fine and dandy! And let's ignore the whole part about locking you up in prison, doubting you, and stuff."" It's going to be sappy. I can just feel it. Scarlet & Wolf, Echoes of Twilight/A Discovery of Witches: Not instalove, but dangerously close. Their relationship progressed in the way that romance novels do: the characters don't trust one another and there's some tension, but then they suddenly realize that they are made for one another. How fast their relationship gave me this schadenfreude feeling. I didn't want it to be THAT easy. I WANTED THEM NOT TO WORK OUT. I am evil like that. And because I thought Scarlet did not deserve Wolf. Seriously, that girl has some anger issues. When Wolf comments on her scent, she immediately snaps at him, telling him it's none of his business. That is NOT how you treat a guy who is willing to help you track down your missing grandmother. There's a difference between being a badass and being rude and ungrateful. I admit, there were some sweet moments, but when I got to the end, their relationship made me wince. I felt Wolf had more development than Kai though, so I did root for him. But there was a point where I just felt bad for him because Scarlet was just--mean. I could just picture him being that wounded dog thrown out into the rain. And then came the Twilight echoes. Scarlet was made to be this independent, strong-willed girl, but then she still depended so much on Wolf to save the day. There are moments when she overestimates herself, kind of like Diana from A Discovery of Witches. And then Wolf had the whole ""I am too dangerous for you! You have no idea how close I was to harming you..."" thing. Ugh. Blending Fairytale with Sci-fi: I appreciate how Meyer weaved sci-fi and fairy tales together. The fairy tale elements are often in the background, while the characters have a life of their own. There was a moment, when Scene ran onto a stage in an opera house that was supposed to be a ""forest,"" that struck me as heavy handed and unnecessary. Perhaps it was especially annoying because she was supposed to be in great danger, yet the author still makes her run through a stupid cardboard ""forest"" for the sake of tying it into the fairytale. Oh, poor Scarlet! Addressing Plot-Holes: THOSE ID CHIPS The id-chips left me with a lot of questions in Cinder: how did these id-chip stealing androids get placed in a government facility? Is this a conspiracy? And I am glad Meyer addressed them. Somewhat. I still felt it could have been better handled. Apparently the general public CARE about those chips, and would riot if they knew it was stolen, because it's VERY important to the family--or so it is said. Which is a surprise, because nobody seems to care enough to claim it after their loved one's death. Or even notice its disappearance. ID-chips causing a riot? I doubt it. Overall, I felt Scarlet was slightly stronger than Cinder due to more character development in the new characters, though it also had quite a few flaws that made Scarlet a slow read for me. Scarlet has the same fast-paced, action-packed, sci-fi and loose fairytale qualities I enjoyed in Cinder though. It's a pity that Cinder and Kai recede into the background, which makes me scared that the next books will do the same thing and introduce more new characters at the expense of the old. If you loved Cinder, I am certainly you will love Scarlet. Just be prepared not to see Kai or Cinder too much. As for me, although I was not impressed with the series thus far, each book for slightly different reasons, I know I will probably still read the next book, hoping it will change my mind. I am determined to like this series!",Lilian (A Novel Toybox)
9780141340234,"I LOVE THIS SERIES!!! If you haven't read Cinder you need to because this is an epic series. Now that we're in to book 2 there was a lot more action. It was nonstop! Scarlet (red riding hood) was looking for her grandmother who'd gone missing. The authorities had given up the search claiming a suicide/runaway, but Scarlet couldn't believe that. She found a guy named Wolf that could possibly help her. They went on a wild adventure trying to keep from getting caught or killed as they searched for answers to the disappearance. Scarlet was feisty with a temper and stood up for others, a great addition to the cast. Don't worry, there was plenty of Cinder and Kai in the story too. The Point of View switched between Scarlet, Cinder, Kai, and sometimes Wolf and Thorne. Thorne was pretty hilarious by the way. I won't tell you about him so you can find out for yourself. I didn't get bored when the POV switched because I loved all the characters and want to know what was going on with each of them.

9780141340234,"Fairytales in the future, fairytales in space. If you haven't read Cinder yet, pick it up and give it a whirl. Scarlet is a new character to the series, but there is still plenty about Cinder in this one. Even my favorite robot personality is back. As the first one resembled Cinderella, this one favors Little Red Riding Hood. There is of course the necessary ""big, bad wolf"", who is definitely big and bad, but in Wolf's own special way - so he's got you questioning everything. Yep, there is a grandmother in this one as well. So there are familiar parts to the Little Red Riding Hood story, but this is not the story from your childhood. This is a re-imagined world where the girls aren't damsels in distress, but are kicking butt and taking names. Marissa Meyer has a way with weaving an old, simple tale into something sci-fi, romantic, and action packed all at the same time. And she does it keeping the characters interesting and the story fresh. There is a political drama weaved into the story, it's actually the glue that is holding all of these characters together and giving them something to fight for.

9780141344454,"THE RISE OF NINE is action-packed and fast-paced. This book isn't perfect but it made me think, happy and annoyed. I still enjoyed reading it, it kept me sit at the edges at times. This was the first book I read from The Lorien Legacies, I haven't read the novellas, I haven't read the prequels, I haven't even seen the movie, but since I thought it was the last and the movie was just so famous, I need to read it ASAP. But as it turned out, this isn't the end and from what I heard, there's still the fourth,fifth, sixth book, maybe even up to nine **sigh** The Summary: Six, Seven, Ten and her Cepan, Crayton flew to India to find another member of the Garde. There they met Eight, who had been training his legacies and living without his cepan. Four and Nine had just excaped from the Mogadorians and the US Government. Four constantly thinks about Sam and Sarah. Nine constantly reminds him that they are here to train and protect the earth and Lorien. In between reuniting with the members, each group faced threats, mysteries, self-discoveries, answers and more questions. THE PROS: In this book, we see more on the character development and discovery. The Garde's members discover themselves, their abilities, their chest, their past. Also, some of the mysteries are solved ( I wonder what will the other books' conflicts are). The charntacters have different strengths and flaws, most of them I loved. There's action, random action in the book. It's also intense and well-defined. The differe POV's have different depths, different voices, you'll know when it change. I love the twists at the end ( especially what happened with eight :)) Nine and Eight save the book. (Nine is hilarious, hot and has some sense, Eight is hot, powerful, light and friendly) IN THE MIDDLE: The whole series has a lot of things going on, there are numerous subplots, backstories, conflicts and protagonists. It's an interesting mix of characters but it also lead to some of them being just shadows. The end doesn't leave in a cliffhanger. The writing is okay, once you get settled reading. THE CONS: There are some boring parts, well, mostly the first chapters. I feel like there's nothing really happening. The story felt stagnant, it really doesn't move anywhere. The author tried to do romance, but it's not good. He tried doing love triangles (six, seven, eight), but only one of them knew that there is such thing. The pairings are complex. (Six likes four, four isn't sure about Sarah because of six, nine shows interest to six, six has some bond with eight, seven hates six for being too close with eight, then eight suddenly loves seven and seven's happy). I don't want eight to end up with seven ( and really, what's up with that kiss, it's random, no one expects it, it felt pushed, just so seven would feel better) I'm gonna read I AM NUMBER FOUR first to know for myself how good it is. I'm gonna read the next books in this series, because I'd like to know who carries Pittacus Lore's power (eight claim it, four claim it, and six has a msyterious voice calling to her) and really I just wanna know how this would end.

9780062085573,"Inevitable spoilers for Shatter Me and Unravel Me. Spoiler Free for Ignite Me though! I wanted to read Ignite Me, because I have loved the books in the series (minus not being thrilled about the last novella) and I had to know what would happen in this dark world where nothing is quite as it seems. There is a love triangle that I am crazy for and I don't even know how I want it to end. My thoughts towards both have changed since I first met them and I usually have a gut feeling who will win out even if that is not the guy that I like the most. Warner has revealed so much about himself that I never would have guessed, showing he has a heart and the depths of his feelings for Juliette are great and that his actions have been carefully planned to try to win her heart and do things for the sector. Adam, I always just liked but despite their physical attraction and their past together, I just am torn because they have both changed so much since then and that really changes their dynamic. Plus of what I read in his novella, it really made me sad some of the thoughts and ways he viewed her and besides she makes a statement in this one that confirms another nagging suspicion I had. They are now on a more even playing field and I feel like they have had their books to shine, and I just need to know who will earn her heart and what will become of the other. So, not only did I want resolution for the love triangle that has stolen my heart, I also wanted to see further character development in Juliette and see how she steps up to be a key in peace and a better life in this dark world. Pretty quickly we get into the story and seeing some of this growth in Juliette. While she is torn apart and grieving over the losses, she sees this healing and second chance at life in a new way, with determination. She isn't sure if her friends are alive and she is still wavering on Warner, which is understandable because while he has revealed some and they have had some pretty intense and hot moments together, she hasn't been inside his head quite like we have, and there were still lots of dark choices he's had to make. I loved the conversations they had together and just seeing how softened he gets toward Juliette and when he loses his composure and we glimpse through the facades. We do get an answer about whether or not her friends are alive. We also get lots of insight into them in unexpected ways. Through Juliette we discover how heavy Kenji's burdens were with being the funny one, having to really shoulder his grief in different ways. We see the ruins of Omega, and know that it meant even if Adam and some others lived through it, then there were still great losses. I don't know if I have just completely gotten used to the style and there is also the fact that we aren't really experiencing things through Juliette's writing. But the writing and the way Juliette's mind works is really still just so poetic and beautiful to me. It is unlike anything I have read really and it makes the books extra special. I am glad that it is still there even if not as shocking as book one with the setup. And of course, Juliette makes a choice for which guy in this book, and with all of the work up to it, I agree with her so much. It ends up being the best decision for her, and the one that spurs her on to do what she needs to do to help bring down the reestablishment and make changes for a better world. It is someone who proves he sees her heart, believes in her, and has the love and support for her. There was a lot of action towards the end as well as some surprise characters that made life even more difficult for Juliette and crew. She had to make some hard choices along the way, but watching her learn her strength and how to not only be stronger for herself but for others was amazing to watch. She had more help learning to master her powers and how to use them in order to gain control and to take down Anderson. Ms. Mafi also manages to break up the tension and weight of their mission by some awesomely swoony scenes. One of the best YA scenes that while it eventually faded to black, it had me sweating and sighing, wishing I was Juliette in that moment. She also manages to write in some hilarious scenes that had me snorting and literally laughing out loud as I read. I did not want to put down this book, and I am wholly satisfied with this conclusion to this series that has captured my attention and my heart. Tahereh Mafi has a bold writing style and she took some risky moves in these books that paid off, and made me love and remember them even more than I thought possible. I think that the threads were tied off well, and that we have closure on the series, though I do think that it could have been well served with a bit of an epilogue, seeing a glimpse of Juliette's triumph and how the world begins to change into something better, and also a glimpse into the one not chosen to see how that works for him. But otherwise, perfection in hundreds of pages. I despised every moment I had to put the book down, and I am left with a Juliette and crew sized hole in my heart because I will miss these characters and their amazingly awesomeness. Bottom Line: F*ing awesome series conclusion. Brave, addictive, hot, and full of action, character growth and resolution.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

No I donC/??t think so but it was still a brilliant sequel! I give this book 4/5 stars! One thing I will never get over is Tahereh MafiC/??s writing style. It is literally the most beautiful style IC/??ve ever read! ItC/??s just so lyrical and poetic, utterly memorizing. I think this book wad definitely better written than the first and itC/??s a joy to watch Tahereh MafiC/??s writing go from strength to strength! The plot for this book was very fast paced. There were a lot of action scenes and there was also a lot of discoveries made. A couple of the plot twists, I saw coming but there were a few that were a complete surprise to me! The ending was not a cliffhanger thankfully but it successfully set up for the final installment in this trilogy! As for the characters, Juliette and Adam were the reason that stopped me from rating this book a 5/5. Juliette was far too self-pitying in this book, I know she had valid reasons but I find almost every page she was complaining about herself or her future and eventually it started to irritate me! Thankfully nearer the end of the novel, she accepts herself more and I look forward to seeing the C/??newC/?? version of her in the next book. Then thereC/??s Adam who was so melodramatic and attacked like a love sick 13-year-old, he annoyed me in this book and I definitely liked him a lot more in the first book. And then thereC/??s Warner, who grew on me during this book because of all the different sides we saw of him (my favourite was him and the dog) but unlike everyone else, IC/??m not on Team Warner, IC/??m more of Team DonC/??t Know haha! I canC/??t get past some of the things WarnerC/??s done so I donC/??t know if IC/??ll ever end up rooting for him! As for the side characters, I love love love love Kenji. He may be in my favourite fictional characters of all time! There were others I liked such as Brendan, the twins, Castle etc we only saw small pieces of them here and there but I liked them all well enough! I loved hating WarnerC/??s dad, he is literally evil and one of the best dystopian villains ever! Overall this was a great addition to the trilogy and I cannot wait to read the final book!",brookexx
9780062085535,"After being blown away by SHATTER ME, UNRAVEL ME had to live up to the very unique and excellent reading experience Tahereh's debut offered. I'm afraid this sequel didn't overwhelm me quite like the first book. For instance UNRAVEL ME didn't hold the original appeal Tahereh Mafi conjured by making Juliette untouchable in the first place. She isn't entirely inapproachable anymore, so some of this forbidden allure relationships between Juliette and Adam as Juliette and Warner held simply evaporated in the second book. Where things felt almost one hundred percent unpredictable in the first book, they appeared more pre-determined now, Juliette has an idea of what's happening around her and knows what's ahead of her, at least for a few days. In SHATTER ME Juliette was captured, in a prison cell, not knowing what her near feature would hold. Now she's living with a group of specially gifted people who are like her. Much of UNRAVEL ME is about explaining who they and what their talents are, what they are doing as an organization of resistance and exploring their group dynamics. New as old characters were all really great in their own ways and their capacity to infuriate or fascinate you. Adam and Warner continue to compete for Juliette's heart and all Warner fans will get their money's worth, because we learn a lot more about his past and what's on his mind. I admit, he grew a lot on me and I felt acutal sympathy for him - quite a sensation remembering what a monster he acted like in SHATTER ME. What really bothered me were Adam and Juliette distancing themselves from each other, because it could be too dangerous for them to be together.Yawn! I thought we'd already overcome that hurdle. No more of this old game in book three, please! 4,5/5 ****/* UNRAVEL ME - A satisfactory second book in a series with minor romantic deficiencies! Tahereh's language is as beautiful and poetical as always, still Juliette lost a little bit of her sometimes strange and always unique voice that was only hers. Yet there's sure enough action and love to make every reader happy. And the evolvement of Warner's character is a definite and strong plus!",MissPageTurner
9780062085535,"After my excitement for this series had been rekindled by Destroy Me, I was really looking forward to Unravel Me. I was sure my dislike of Shatter Me was a situational thing; I must have disliked it because of the headspace I was in when I read it! And then I realized it wasn't Unravel Me per se that I disliked, but it's heroine; it's pathetically whiney, dependent and frail heroine who showed no little growth since Shatter Me. Before I get into all of the reasons why Juliette has ruined this series for me, I would like to comment on the one thing things I did enjoy in Unravel Me. With its stream of consciousness narration, Unravel Me manages to succeed at being incredibly fast-paced, even though almost nothing is happening during its 400+ pages. I will admit to skimming over most of Juliette's angsty monologues about feeling inadequate, which means I probably skimmed over most of Unravel Me, but thanks to almost nonexistent punctuation in between Juliettes' thoughts, Unravel Me reads surprisingly quickly for its lengthier size. Mafi's prose, while definitely of the purple nature, is also quite pretty even though it rarely makes sense. ""It's the kind of kiss that makes you realize oxygen is overrated."" This is where I almost put the book down. I should have known then, but I was promised a world of delights if I read through until Chapter 62, so I persevered. As for Juliette, I'm going to quote from my review of Shatter Me, since it seems appropriate here: ""For the vast majority of the book, she spends her time crying/trembling/gasping/blushing, all while adamantly refusing to understand how anyone, but especially Adam, could care for her. This type of behaviour I could have forgiven, had she shown any growth. But it wasn't until the last few chapters that she went from being a weak, ridiculously melodramatic and frustratingly insecure protagonist into one with the glimmer of something resembling strength."" It's surprising that I could have written that without my quotation marks, you wouldn't have known it had come from a review of a different book! Juliette has seen absolutely no growth since Shatter Me; the description I posted above is equally as fitting in Unravel Me. You know how I know Juliette is supposed to have grown? Because she tells me so! ""I've come to realize that being away from him has forced me to rely on myself. To allow myself to be scared and to find my own way through it. I've had to train without him, fight without him, face Warner and Anderson and the chaos of my mind all without him by my side. And I feel different now. I feel stronger since putting space between us. And I don't know what that means. All I know is that it'll never be safe for me to rely on someone else again, to need constant reassurance of who I am and who I might someday be. I can love him, but I can't depend on him to be my backbone. I can't be my own person if I constantly require someone else to hold me together."" But guess what she was doing ten pages previous to this enlightenment? Sobbing on her knees, trembling in fright, and relying on someone else to pick her up. I understand that Juliette had a tough childhood. I understand that she was tortured at a young age and that there will be psychological repercussions because of it. I understand that this might lead to moments of confusion/angst/self-pity/etc. But understanding and believing are two different things. I didn't believe that Juliette was acting out of some deep psychological torment when she played mind games with both Adam and Warner. I didn't believe that Juliette thought herself a monster, and that was the reason she was so afraid to learn how to control her abilities. And I didn't believe in her inner strength because every time she was pushed, she fell to the ground, crying. As for chapter 62, I was too distracted by Juliette's complete and utter betrayal to enjoy any of it.",Pretty Little Reader
9780062085535,"When the synopsis says that she has to make some hard choices, it is not exaggerating I thought it was just being fancy, but she is faced with a twist that I didn't see coming. And it makes her have to make choices about love that can kill, or breaking her own heart... and his? I love the first book, and the second doesn't disappoint. We get to see more about Omega Point, and we get more of Kenji, who quickly became one of my favorite secondary characters. In Unravel Me, we see more of the day to day operations and Castle's research. The action is well written and the character development is superb. Juliette learns so much about herself and about stepping up, but she of course is still not perfect. She makes some mistakes that hurt to read about, and she literally couldn't make some of her decisions without hurting someone. Besides the above mentioned twist, there are others that left me reeling. I finally began to see the appeal of Warner to an extent (this part of the review was written before I read Destroy Me) but I still go a little crazy for Adam He makes me happy just how much he adores her and how loyal he is to his family and what he believes in. Speaking of his family--James has grown up a little in this one and he is one of my fave characters besides the obvious choices. Although I still think that Adam is the best for Juliette, I know that between what I have learned in this and Destroy Me, that I don't want Warner to get hurt. I don't know how that is going to happen, but I know I don't want it. Where Shatter Me was Adam's book, and it made me love him, and it seems like the main character always picks the first love, Unravel Me is Warner's book. We get to see more of that deep, emotional and scarred side of him. And we see more connection with Warner, because Juliette is afraid of hurting Adam. My mind doesn't even know what to think, and that is good writing when I can't make up my mind. As usual, the pacing is great. There is always some sort of action going on, whether battles or character development. Or some scenes that will break your heart, or make you sigh because of the romance. The sequel is hot and I absolutely can't wait for the third. Bottom Line: Awesome sequel, enjoyed Juliette even more in this one!",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

9780062085481,"Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi is probably one of the most beautifully written books that I have ever read. I also almost gave up on it completely after about 10% of it. Kate Simses, the narrator, was definitely Shatter Me's saving grace. Since I listened to the audiobook, I think it changed the reading experience. (I cannot tell you if it was for better or worse.) For one, I missed out on the scratching out of phrases except for the brief ripping sounds in the audiobook. Honestly, I thought it was skipping at first. It was more annoying than effective. As for the flowery descriptiveness, I would have probably skimmed through most of that. Mafi used strings of similes and metaphors to say the simplest things. It was the most lovely overkill that I've ever experienced. It was torturous to sit through, being as it was used mostly to illustrate the hormonal explosions happening with Juliette. I have read borderline erotica that did not have heroines so needy and starved for human touch as that girl. Granted, she had spent nearly a year in solitary confinement at an insane asylum. That lusty desperation overshadowed the majority of the novel. Juliette was either pining over Adam, the boy thrown in the cell with her at the start of the novel, or waxing poetic about Warner, the twisted leader of the sector. I know that she hated Warner, but she infused much of that hatred with flowery descriptions of his hotness. Say what you will about me, but I will forever refer to this novel as The Passionate, Desperate Ramblings of a Lonely, ***** Teenager from this day forth. As for the characters themselves, I did not find myself really liking, hating, or even feeling sympathetic to any of them. Juliette was a [very weak person who let herself be defeated by her circumstances] young girl who has gone through a lot. She wallowed, nay luxuriated, in self-hatred because of her ability and did not really think of herself as a worthwhile human being deserving to be treated as one until Adam began showing affection toward her. That [pissed me off that she required a male for her own happiness] made me very sad. As for Adam, he mislead her from the start, and I kept waiting for him to pull a trick out of his hat. That is not a good way to start a romance. Warner is a twisted, mean *******, but he never tried to be anything but that. Juliette always knew where she stood with him and what he was capable of, whether she liked it or not. James was probably the only character I came remotely close to liking, but he did not come along until much later in the book. Unfortunately, he is very much a secondary character, and I don't see him progressing into much more than a cute kid on the sidelines. The setting of the novel itself was interesting, but not enough to really redeem the book. The world was changed, causing death of animals, plants, and nearly humanity. A group called the Reestablishment took over the government and was trying to save what it could of the people around the world. The Passionate, Desperate Ramblings of a Lonely, ***** Teenager... Err... I mean Shatter Me is a dystopian, so the Reestablishment was, of course, portrayed as EeeeVille. Realistically, when times are tough, people get hard. Look at the Middle Ages. The whole concept was interesting, but nothing new. The setting was also used to get a bit preachy about environmentalism. It would be unfair of me to at least not mention that the book picked up at the end, but it was too little too late. Juliette does put a damper on those raging hormones and becomes a tad bit more interesting, but it's in the last chapters. There is finally talk of the powers Juliette and others have developed, but it's really nothing new. *coughs* X-Men *coughs* I have hopes that she'll stay remotely interesting in the later books in the series, but I don't know if Ill stick with it to see. [The Passionate, Desperate Ramblings of a Lonely, ***** Teenager] Shatter Me is a beautifully written [hot mess] young adult novel that I bet teenagers are loving everywhere. I even have adult readers that I'm looking forward to giving the book to at the library because I know they'll love it. However, [The Passionate, Desperate Ramblings of a Lonely, ***** Teenager] Shatter Me is most assuredly not for me.",Kayla Beck
9780062085481,"The writing style is very unique and it almost deterred me. It is journal style, almost prose, but not quite, but I am glad that I stuck with it because I was soon enamored by Juliette The prison that she is in, and the mysteries of her past quickly had me soaking it in and flipping through the pages, annoyed any time the outside world interrupted. Soon enough, another character, Adam is introduced, and there is also questions that arise about his character. Did she know him in the past? Does he just look like someone she knew? Is her fear from something she did, or is it something he did to her? But we also see glimpses of his softer side through the tough exterior, and that makes him appealing to me. When Warner comes on the scene, I don't know what to think of him, because I had read some reviews that talked about Team Warner vs Team Adam and I kept waiting for what made people attracted to him. Then I also saw peeks of his pain and what he has been through, and the similarities he had to Juliette, but then some of the things that he did made me second guess anything I though I saw. But about half way through some things come up to make me question Adam! So, Mafi has a talent for twists, and making me on the edge of my seat questioning motives, and what was the real or pretended front for the characters. As of right now I am going to have to claim team Adam, he is sexy, sweet, and there is a history with them, and a connection. The world building was okay for me. We learn about it through Adam because Juliette was there for the beginning of the change, but was mostly locked up for it. It is a dark and chilling world. I couldn't believe some of the developments and how Shatter Me left off. I loved every moment, and couldn't wait for the next book. I was mad at my library and wanted Unravel Me to be in my hands the moment I closed the book.

9780062085481,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Oh my God! I finished this book nearly three weeks ago and it was the last book I finished! The book I started after finishing Shatter Me, I haven't been able to finish. I'm still reading it slowly while reading another book that I knew would get me back into the gear of reading because it's a sequel to a book I loved. Anyway, back to the OH MY GOD! This book was amazing. It's taken me so long to write a review of this book because after finished it I was going through so many emotions about it and I didn't know what to say about this book. It's a cross with SO much stuff to say, but all I can do is ramble, to not having anything at all to say because it was THAT good. I'm still having issues with this review. All I can say is my review is going to suck, but this book most definitely does NOT suck. I can't believe I waited so long to read it! I've been dying to FOREVER, but just haven't gotten around to grabbing a copy from the library. I know this will most definitely be one of the next books I order when I do order any books because I want, no NEED, a copy of this sitting on my shelf. 1) The cover is GORGEOUS! & 2) I need access to it 24/7! Mafi's writing style was so awesome! Created vivid scenes in my head. SO vivid I really did get sucked in and thought I was truly living as Juliette. I love how she had Juliette writing in her book and crossing things out. I love how things were crossed out! It was extremely unique and I can say I have never seen that in a book. There probably are a few out there, but I've never come across one. I thought it was weird, but unique, at first. But quickly fell in love! And Juliette's abilities! OMG. It reminds me of Rogue from X-Men, and I LOOOOVE Rogue. I still can't figure out which one is more bad-ass in my head yet. They both come to a close tie. :) And Adam. God. All I can say is: MEGA. FREAKING. AMAZING. HOTTIE! I about died when he entered. He was an ******* at first, but god he's not. Definitely not. He's so sweet and amazing and I totally freaking swooned every time he was in a scene. Overall, there isn't really much I can say. This is an amazing dystopian. I would also kind of say for those of you weird people who don't really dystopians I really do recommend this because it's not JUST dystopian. It has a supernatural element in it with Juliette's unique ability and it's a romance. And boy did I LOOOVE that romance. I can't wait for the sequel. I'm dying a little inside each and every day it doesn't pop into my head. BOO!",Amanda
9780062085481,"originally published in: http://catchthelune.blogspot.com Juliette has magical touch. Whenever anyone touches her bare skin, their life seems to be sucked away from their body. Her parents think that she is dangerous. Her teacher used to make her work alone. She never has the luxury to feel love from another human being. Only fear and isolation. But things happen when people touch me. Strange things. Bad things. Dead things. I can't remember the warmth of any kind of embrace. My arms ache from the inescapable ice of isolation. My own mother couldn't hold me in her arms. My father couldn't warm my frozen hands. I live in a world of nothing. No one ever treats her nicely. No one ever cares. Because she is a monster. Juliette accepts the insult from her schoolmates. She never fights back even though she can. She can be a real monster, but she doesn't want to lose her piece of humanity. Then one accident happens, and suddenly, Juliette is sent away to an institution. I've been locked up for 264 days. I have nothing but a small notebook and a broken pen and the numbers in my head to keep me company. 1 window. 4 walls. 144 square feet of space. 26 letters in an alphabet I haven't spoken in 264 days of isolation. 6,336 hours since I've touched another human being. Juliette has lost hope, and she thought that she will be forever alone in her cell. But suddenly, Adam comes to her life. Adam, the guy who comes in and become her cellmate. Adam, who seems to be genuinely care for her. Adam, the guy who turns out to be a soldier spying on her. Adam, the guy who went to third to ninth grade with her. Adam, the closest thing to a friend she ever had. Adam, who is strangely immune to her touch. Together, they find hope in their shattered life and risk their life to escape from Adam's boss, Warner. Warner wants Juliette and her power. He has horrible plans to use Juliette's power to give him more power. He wants Juliette, and he will never back down. Can Juliette escape from Warner and keep Adam alive in the same time? Will she finally convince herself enough that she may be not a monster? Shatter Me is a wonderful read, and I enjoyed it immensely. The writing is strange yet creative with lines like this to show Juliette's inner thought. Juliette's mind is overflowed with emotion and feelings, so there are a few times you will see line with adjective adjective adjective or verb verb verb without comma or anything to make up with the Grammar police. It becomes a little confusing sometimes. The little question I want to ask about this book is why Juliette doesn't wear glove all the time. The accident happened because she touched the kid with bare hand. If I were Juliette, I would use glove all the time so I won't hurt anyone in coincidence. Aside from the little flaws, I think this book deserves my praise. The first book of this series ends well and I can hardly wait to read the next book. I love the idea of the story! Probably the most favorite thing in this book is Adam and Juliette's relationship. They practically crave each other, and it's so sweet that they already have their eyes set on each other from a very long time. There are many kissing in this book and I must say... they are pretty intense scenes. If you're looking for a great YA book with passionate love relationship and beautiful writing, then you should grab this book! But being around so much love has managed to thaw my frozen parts into something human. I feel human. Like maybe I could be a part of this world. Like maybe I don't have to be a monster. Maybe I'm not a monster. Maybe things can change.",Hilda
9780062085481,"I immediately and excitedly read this one, leaving my to-be-read books on my shelves. I didn't even try to turn my head back or gave the slightest glance on the other books as my eyes had immersed to Juliette's world. I was completely drawn by Juliette since the beginning of the first chapter. Listening to her voice was quite mesmerizing. I kept falling for her words. Mafi had created a character who had the most original voice. She made me think that she wasn't the author of this book and this was Juliette's. And that was one good point in this book. Mafi really made me love Juliette, care for her, cry for her, and just wanted to help her. I too love the other characters in this book. The villain, I would say, was the best. Mafi made an antagonist who wishes to be loved back by the protagonist. One thing which is not so common in most books. And I liked the concept. Though, Mafi had written characters with such mysterious aspects on their personality. I hope in the next books, she gave more emphasis on their characteristics. Another good point is the romance. Mafi knows how to bring her audience to one sizzling, hot drive. When Adam and Juliette are together, all the metals in the world could melt with their undying love with each other. Mafi did gave me questions that need immediate answers. Cliff-hangers could ruin a good book like this but Mafi left me wanting for more of Juliette, her world, and her touch. Overall, this book really did shattered me but not quite the book I'm longing for; yet, this book was amazing, incredible, brilliant, and sexy. All the good adjectives good fit this one! A completely perfect mix of dystopia, paranormal, and romance. Tahereh Mafi is an author to look up to and to watch for. Visit http://mrbookwonder.tumblr.com for more of my reviews.",Kristoff Peralta
9780062085481,"Juliette Ferrars has been locked up in an asylum for 264 days by the Reestablishment. They locked her up because her touch is fatal. She spends her day looking out the one window in her cell. She wonders about rain drops and birds. It has been awhile since she has seen a bird in the skies. She has been alone all that time. Now she is getting a roommate. At first, she is excited to see another human being, but has mixed feelings once she finds out her roommate is male. Adam, that is his name. Juliette has been alone for so long, that it is difficult for her to open up and talk to anyone. At first, she ignores him, but then she helps him out with the things that they do daily in the cell. Juliette cannot help the feeling that she knows Adam from somewhere. She knows his eyes. After a while, soldiers come in and take Juliette and Adam out of the cell. They take Juliette to another place and there she meets Warner. She also learns that Adam's name is Adam Kent, that he is a soldier and can finally place where she knows him. Warner tells her that he wants her on his side in the war. At first, she doesn't understand what he is talking about. When she figures out that he wants her to torture people to get information for his side, she instantly refuses. Warner then shows her the things that she is missing. One of those things is that she gets to go outside, which is exhilarating to Juliette because it is not a dream. Juliette has choices to make and questions to answer. Will she side with Warner and do what he wants her to do? Will she forgive Adam for deceiving her when he first came into the cell? How will she get out of this current predicament and where will she go? My Opinion: This book was very well thought out. There were points in the book that I didn't know what would happen. Not because Juliette was wavering, but the circumstances prevented you from predicting it. I found that I could understand the feelings that Juliette had and the actions she took because of them. There are a few surprises in this book and I won't spoil them for you, but they make the read worth it. I Like: Juliette. She is the main character in this book. Her touch is fatal and so she thinks that she is a monster. It takes a lot of persuasion to get to start thinking otherwise. When she is forced to kill a soldier so Warner can see what she can do, she feels awful about it. She never wants to feel that again. She has been ostracized her whole life because of this strange power that she has. Throughout the book, she learns what it means to have such power and what people will do for it. Adam Kent. He is the boy who is put in the cell with Juliette at the beginning of the book. At first, he is mean to her, but then he softens up. When Juliette finds out that he is a soldier, she believes that she was just a ""job."" Throughout the book, Adam has to keep up appearances and he does it so well sometimes that Juliette doesn't even know which side he is on. James, Adam's brother. You don't meet James until the later part of the story, but he is a neat kid. The strikethrough print. It was interesting to read what Juliette was thinking in contrast to what she said. It was like she was debating on whether to say something or not. I Did Not Like: Warner. He wants Juliette on his team to torture people that he captures in the war. He puts her in situations where she will have to use her power even though she is dead set against. He doesn't want to let Juliette go. He uses fear as a tool and kills people for trivial things. The Reestablishment. You don't hear a whole lot about them in this book, but you do get a sense that they are not the good guys. They were supposed to come in and make things better, but instead they take over and try to rule. Cover: On the cover, there is Juliette dressed in a white gown with her hair down. There are lines coming out of her like she is wielding a secret power. She has her hands on her hips which is symbolic of defiance. The cover reads: My touch is lethal. My touch is power. I like how the cover is shiny. It really makes Juliette stand out on the cover. This fits the description of Juliette well.",Tammi
9781594746031,"First of all, I went into this book with a very different idea of what this book was going to be about. This is my fault because I didn't realize I'd never actually read a summary of the book. I'd heard so much about it, everything about the pictures of course, and thought I knew what to expect. In my mind this book was a creepy, sort of horror book that was set in the past. This resulted in me being a little confused for the first couple of pages because the books starts out in modern Florida. Something that has to be said about this book is that the design is beautiful. I own the paperback version and it's such a sturdy book. The paper feels a lot nicer and is less likely to rip than that of most other books I own. The cover fits the book perfectly and gives it the creepy vibes that attracted me to this book in the first place. Then the book is filled with antique pictures that sometimes give you an image of what a character looks like, and sometimes are just plain creepy. There's a lot of different characters in this novel. From Jacob's best, and only, friend who has green hair to his snobby mother to a kid who is invisible. Jacob himself comes over like a real person and react to the situations in a way that's reasonable and realistic. My favorite characters were definitely the peculiar children because of how they really acted like children. They asked lots of question when they weren't supposed to and used their abilities in ways that weren't always responsible. Sadly we didn't get to know most of them that well so I hope we'll learn more about them in the sequel. Although the main focus of this book is definitely on the plot and the setting it did make me think. These kids are in a loop where they repeat the same day over and over again. Jacob has to decide whether or not he wants to stay. It made me think what I would do in his position. Would I be able to handle going through the same day in the same place again and again, even if I would be happy there? There were two things I didn't really like about the book. The first one isn't that important, but the chapters are huge. There's 352 pages and only 11 chapters. This way I can't be like: ""I'll just read one chapter before doing this or that"". The other thing that made me feel a little awkward was the beginning romance between Jacob and Emma. Everything is all fine until you remember that Emma used to be the girlfriend of Jacob's grandfather... I am pretty sure this book classifies as young adult but to me it felt a lot more like a middle grade book. There's nothing wrong with that because there are tons of middle grade books I love, but if you don't like those kind of books these may not be for you. Because apart from some gruesomely described scenes I don't think there's anything in the book that I would say is too mature for younger readers. All in all I really enjoyed this book and am really curious about what will happen to Jacob and his friends in Hollow City. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and would definitely recommend it. Even if it's just to find out what everyone's been talking about. Side note: I found a reference to John Green's papertowns. ""Left at the multiethnic roof Santas!"" (page 32)",Nina
9781594746031,"When I first went to a bookstore and saw this, I think I stood in front of the book screaming at it, not because I was scared of it, but because I was so happy to see it and it felt like I saw a thing of beauty. The lady at the counter shushed me, so I slid at a corner, but glanced at the copy again and screamed again, and yeah, they kinda wanted to throw me out. Anyway, after quick deliberations, I bought the book and I do not regret anything about it ever since! The photographs used are hauntingly fascinating and you keep on staring at them to get a feel of them, intertwine them fully with the character, and you'd realize how intrigued you are by the characters and eventually intrigued by the real people in the photographs. It's amazing how the photos have so much relevance to a particular scene in the story. You'd think that the book can't avhieve the same type of charm as it did with the photos in it. Ransom is a genius. It takes a lot of great effort to find the right photographs for this story so it would seem. Especially with the wide array of characters, finding the right one to fit their peculiarity, is a task on its own and Ransom was able to deliver by giving us wonderful characters like the beautiful, hot-head Emma, to the charmingly optimistic Olive. The main character Jacob, may have become one of my favorite male protagonist. He's honest, very brave and would never think twice in order to help his friends when they're in danger and his curiousity is a charm. You'd think that you'd be swamped with the number of characters involved in the book, but no! You'd actually look forward to them, and that's what's so beautiful about it. Not only that, Ransom made sure that no one is forgotten. Each character has this specific role that plays well in the situation. No matter how many they were in the picture, they mattered. One other thing about this novel is the play on the past and present; fantasy and reality. Ransom was able to bring us the merge of the present life, with the standstill of the past in the Miss Peregrine's loop. Of course, the fantasy element of the peculiarities of the children, like Enoch's way of bringing the dead back to life for a matter of minutes, or Horace's premonition of the future. Since the past they are living in is set in the time of the Nazi Regime, there are some sort of military references along the way, but still minimal. What is amazing is the peculiar language and the antagonists of the story, the wights and the hollows. Ransom was able to make these horrifying creatures that could possibly haunt you endlessly in your dreams if you think about them too much. And then there are the wights. All too cunning and mischievous, I hate them. Style-wise, Ransom's way of writing isn't at all shocking and is easy on the eyes. You won't exactly need to burn a hundred brain cells to understand. It is comprehensible enough for any young reader or teenager out there! Of course, the terminologies may throw you off sometimes, but there aren't a lot so, you'll be fine. What's amazing is that Ransom was able to embrace the British slang quite well and use it to further make the people of Cairnholm, realistic to the readers. Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a spice of eccentric you need on your bookshelves.",Writer For Misfits
9781594746031,"I could not put this book down, it was exceptionally good! Both the author and the concept of a book based on creepy photographs is new to me, and I can't wait to read more in this genre. I must say, the book does get quite creepy at times, and if you're sensitive like me, you might want to read it during daytime ;) I've already purchased the sequel but am a bit chicken to start reading it, though I absolutely must know what happens next!",Olga
9781594746031,"Miss Peregrines home for peculiar children tells the story of Jacob, a teenager who has grew up listening to his grandfather stories of a mystical island home to children with special powers, who are known as peculiar. All these stories had been exactly that to Jacob until one fateful day when his grandfather is killed by a mysterious creature. This day triggers Jacob to go on a trip to the island of of Wales, an island that holds his grandfathers past and may hold Jacobs future. When beginning this book i was excited as i had read and watched so many reviews that raved how great it was and how they cannot wait for the sequel, well i do not share that opinion. For all the hype it received, it left me stunned as the story was average at best. it didnt draw me in nor did it keep me hooked like a great story does. I found the storyline mostly uneventful, the ending didnt have the wow that i expected it was all rather plain and weird to say the least. This book was nothing of what i expected and is certainly not one i would recommend, I will not be continuing the series as it holds no interest for me and i do feel let down by it as i think it was way over hyped. I hope this review has helped you, can you please rate it positively if you liked it as it really means a lot to me, Many Thanks for reading:)",Sarah Martin
9781594744761,"Let me start by saying that, 1) I think the description of this book is a bit misleading, and 2) When I started reading it, I didn??????????C/??t know that it was the first book in a series. Because of this, I found reading Miss Peregrine??????????C/??s Home for Peculiar Children, well, peculiar. Jacob Portman grew up listening to the fantastic stories his Grandpa told of his youth; Tales of monsters and children with extraordinary talents. No matter how incredible they seemed, he always believed the stories to be true, until the day that he didn??????????C/??t. ??????????C/??We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing them becomes too high.??????????C/?? When tragedy strikes and Jacob happens to witness it, everything he believes is put to the test. Traveling to the place of his Grandpa??????????C/??s past, searching for answers to help ease his mind, Jacob learns that even the tallest of tales are sometimes based on the truth. I genuinely liked this book. Even though it wasn??????????C/??t what I expected due to the somewhat misleading description (I??????????C/??m not going to go into that though because I don??????????C/??t want to spoil anything), I really did like it. Had I known it was the first book in a series, I may have liked it even more. However, having not known that, I found the book to be a bit slow. I enjoyed Jacob??????????C/??s narration and I thought that the use of the vintage photographs to enhance the story was creative and at times disturbing (Hello Creepy Santa, please step away from those kids), but I felt that the story wasn??????????C/??t really going anywhere. It was interesting enough, funny in all the right places, and had a few elements that I didn??????????C/??t really see coming (so kudos for that), I just expected it to be. . . more. More creepy. More sinister. More action packed. But it wasn??????????C/??t. I felt like the story kept building and building, but nothing happened. . . until the last 60 pages or so, that is. The end of the book really picked up some steam and that??????????C/??s what finally reeled me in. Knowing now that the story will go on, I think Miss Peregrine??????????C/??s sets up a good foundation for the next book. The world has been built, the characters have been established, and the plot has thickened. I??????????C/??ll definitely be picking up the sequel when it comes out and I, for one, hope the next leg of their journey is anything but ordinary. ??????????C/??I used to dream about escaping my ordinary life, but my life was never ordinary.

9781594744761,"This book has an excellent beginning! I loved the writing style of the author and felt it easy to read, comfortable and casual. The book, however for me, took a turn I had a hard time following. Although the book started off great and mysterious, the whole business with monsters and wights seemed silly and underdeveloped. I must say, though, the photography was wonderful! I had a great time examining each photo that was described and imagining what life might have been like with these people. Something I've also noticed, as far as the book's physical aspects are, as opposed to it's contents, is that the paper is wonderfully smooth and has a great contrast and thickness to it. I never really gushed over a book's visual and physical aesthetics, but this book was excellent in that category. The book's a quick read (especially with all the photos) so if you're looking for something weird casual read, then by all means pick this up! First Line: ""I had just come to accept that my life would be ordinary when extraordinary things began to happen."" (8) Last Line: ""We rowed faster.""

9781594744761,"This is one book that you can judge by its cover. The cover and dust jacket of this book are stunning, as is, most importantly, the contents. As well as gorgeous white pages and patterned chapter beginnings, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is scattered with genuine, eccentric and very distinctive vintage photographs. These are the real base for the story and it's interesting to see how Riggs managed to link them all together - I can imagine that this would've been a very fun plot to create. A couple of the photographs did feel as though they were forcibly stuck into the story, but I enjoyed looking at them all the same. I think that the chosen word for this book, peculiar, is very apt in all aspects. It is a very quirky and quite a unique book but although it is all so very strange, it feels natural to the story and there is no feeling that the author is trying too hard. There was some slight over description at points, but I never once got bored. I enjoyed sitting back and reading the descriptions of the Welsh island setting and also of all of the characters that Jacob, our protagonist, met. Riggs has a way with making everything feel eerie. There is a sort of fairytale like feeling to the story, but it is twisted and dark. As aforementioned, I never got bored of reading this book - there are enough twists and the action increased as the book progressed. There was not a whole lot of action during the first half of the story but I actually somewhat preferred the discovery of things rather than the fast paced events that took place near the end. I liked Jacob as a protagonist. He was imperfect and he felt real and as rational as anyone could be under his circumstances. We learned a few things about him, personality wise, as he tried to make sense of unanswered questions left to him by his grandfather who was killed. I particularly enjoyed reading about Jacob's relationship with Emma, his grandfather's old flame, but I thought it should've been more complex - Jacob only seemed to doubt the morality of it once. The children were also interesting, creepy and charming. I'm still left wanting to know more about all of the characters though, there is still a lot of room for development. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but if there is a sequel (which there is certainly place for) then I'd feel a lot more positive about it. I'd love to learn more and follow Jacob and the children on their 'mission'. This is an unusual, unique read and it is something that I'd definitely recommend for teens and adults alike.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

9781594744761,"As soon as I opened to the first page the book had me hooked! The cooky photographs did the trick, I loved how you could put a face to the characters in the book. Most authors don't do this with photography but I thought it was different and definitely clever! The story line was great but... The ending made me feel a little disappointed and to be honest - a little sour! The way the story was heading - with loads of action and intrigue to then just stop. It seems to me Ransom Riggs left it open for a sequel but there could have been a better ending...",jessica shipman
9781594744761,"I've sat on this review for a little while because I wanted to let Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children sink in. And, if I'm honest, I wanted time to make up my mind about this book. It didn't work. Letting my mind breathe like a nice red wine has not allowed the flavour of my thoughts to mellow and mature. This book was like wine in a lot of ways, I guess. There was subtlety, complexity and richness. Furthermore, it was a book I could only sip. I'm usually all for swallowing books whole but I couldn't gulp at this one. And then there was the slight... bitterness. This book left a bad after-taste with me when I was done. Just like when you indulge in a few too many glasses of red, when I was finished with this I felt the face-palm of regret. I couldn't figure out why until I sat down to put my thoughts in line about this book. I regretted the fact that I didn't love the book as much as I had so desperately wanted to. Ransom Riggs' writing is interesting and I loved the premise of the story. Unfortunately, the only character I liked was the protagonist, Jacob. Everyone else in the story either got on my nerves a little bit or drove me completely nutty with annoyance! In some cases this annoyance came from the characters' qualities. The love interest, for example, (whose name escapes me...) was really irritating! Take that and couple it with the almost incestuous fact that she was Jacob's grandfather's ex (I know, right?) and this was a romance that just didn't float my boat. So many of the characters had such potential. There was one creepy li'l kid who could bring clay golems to life by giving them the hearts of living creatures. He was one of the few characters who had a bit more going on other than his peculiarity. In most other cases the peculiar children's little quirks were all they had. Their personalities weren't developed and there just wasn't much beneath the surface. The pictures were disturbing, even more so after the Afterword at the back of the book. These have me curious about Riggs' up and coming work, Talking Pictures. Other than these visual interludes, I found little else about the book creepy. So...where do I stand? Now that it comes to thinking about how many little stars to post below, I must admit that I'm a little bit stumped. This book has worked its way under my skin in spite of my disappointment with the book as a whole. I still want to read the sequel because there really is so much potential to this premise and these characters. I'm going to give this one a 3 star rating. A cynical little voice in my head is muttering that it should be lower. A bright little voice is chirping that it should be higher. Screw them both, I'm playing it safe and sitting my butt firmly on the fence!",Laura Williams

Once I got my money, I rushed to the bookstore, and tiptoed to the features section where all the newly released books were and grabbed it faster than a speeding bullet, stared at it and run my fingers on the book. I went home like a kid from the candy store. Hollow City is the sequel to the first novel by Ransom Riggs. We were left with the peculiar kids, travelling with Miss Peregrine, in her bird form, trying to find other loops where they'd be safe from the wights that follow them. The thing that I mostly enjoyed while reading the book is the gripping storyline and the suspense of each scene. I honestly didn't predict anything that was going to happen because you can't. While reading, I was invested fully on what they were doing, trying to save themselves from hollowgasts, meeting new peculiars and travelling through loops. I was hit with surprise, after surprise after surprise! Though you could say I was going to receive heart attacks from the spur of events, but through them I got to know more about the other peculiars abilities and that even from being stuck in their 1940 loop, they are still brave little souls, who are willing to risk their lives in order to save their loving Miss Peregrine from being a bird forever. The characterization is so much fuller this time around, which makes sense since the first novel became an introduction to the syndrigast world. Now, Hollow City is more action packed and mysterious in a way, with the main characters becoming more defined around the new characters introduced. This is honestly what I love about Ransom's novels. Even if you are thrown with so many characters, they are in their very way, special and couldn't be forgotten even if they were only in a couple of scenes. Out of all the new characters introduced, my favourites would have to be Althea, and Joel and Peter. They are the characters you wouldn't think would leave a mark, but they are a treat and oh so powerful. Jacob has become manlier and braver from the first novel. He has actually become more attractive in my imagination. Enoch, as always, is the most annoying yet the funniest foil I've ever encountered in a novel. I just love how he was written. Thank you for Enoch, Ransom. Another lovely aspect from this sequel is the travelling and different sidetracks in their adventures such as the wonderful gypsies and the annoying wights. It gives so much flavour to the story. Also, the hunt for the time loops through the help of the Peculiar storybook they have was very interesting. The stories were entertaining and when you got the first one, you were willing to decipher the next one with them. The photographs again were enchanting however, I must say, the photos in the first novel were scarier. Maybe it's because I knew that I'd get used to seeing them but nonetheless, they are still haunting and fascinating. Hollow City is a thrill to read and any booknerd would pull an all-nighter for this enthralling and wonderful read.",Writer For Misfits

9780547595290,"i bought this book for my son who is 4 years old. it is absolutely magical. there are 8 stories in this book (which is of very high quality, the binding is strong, the pages are rip resistant and the ink is exquisite). my son's bedtime routine includes having 2 bedtime stories read to him each night, and each story takes about 10 minutes to read .well, it takes us about 15 minutes because we like to discuss the beautiful illustrations on each page before moving on to the next page..., but if you are only reading the story without discussing what George is doing in the illustrations then it only takes about 10 minutes to read each story. as you have probably guessed, the illustrations in this book are first class. any child between the ages of 2 and (i would say) 7 will love them, but children older than this will probably be past the Curious George stage anyway, but if your child IS older than this and still loves Curious George then they will love them too. the stories themselves are told in a very easy to read and understand manner that will have both parents and children laughing out loud at George's antics. this book is so worth buying, either for your own son or daughter or as a gift for a friend's/relative's son or daughter in the right age group. it is one of the best books i have ever bought for my son, and he has a LOT of books Enjoy!",marleen molloy

9780141335278,"My review: This is the long-awaited conclusion to the Beautiful Creatures saga. And, honestly, it was my least favorite of the entire series. I had huge hopes for the book and, while I did enjoy it, I didn't love it as much as I would have expected or liked. The story was told from the switching POVs of Lena and Ethan, as they were apart for much of the book. While I didn't mind the back and forth (it was a necessary thing), I thought that the story dragged a bit during the time during which they essentially had separate lives. Unfortunately, at times it was difficult to really understand how much time was even passing in the story. I loved Ethan in this story, with his dedication and loyalty. I had a hard time pinning Lena down in this book, however. Sometimes she seemed powerful, the world's strongest Caster. Other times, she seemed a bit weak and ""damsely."" I came away from this series almost feeling as if her entire being was dependent upon Ethan's presence in order to have a life and a personality. All of that being said, I did enjoy the new twists and turns and the deep seated need to know how it would end for them kept me turning the pages! Things to love about Beautiful Redemption... --The ending. I liked how it ended and I liked the underlying message of love and loyalty. --The mythology. The mythology of the Caster world was pretty fascinating and we got a lot of it in this book. Things I wanted more of... --Ethan and Lena together. My recommendation: If you have read the other books in the series, this is a must-read to close out this wonderful series! My rating: A 3.5 mugs.",Kim
9780316077033,"This book exceeded my expectations so much. Most of the books that I read that are over hyped I end up not enjoying that much. That was not the case with this book. The writing style of the two authors came together in such a great way that it flowed and was just so great to read. A pet peeve of mine with most young adult novels is that I fell like they do not have enough descriptions and I find it hard to envision the places and people. This was another thing that this book did not suffer from. Everything was described so well and beautifully. The book is a really big book but the way it flowed made me read it so quickly that I felt as if the book were much shorter and wanted more when the book ended. Ethan was a really relate able character that was really well developed as well as all of the other characters, but I felt like I really got to know and love Ethan and really cannot wait to read the rest of the series to find out what happens to his relationship and rest of his life after high school. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a different ya book and one that is really well written.",Jessica Gibbins
9780316077033,"Beautiful Creatures is set in old Southern town where everyone knows all your dirty little secrets and appearances are everything! Complete with narrow mind house-wives waving their warm home cooked meals in their southern bell dresses, the town runs accordingly to their wishes. There's nothing that doesn't conform to their way, that is until Lena Duchannes strolls in and moves in with the town shut in, Macon Ravenwood, that things start to fall astray. Ethan Wate a local boy who's been having strange dreams about a girl who keeps falling inches away from his grasp, realizes that Lena Duchannes, the girl who wears the wrong clothes, speaks her mind and also happens to be Galtin's newest outcast, is the girl of his dreams. Literally. The countdown is on to Lena's birthday, the day she either turns Light or Dark, oh and don't forget the 200 year old curse that Lena and Ethan's ancestors caused that now plaque them both. The idea's behind this book are extremely complex, the mythology at times can be hard to keep up with, but I however found the richness of details made the story more compelling. There's a lot of mystery mix up within the novel, with bits of information slowly pieced out to reveal the complexity. The romance was insanely adorable, Ethan *sighs* there are no words to describe how cute and gentle-manlike he was, Ethan really was a true Southern gentleman. Every kiss was filled with the exhilarating feeling of star-crossed lovers and forbidden love that I like so much! As Lena and Ethan's relationship progressed we see the difficulties they have to overcome, and boy, there are some huge mountains they have to climb to be together. The more you read you see just how hard that's ultimately going to be. Beautiful Creatures is a very enjoyable read, although it may be a bit unnecessarily long, if you power through it I think you'll love it. I recommend it to anyone who's interested in Southern tales filled with a heart aching romance and captivating magic.",Taylor Weeks
9780316077033,"Beautiful Creatures is indeed an epic read that is dark, mysterious and everything like the cover. I honestly, did not expect to like this book at all and expected very little from it. From my past experiences with books that everyone's hyped up about. I always ended up indifferent to it. But this one was an exception that I actually liked, not as much as I wanted to like it. But I liked it enough to give it four stars. Kami and Margaret wrote the book in such a way that it always seemed gloomy and dark. The atmosphere in the book gave me the creeps. A lot of it. The book had your usual new girl, who has special powers and town boy falls in love with her. Despite that basic Young Adult Paranormal structure, the authors managed to surround that with tons of originality that pretty much filled the entire book till it reached 530 pages. Lena and Ethan were okay characters that honestly did annoy me sometimes. I even face-palmed myself once in awhile. But they were sweet together and they made me go ""aww"" sometimes. I was even surprised when the book was told in Ethan's perspective and not Lena's. I'm glad it was the hero this time. It made the book feel really refreshing. When Lena moves into town, she is immediately disliked and shunned when they all find out that she is the niece of the town shut in. She is bullied not only in school by the students but also by the student's parents. I admired Ethan's tenacity for sticking up for her especially when he is putting his reputation in jeopardy. The plot and other minor characters were so beautifully built with enough detail and a lot of dialogue to paint the perfect image in any readers mind. I'm amazed at how easily you can go through each page, not only because of the content but because of how easily to read the formatting was. It wasn't one of those books that love squishing a hell lot of paragraphs in one page. This was more breezy and simple. Overall, I liked Beautiful Creatures, it had dark voodoo magic, magic in general and interesting mythologies that keeps a reader captivated. Despite the length of the book, I still managed to flip through pages and that is a perfect sign of an entertaining and enjoyable book.",Najla Qamber
9780316077033,"At first I wasn't that thrilled to pick up Beautiful Creatures, because I thought about this novel as another small town story about a boy and a girl who can't be together, involving the same elements of love, same elements of danger as in so many other novels. Right now I have to reverse my thoughts and sayings about this novel. My love for Beautiful Creatures, started just with the perspective it's told from, the male protagonists POV, Ethan Wate. As many YA novels are told from a female POV I was a bit concerned I couldn't warm to Ethan. Well, I could warm to him, even more, I had to experience that a story told from Ethan's perspective can get very hot sometimes. I love how Kami and Margaret gave him personality, feelings and the gift to share them with the persons he loves. The way Ethan and Lena fall in love is unusual, they both have a special connection and when they first meet, both immediately know, they've known each other for more than a second then. Lena tries to hide from Ethan's attention, is afraid of letting him in, scaring him away. But Ethan is determined to find a way to Lena even if it means offending the rest of small town Gatlin. They both are unique characters, together they became one of my favourite literary couples. Beautiful Creatures stands out due to a, for some people cosy, for Ethan terribly boring and lonely, setting turning into a mysterious and miraculous place. Beautiful Creatures is about a young love between mortal and super-""natural"" interlaced with the story of ancient Civil War and a curse that has not only affected their powers but true identity and feelings since then. This novel holds the very innovative idea of combining history with the story of a paranormal romance. The writing style and language of Beautiful Creatures is rich and absorbing, very surprising when you think of it as a novel written by four hands (make it some more, counting in the daughter- slaves). While reading the brilliant ending of Beautiful Creatures, I had to get up in the middle of the night and turn the computer on again to order its sequel. The end was a spectacle of unexpected events and great feelings. Although this novel has no major cliff hanger at the end, there are many questions unanswered. It's the looming storm only a few more days away which makes me want to read the sequel immediately. There are so many great characters living in small Gatlin, everyone different but still important for the storyline, the city could burst just because of its enormously diverse character collection. So the roles are defined. Initiator of the gloomy curse: Civil War ancestor. Young cursed lovers: Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes. The malice enemy: you'll be surprised! And last but not least, the satisfied but still hungry reader: You! Beautiful Creatures made be feel like a cast myself: being released into an universe of numerous magical possibilities but everytime riveted by the spellbinding words of two powerful casters. THE VERDICT Beautiful Creatures is a must-read for fans of paranormal romance that place a high value on an exciting storyline, unique characters and the potential for many unforeseen events. You are totally spellbound by this book and believe it's a cast? No, it's just the magic of an amazing new YA novel!",MissPageTurner
9780316077033,"This is the first paranormal romance I've read in which the story is told from the male characters point of view, so it was a little refreshing.

9780316077040,"My review: This next book picks up not long after the first in the series, Beautiful Creatures, ends. In my opinion, this book is darker than the first, coming on the heels of personal tragedy within the story line. I think one of the things I loved the most was how grief was handled. It wasn't glossed over at all, giving it total reality. The setting of a southern small town, along with the gothic elements, is a definite stereotype of southern living, and maybe a little over the top. But it works perfectly within the context of the story and sets the stage for even more secrets to be revealed. There was much more development of the characters in this book, too, which really brought some of the characters to life. Interestingly, one of the characters that most came to life for me was one that was actually dead. Ethan was much more of a strong presence in this book, a lot of his story being his own instead of entwined with Lena's. The angst level was a lot higher in this book, something that usually tends to annoy me. But it is something that really worked for this story. It added a pretty dark layer to the entire story and served to underscore a lot of the issues in the book. Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --Answers. A lot of questions were answered in this installment of the Beautiful Creatures series. --Questions. As many questions that were answered, there were all kinds of new questions that leave me wanting to start the next book. Things I wanted more of... --The mundane world. Most of the story took place in the Caster world and not nearly as much in the non-magical world. I missed the blend. My recommendation: You definitely have to read these in order to experience the flow of the story. I think the story was better than the last and I recommend this one just as much as the first.",Kim
9780316077040,"After the pleasing end of Beautiful Creatures I was eager to read Beautiful Darkness immediately to remain in the diverse Caster universe and don't quit my quality time with Ethan yet. But I also feared the looming conflict between Lena and Ethan growing to a concrete, which is, as Beautiful Darkness is the second book in a quartet, almost inevitable to provide the structure of an overall suspense curve. Where other novels exercise the obligatory separation of our couple by keeping them away from each other completely, Ethan and Lena still got a kind of psychical connection and are only physically separated. So the importance of Ethan and Lena's psychical bond is once again accentuated. I am looking forward to learn more about their special connection in the next two books. As in Beautiful Creatures, the story is told from Ethan Wate's point of view whose character is as adorable and charming as in the first Caster Chronicles novel. There are very few male narrators in YA fantasy novels, because female authors often tend to apply female narrators I think. Although Lena's development and her decisions around becoming a light or dark Caster form the centre of the Caster Chronicles series, the story is told from Ethan's point of view. In my opinion this choice of perspective is the best the authors could have applied, because experiencing Lena through the eyes of Ethan, and so someone who loves her and cares about her fate, establishes a very intense connection with her although she isn't our narrator and supports the mysterious atmosphere of the whole story. Interesting about Beautiful Darkness is, that we see the happenings through Ethan's eyes, but are at the same time accomplice with Lena. Keeping a secret from Ethan almost broke my heart. In Beautiful Creatures there was a particular short chapter, told from Lena's point of view and I haven't read a novel before in which a single chapter of the first novel has such an enormous impact on its sequel. The conflict grows slowly but steadily and the secrets kept accumulate into an adventurous race for life or death. Various plot strands build a delicately branched web of an unforeseeable suspense you can't but get caught in. In the end there seem to be many secrets unsolved and still a gigantic potential left. Not only main characters show major changes, secondary characters, too. Characters being cold and resistant before finally show feelings, evil and cruel characters become even crueller. Also many new characters are introduced. Some are new allies, friendly and light, others are even darker than the already established Beautiful Creatures villains. A satisfying sequel to Beautiful Creatures, full of all-consuming emotions, inevitable decisions and unforeseeable outcomings. Do you already feel the beautiful darkness creeping into your heart? THE VERDICT Again, a beautifully written novel by the talented casters Garcia and Stohl. They once again proof their talent to apply witty elements and develop an extensive storyline by creating an universe of a novel which is as huge and infinite as the Caster sky itself. And as many constellations there are to spot, there are just as many opportunities for exciting and new story elements, special abilities and characters. New fantasy elements meet solid writing style- The Caster world fills the gap between werewolves and vampires, faeries and magicians and leaves an urgent need for more.",MissPageTurner
9780141326092,"Frankly speaking, I found the first book (Beautiful Creatures, now, a big movie franchise) too much of a drag to read mainly because of how prolonging it was. I wasn't planning on reading or listening to the rest of the series anytime soon. But thanks to my eldest sister's audiobook, I managed to finish it within 3 days. Best thing about this is that I get to listen to it while I worked. I call it 'double productivity' and with that double productivity, I actually grew to love the series! When the book started, I groaned and I did it because the author(s) reuses the same plot from the first book and renames it 17th Moon instead of 16th Moon. Then they begin to write circles and differences around it. But you've got to hand it to them, they did write a damn good book! Ethan (the main character) is a sweetheart and in this installment, the poor guy goes through heaven and hell for Lena (his female counter part). Man, I hate Lena. She's such a victim I can't stand. Even worse are the decisions that she makes, and the fact that she completely doesn't confide in Ethan, like they used to, makes me groan some more! I even rolled my eyes at her a couple of times. I am so happy I don't have to deal with her as the main character. I wouldn't want to get stuck in that head of hers. In the end, my favorite character is Link (Ethan's lame best friend) instead of Ethan. He's one of those dorky characters that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. He can even be considered as the ""Ron Weasley"" of the whole series. He is very much linked to the end of this installment that will literally blow your mind with it's awesomeness! Likewise, we've got the adversaries of Ethan and his gang. The mastermind of the whole evilness reminds me too much of the bad guy in The Hunger Games. But then again, nothing is really new out there. Now, for the beautiful yet gothic land of Gaitlin, South Carolina. So dark, so mystical. I just want to move into this fictional town and spend the rest of my life doing the things I love with the people I love. Of course, I'll only live there if the fictional characters of Gaitlin weren't. If you dislike the characters, you sure won't dislike the town they live in (minus the people). Gaitlin isn't just a home for humans but also Witches or Casters as they like to be called. The world Stohl and Garcia creates for the Casters is so dark and haunting, you can't help but call it beautiful. Undoubtedly, I adored the book. The writing style is flat out written for not only the teens but for mothers, fathers, older brothers, etc. Some characters will surely keep you glued to the book while the storyline remains with the same foundation but still has the ability to keep the reader going, and most importantly, the book encompasses the Beautiful Darkness that continues to draw me even closer to the characters and overall, to the entire series. And with that, I quickly moved to the 3rd book and I'm half way done with the book!",Najla Qamber
9780141326092,"What else can I say? Wonderful. Amazing. Thrilling. Frustrating. Yes, very frustrating. Lena drove me nuts. That John Breed irritated me to death but you can't blame him.

9780316231657,"My review: This book was already a movie by the time I began the series, which I have since seen and will talk about in a different post soon! I really liked this book, more than I expected to. For some reason, I went into it thinking it was going to be somewhat corny/sappy romance with the other elements to make it a truly well-rounded story. But there is a little bit of everything in this book... secrets, mystery, angst, magic, and more. There were two things that truly made a great foundation for this book, and really the whole series. One was that it is written to be a somewhat multi-generational story, weaving in and out of family histories. There is a lot of richness to be had in that kind of family saga. The other thing I liked was the gothic element that wove together the love between Lena and Ethan and the darkness that made up the paranormal elements of the story. The story is set in a quintessential southern town, still reliving the Civil War and making it a deep part of the town's culture. But, even with the occasional trips back in time, this could not be labeled historical fiction. Instead that history served as a backdrop for the story. Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --The character of Lena. I loved that she wasn't created to be the epitome of teenage perfection. She struggled deeply with darkness and that made her so much more believable and likable. --The alternate world. I loved how the authors created a world for the Casters and laid it on top of our own. The existence of the Caster Library is an example of this. A magical library with a librarian that exists below the regular library. The mythology of magic was thoroughly blended with that of the mundane. --The ending. It left a fabulous opening for the next book. --The POV. It was told from the POV of Ethan, instead of the usual female lead. This was refreshing! Things I wanted more of... --The mythology of the Caster world. I am hoping that this is explored is explored more full in subsequent books. My recommendation: If you like paranormal YA, I would suggest this. I liked the characters a whole lot more than those of certain vampire fiction. There is darkness and angst, but it doesn't overload the teenage emo attitude. I will definitely be reading the next book",Kim
9780141326085,"It took me a while to start this book. And then it took me a while to read it through. Yes, it's a good read, but the overall writing wasn't as captivating as I expected. It's kind of slow paced, and occasionally just not that fluent. There's the whole thing with the Civil War. Yes, it's somewhat important part of the characters' history, but all the historical reenactments and history lessons just didn't do it for me. Same with the DAR and PTA. Witch hunt also included, but that was a big part of the plot, so that I could have lived with. Parts about the Civil War could have been completely removed, and I probably wouldn't have noticed a difference. They only distracted me, and I wished those parts were replaced with Ethan's and Lena's romance. Since there could have been so much more details about that, then I would've been happy. Overall, I liked Ethan and Lena. A couple, who are destined to be together, though the fate is against them. Especially when we find out the thing about Mortals and Casters not working so well together. Ethan is a narrator, which was interesting considering women authors. Despite that, Ethan was a believable character. He's blind to Lena's flaws, but isn't that how it always is when you're madly in love with someone. They're the perfection and you would do anything for them. So Ethan's quite the knight in shiny armor through out the book. And Lena. She seems so nice. So, so nice. She would never even hurt a fly, except when she loses the control of her powers. But then again, when she gains the control, her niceness starts cracking. The thing with the book and sort of brainwashing her aunt and cousin? Not nice! So even though I liked her and Ethan together, I liked Ethan more. There's a bunch of other people hanging around, but only few I really liked, being Uncle Macon, Link and Ridley. Believe it or not, I really liked her! Especially the thing with ""Sympathy for the devil""- song, that was quite funny. Luckily, there's more of her in the second book! Overall, a good read. The ending saved the whole book, before that I had some troubles following the story, but the end was loud and clear. I cried like a baby. Like I always do, when there's a good story going on. This was the reason I started book 2 right away!",Monaliz @ Mind Reading?
9780141326085,"A lot of people have recommended this read to me so I just had to pick it up. For the most part it was a good read for me. A boy growing up in a town that he wants to get away from and a new, completely unusual girl comes into the picture that interests him because she's so different to what he's used to. It's the basis of a story that can go anywhere. It had a lot of exciting and shocking events within the story that made me feel for the main characters but the problem was it went on too long. It's fine for a book to be over 500 pages, but when it gets repetitive it's hard to finish for the storyline and not for the sake of finishing it because I had already read 400 pages. The characters themselves were great. Lena was a strong character that didn't take no for an answer and Ethan was sweet. The supporting characters were good too. Link (Ethan's best friend) was funny and seemed to be the opposite to Ethan which was probably why they fit so well. The characters that are there to sort of test the protagonists - which they did in bucket loads - were written really well. Beautiful Creatures is all about this curse that Lena has. It's all about counting down to Lena's sixteenth birthday when something disastrous is going to happen. The build up to the birthday is full of suspense which is definitely what kept me reading. Which brings me to another problem I had. The timing of this book was brilliant until it got closer to the birthday. It just seemed like as it got closer to the date in the book the time gap between events got shorter and shorter which put me off a little. It wasn't evenly distributed if that makes sense. Something would happen and then readers are reminded the date is three months away, but then something else would happen and then reader's are reminded that the birth day is the next week. It was a little frustrating. The setting of the story - a small town called Gatlin - was brilliantly written. It was a place that was meant to be suffocating and stuffy. It was meant to put people off, at least people who had any sense according to Ethan. I think it was the perfect place for a story like Beautiful Creatures to take place. Gatlin was probably my most favourite aspect of the novel. Overall, I did enjoy this read because it has a little of everything. I do recommend it for those who like novels filled with suspense, nasty schoolgirls and sweet romance that develops in its own time.",Maryam H

9780141326085,"I like the humor in the story lines. Chapter one, and the book had me giggling on my lunch break with everybody giving me looks in the staff room. I think that earned the storytelling quality a 4 out of 5. The story itself even if it is not terribly original is quite captivating. The authors have seamlessly blended modern day teen culture with paranormal fantasy that as a reader I could believe in. If I have to grade the ""suspension of disbelief"" for this story I will have to give it a 4.5 out of 5. The ending however is a cliffhanger. Although the ending did close the book nicely, it is also the beginning of the next book. Gave the impression that the whole book is just chapter one of a bigger book. That earned a 2 out of 5. The cover art? It could do better. I have seen this book for sometime now in the blogosphere but ignored it for a few months just because I do not find the cover attractive to my fantasy reader's eyes. The art department who did this cover needs to be fired. In a marketing graph, this cover art would be a 1 out of 5. Overall, this book is a 3.5 out of 5.",Cherry
9780141326085,"Firstly, I have to say I had a slight giggle to myself about the green eyes and black hair (I should really start a list to see how many paranormal protagonists we can find with green eyes and/or black hair). The first person narrative is written from the perspective of the male protagonist (Ethan) something I did find hard to relate to being a girl and having three girls myself (J has to get in touch with his feminine side in our house or shut the door to watch sport). There is dramatic tension almost from the first page. The background descriptions of the characters and the setting were fantastic and really fed my technicolor imagination. The use of the Gothic convention of nesting (a story within a story) was deployed with great efficiency adding significance to the main plot. There is clever use of the history of the civil war intertwining the story, although I can appreciate the detail and depth it added to the story it is probably easier to relate to if you are American and studied the Civil War. The references to To Kill a Mockingbird were intriguing and have certainly inspired me to read it. I found the description of Ethan's aunts an ingenious parallel to the mythical fates or even the witches in Macbeth. The references to religion and voodoo were extraordinary and well written, the cross-over element between religions was enlightening. Although, I found the classification of all paranormal/supernatural beings as Casters was too much of a generalisation for me, I appreciate that all things contain good and bad elements, the yin and yang if you will, but I like my neat little categories Vampire, Witch, Shifter, etc but that is just a personal preference. The Gothic imagery was fantastic, I especially liked the description of the libraries (I wonder why!). The use of Latin and Welsh (yeah! WELSH) was just fantastic (not that I am biased because I am Welsh). The action is tightly packed towards the end of the book and the ending is a cliff-hanger. However, there were some elements that bothered me, I found the relationship between Ethan and Lena to be very intense considering their ages (15 & 16) perhaps it is just he mother coming out in me as I do not think I would be very happy if one of my daughters was in such an intense relationship at that age. I guess the point is that soul mates/reincarnation has no age limits. I also found Amma's changing attitude to Lena to be a bit confusing. On the whole an enjoyable paranormal romance/thriller with some terrific quotes.",Emma Davies
9780141326085,"I haven't seen a bad review about this book yet so my expectations of this book were exceedingly high... and I think that ruined it a bit for me. Don't get me wrong, I still thoroughly enjoyed this masterfully written tale, but just not as much as I thought I would. First of all, I loved Ethan. I thought he was extremely sweet and honest protagonist. He wasn't pretending to be a saint, but nor did he do anything bad. Lena on the other hand... I just couldn't bring myself to like her. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't feel a connection with her, and I couldn't see why Ethan liked her so much. Link was another character I adored. How he can manage to be so laid back and funny with a mother like his I'll never know. And he really was funny; I would have loved for there to be more of him in the book; with quotes like: ""Shut up. You're so whipped I should buy you a saddle."" I found the plot to be unique and the writing engaging. I loved the To Kill A Mockingbird (by Harper Lee) references and found the similarities between Gatlin and Maycomb astounding. Beautiful Creatures is almost a modern-day fantasy version of TKAM. Having said all of that, I will definitely re-read this book and I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel! Overall, I'm giving this book 4 and a 1/2 stars out of 5. It misses out on that half a star for me just because I could connect with Lena, but that doesn't mean anyone else will have the same problem. Therefore, I recommend this book to everyone who loves fantasy, To Kill A Mockingbird and YA literature in general.",Amy Mansell
9780316123518,"My review: This has been my favorite thus far in the series. There are so many twists and turns and I was always trying to guess what was going to happen next. It was action-packed and the secret quotient was definitely raised. The weaving themes of love and sacrifice, both romantic and not, was beautiful and it makes the reader look just a little differently at them. The characters were as strong as they have ever been, as real as possible when created within the pages of a book. I was swept right along with them through their highs and their lows. I actually did my fair share of crying, ugly crying, at points! Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --The mood. This is most definitely NOT a ""feel good"" book! But I liked that because it was raw and heart wrenching and real. The feelings that it evoked were intense and engrossing. --The ending. Not that I wanted the book to end, but the cliffhanger was good! Things I wanted more of... --The supporting characters. So much of this centered on Ethan, which was great, but I have grown to enjoy a lot of the less central characters. My recommendation: Love, love, LOVE so definitely pick this up!",Kim
9780316123525,"This is one of my most favorite series, I love it! Beautiful Chaos picks up where Beautiful Darkness leaves off. Ethan and Lena are trying to find John Breed and fix the mess that he left. School is staring and Ridley is joining them. Link is a ladies man now and this causes major problems with Ridley and the cheerleaders. Amma has turned to the dark side and all of Gatlin is drying up and the heat is unbearable. If that wasn't enough, everyone's powers are messed up. Anything I write in this review is not going to do any justice. I loved everything that was written. There are so many ups and downs, twists and turns and just too many things to write about. The characters come more into their own in this one. The story line is well written and I just love the whole southern vibe. I love Ethan and Lena's love story and how they stand by each other no matter what. Ridley and Link are just too funny, they are some of my favorite characters in this series. I was pleasantly surprised by a new relationship that develops, you'll have to read the book to find out who it is. I enjoyed learning about Sarafine and who she was before she turned dark. Macon is always popping up when you least except him to which just makes it more interesting. Oh yeah and I can't leave out the cliffhanger ending. Yeah it's the best one yet! Again, I can't express how much I LOVED reading this. Each time I read the next one it surprises me how much it tops the previous books. If you haven't started reading the Caster Chronicles series you should, it's amazing! I can't wait for the next one!",Unknown
9780316042673,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Okay, I'm going to start off by saying that I don't read many books that have males as the main character in the story. I guess it's because I relate better with a female point-of-view, so when I first picked up this book, I had no clue it was told in the POV of a male. For some reason I had always thought it was a female. When I found out the main character was a male, I was worried that I may not be able to get into it. Which I am VERY glad to say I DEFINITELY got into it. I was hooked after only a few chapters in. Sometimes it seemed like the story dragged on, but then something would happen that would make all of that alright. I would easily fly through 20 pages without realizing. It took me longer than it should have to read Beautiful Creatures, I guess because I didn't want the story to end. (Even though I know there is a sequel.) Garcia and Stohl did a great job at keeping the story captivating and unique. The story wasn't predictable at all, which I absolutely loved. I hate being able to figure out what will happen before it happens. It's much more fun being completely surprised to the point your jaw drops. (Which happened a lot, by the way.) They did an awesome job at the descriptions of everything, I could easily picture everything and felt as though I was right there experiencing everything. Their details are amazing! I also love the fact that this novel is a mixture of different things; romance, mystery, historical facts, magic! All of the characters felt real. Besides Lena and Ethan, I really loved Uncle Macon. He was hilarious and had me cracking up at nearly everything he said. His secret REALLY surprised me. Which I'm not going to get into because I really want it to make your jaw drop as well. :) Overall, there isn't really much I can say about this book other than I loved it. I can never really explain all the reasons why I loved a book. Especially one that has made it to a favorite. I guess I've been saying that a lot around the blog. I've been picking out great books to read.",Amanda
9780316042673,"Romeo and Juliet appear to have had it easy in comparison to Ethan and Lena in Beautiful Creatures. They not only have their families telling them to steer clear of each other, but they're also dealing with humans vs. casters (a.k.a. witches) in this struggle. Talk about your star crossed lovers tale, but how does this one end you ask? Are they to suffer the same fate as Romeo and Juliet? Or will they find a way to defy the odds stacked against them? I'm not telling of course...read on people! And boy was it ever a struggle! Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl know just how to write the twists and turns, joys and heartaches to keep their readers not knowing what to expect with every turn of the page. They had me hook, line and sinker without a clue as to what the outcome would be until the very end. Our main characters were set in a small town in the south and one that has very old ways. We're talking extremely conservative here people. But Ethan and Lena weren't alone while trying to beat the clock and squeak out a happy ending for everyone involved. Lena's family was one of my favorite parts of the story. Her uncle Macon (the town recluse) was entertaining and mysterious of course, and he kept my attention throughout. Ethan's close but yet strange relationship with Amma won her a place in my heart - she was scary with her charms and voodoo, but her love for Ethan overpowered my fear of her. But that's not to say you should underestimate Amma, if Macon Ravenwood doesn't square off with her, what chance would I have? With the rest of the Ravenwood/Duchannes family making surprise appearances, along with our lovable librarian friend Marion Ashcroft, this book had a wonderful cast of characters to call it's own. Although the story was slow in parts for me, I think the action scenes were very much filled with suspense and the right amount of thrills. I'm hoping the second installment in the Caster Chronicles, Beautiful Darkness will have more action and substance now that Beautiful Creatures has laid out all the groundwork for us. We've got the background now and we're ready for more of this world that Garcia and Stohl have created.",Katelyn
9780316077057,"While I liked this book, I did not like it as much as the first. It is also one of the ones that is next to impossible for me to review without giving spoilers.

9780316077057,"When I tried to formulate my review for this book I was torn, and I kind of still am. I'm a big fan of Garcia and Stohl's writing and enjoyed the first installment in the Caster Chronicles series, Beautiful Creatures, but I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it's sequel. There were some elements that I loved and some that I didn't enjoy much at all. Let me try to make some sense of my ramblings. To start off, I can say that while I found Beautiful Creatures to be slow in some parts, that was not the case with Beautiful Darkness. We did get more background and of course some histories and mysteries were cleared up, but at the same time the plot wasn't slowed down because of this. Ethan is back as our narrator and this time around he really (for me at least) became a stronger character. If anyone thought he and Lena's troubles/obstacles were over, they were wrong. In fact, their previous problems were nothing in comparison in my opinion. Garcia and Stohl upped the anti (so to speak) in this one and that aspect won me over and kept me reading. Ethan's personality came out more and I think readers will get the chance to see him as an individual as far as his feelings go and will only grow to love him even more. Now for what I wasn't really loving about this book. We meet some new characters in Beautiful Darkness and they didn't really win me over like I expected them to. Garcia and Stohl gave us such an all star cast in Beautiful Creatures, maybe in my mind they just didn't stand a chance of measuring up, I don't know? But some of the original characters upset and disappointed me too. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I can't be specific, but when this book hits the shelves and readers get their hands on it, I don't think I'll be the only one feeling this way. But to end on a good note, I did like the wrap-up Garcia and Stohl wove together in the end. All I will say is that the Caster Chronicles series can only get more interesting and I'm extremely curious to see what happens next. Cliffhangers vs. neatly tied up endings, which do I prefer? I'm not really sure, but what I do know is that I'm still a fan of Garcia and Stohl's writing and I'm looking forward to reading what the Caster Chronicles will bring us next.",Katelyn

9781853260322,"It is a peculiar case: some very interesting characters and family dynamics, with a wealth of layered detail, but I found the basic social message of the book rather uncongenial. Austen's heroine is Fanny Price, informally adopted by her rich uncle and aunt; Fanny is generally passive and when she expresses an opinion tends towards priggishness (with the author's full approval); the stable conservative world of Mansfield Park is under threat from the cosmopolitan horrors of London, but Fanny supports the resistance. Most of the climactic events take place off-screen in the last few chapters, which is a bit unsatisfying. (Also the kind rich uncle clearly has made his money thanks to slavery.) The book does have its points of interest, but I would advise anyone thinking of casual dabbling in Austen to stick to Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion.",Nicholas Whyte
9781840220995,"This is one of Dostoevsky's most famous and least understood novels. In fact it is famous for being exactly what it ISN'T: a reactionary screed that provides a fictional format for Dostoevsky's autocratic views. Sadly, this is the reputation this fascinating and absorbing book has. Yet Dostoevsky was far too great an artist (and too good a Christian) to be an ideologue of any kind. True, the anarchists are crazy and the liberals are often vain and posturing. But the Tsarist authorities are portrayed as incompetent buffoons and spiritual values rather than any political affiliation are what matter at the end of the day. Furthermore, the description of Dostoevsky as 'conservative' is itself over-simplistic as he always had great sympathy for the poor and opposed serfdom. In fact the closest thing to a hero the novel has is the character Shatov who is of peasant origin: a failed anarchist, a failed Slavophile and yet on a personal level the most sympathetic, forgiving and generous character. Whilst I feel annoyed at how little understood this novel is, ironically it feels fitting because this book thrives on strangeness, deception and duplicity. Most novels have a clearly defined protagonist, a clearly defined plot with beginning/middle/end and a clearly defined theme. It is difficult to discern any of this in Demons. It begins as a social comedy about Stepan Trofimovitch Verkhovensky a kind of provincial wannabe DeTocqueville, who believes himself to be a great thinker but is too bone idle and cowardly to publish anything, his platonic friend Varvara Stavrogin and the eccentric characters who live in their village. In this part Dostoevsky demonstrates his greatly under-rated wit and gift for dialogue. Yet even here the more gothic and strange aspect of his writing is already developing. Stepan Verkhovensky and Varvara Stavrogin are in some ways the 'other' of their counterpart. Similarly the details of their children interesting opposites. Stepan neglects his son Peter whilst Varvara's son Nicholas is adored and spoilt. As the novel progresses, the 'children' come back. As Nicholas is announced, Peter appears. The two have both become involved in revolutionary politics. Both insincerely. Once again, it is important to stress what Demons is not: the boys are led to terrorism out of ennui and dissatisfaction with the turgid society their parents live in. Dostoevsky does not do this out of bad didactic writing but because the idea of conflict in generational terms has great dramatic potential. The character of Peter is especially dramatically fascinating. In many ways he makes me think of Malcolm McDowall in the film A Clockwork Orange. He is charming and articulate but gets excited by violence and chaos. Furthermore, he was brutally neglected by his father and for that reason is not entirely unsympathetic. Nicholas Stavrogin is both a contrast and a twin to Peter Verkhovensky. The spoilt, rich, irresistibly handsome Nicholas feels ennui from his exhausting the world of its pleasures. Yet Peter desires Nicholas as a figurehead for the movement, whilst Nicholas finds it difficult to sustain his interest. As strange and violent events occur in the provincial village, we meet Von Lembke, a Volga German administrator of the region. Along with Shatov, VonLembke is the most likable character. He is (like Shatov) a failure in many ways but also generous, kind and loyal. When he lapses into insanity it is truly tragic and along with the scene in which Shatov forgives his wife (who had an affair with a friend, who was also the son of his benefactor) demonstrates Dostoyevsky's gift for writing scenes that are emotionally affecting without being sentimental. The entire story ends (strangely, and yet characteristically) with a double tragedy. One of which is the counterpart to the other. In all, this is the ultimate political novel, precisely because it demonstrates that people create political ideals rather than inventing characters to personify political ideals.",Gregor Matheson

I love how each boy had a job to do handled by their keepers. Did I mention the new slang words that James whipped up? I??????C/??m guessing shanks aren??????C/??t all that positive to start with. Each character had a way of talking and that truly shows their I individual personalities as well. I quite enjoyed this adventurous dystopian tale where teens are tested once again to survive. The writing was fluid, always giving you something more in each and every chapter. I loved the mystery and suspense that Mr. Dashner concocted in his Maze Runner world. The world building is flawless and I can??????C/??t wait to read more!",Giselle SM
9780385737951,"Oh well, this book was actually really good. I was sure I was going to detest it so I'm actually very surprised of how The Maze Runner surprised me. I find TMR plot really interesting, I don't know if that makes me a bad person, but the whole idea of sending this kids to this unknown place with only a name as a memory is really intriguing. I really don't want to spoil the book, the blurb says pretty much all that happens at first. Of course there is a big development of characters and you get to know all these boys -Gladers- little by little. There are so many questions, what is their purpose? what is the Maze about? why does Thomas feel the way he feels? how does the maze work? I loved the fact that the reader can feel how Thomas is feeling, I mean, he was lost and there weren't a lot of answers to his question about this place. He was sad, mad, and frustrated. And I was feeling that way too. And there is so much slang! at first I had trouble getting used to all the words but it is definitely part of the experience. I liked the characters, there are definitely one or two I hated but Minho, Newt",Laura
9780385737951,"This book has sci-fi, dystopian, and post-apocalyptic elements in it, I mean what more could you ask for? This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. There is so much suspense and questions that constantly arise that keep you engrossed in the book and it was so hard for me to put this book down while reading. Although the writing style of the book annoyed me a little bit, I really enjoyed this book a lot more than other dystopian books. I really liked how in The Glade they had their own words for different things and it was really fun learning their language. The challenges that the man character has to go through and the world that he is currently in really makes you feel for and root for him. The character development and relationships between the characters was done really well and I even found myself crying near the end of the book. I am really excited for and cannot wait to read the rest of the series. I recommend this book to anyone who likes dystopian books and is looking for a different and unique one for all the ones that are currently out.",Jessica Gibbins
9780385737951,"I ordered this trilogy of books all at once and I recommend that if you get sucked into stories quickly, you do the same too. The Maze Runner was a bit of a slow starter, but if you get into it, it's hard to put down. His other two books in the trilogy were AMAZING too!! Very clever and inventive, like nothing I've read before.",Audrey
9780385737951,"Thomas is brought up to the Glade in an elevator with only his name and no memory at all. He finds himself with a group of boys like himself. They all have no memory of an outside world. All they know is that there is a maze and they will try to find a way out -but every night the doors to the maze will shut. The day after Thomas arrives, a girl, the first ever in the Glade, arrives with a note that she is the last. Thomas is determined to figure out what is happening in the Glade and unlock the secrets that are buried. THE MAZE RUNNER is the start to a thrilling new trilogy. If you are a fan of dystopian science fiction, then this title needs to be added to your must-read pile. Author James Dashner has a brilliant start to the book; the Gladers use different slang, which takes some time to get used to. However, this leaves the reader feeling just as jarred as Thomas when the book starts and you find yourself learning about the Glade right along with the main character. I've never really had that experience with a book before, so kudos to Mr. Dashner for a brilliant storytelling device. The story has somewhat of a slow start, but readers who stick with it will be rewarded. I'm warning you - there are lots of cliffhangers and heart-stopping adventure, and you'll want to stay up late turning pages to find out what happens next.",TeensReadToo
9780385738750,"After reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner earlier this year, it was inevitable that I would hurry to pick up The Scorch Trials. Before doing so, however, I refreshed my memory with another read-through of The Maze Runner... and I think I liked it even more the second time around. With The Scorch Trials I found it easier to adapt to the world and the ""variables"" being thrown at Thomas and his crew, mostly because of how The Maze Runner had prepared me for them. Dashner does a fantastic job of building the tension and then, just when it gets to the breaking point, throwing in something so random, so out of the blue, that the tension subsides and starts to build in another, different way. What makes The Scorch Trials so different from The Maze Runner is - now that the kids know who WICKED is, they have a bit more knowledge of what is going on - but that still doesn't mean that this book will make complete sense to you, as it doesn't to them. And that is what makes the book so much fun. There is plenty of action, plenty of excitement and I grew even more attached to these characters, these teenagers struggling in a world where hope seems so dead. I cannot wait to get my hands on the last book in this trilogy and next year cannot come soon enough. I haven't felt this much anticipation for a book since Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins - and while the books are somewhat similar, I really appreciate the teamwork Dashner has chosen to implement in The Maze Runner trilogy and think he's doing a fantastic job of telling his story.",Lydia Presley

9780007203543,"It takes a certain skill to be able to read a Tolkein book. A strong sense of concentration and an ability to keep a firm grasp of complicated plots is definitely needed. After reading this book, my belief that books are always better than (superior to) their big screen counterparts is even stronger. Whilst Bilbo's birthday party, and I'm assuming here that you've watched the movie, only takes five minutes to describe on screen, Tolkein's written description takes a mere fifty pages to flick through. Each detail is painstakingly recorded, down to the littlest hair on the head of the littlest hobbit child. The history of the Hobbits alone requires at least an hour's reading pleasure. If you feel a little in need of literary revival, then the Fellowship of the Rings is only one step of three towards your goal.

9781932664126,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. I liked this book much better than the first one, but I've given them the same rating. I felt the same way throughout this book as I did when I finished the first one, if that makes sense. My problems with book one have mostly been taken care of now and I found this a pleasant, humorous diversion. I can understand the cult appeal this has had. I still don't think it is suitable for younger audiences and while this book is not as ""adult"" as the first book it still is about college students, not YAs and I was pleased to see that my library has it shelved in the adult section. So, anyway, lots of fun. I love the video game angle, it's cute. Scott is a jerk, but Ramona is cool. This volume does a lot of flashbacks to Scott's past so we learn a bit more about him, these transitions are shaky though and one doesn't often realize one is in the past right away. The battle scenes are good and I'm really starting to enjoy the characters' personalities, except for Scott, of course. I'll continue the series, but I'm wondering if Scott is going to develop as a person throughout the series or is it just going to be about him beating the evil boyfriends.",Nicola Mansfield
9780007340477,"This is definitely one of the best comic books I've read recently, if not ever. It's funny, quirky - without going overboard - and imaginative. The art work is simple but brilliant. It's not very often I really love the characters in comics but Scott and his friends are actually awesome! Scott thinks he's totally cool but the reality is that he doesn't have a job, he likes two girls - one of which is still in high school -and he shares a bed with his gay roommate, Wallace, as they can't afford another one. Can he really get the amazing Ramona by battling the evil exes?",Tasha
9781932664492,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. This was much better than volume three! The story has picked up and the humour is once again fresh. This had me giggling in quite a few places. Also just when I had given up hope in the last volume, Scott actually hits a crossroads in his life where he has to take on some responsibility and his character is strengthened for it . He's still pretty clueless and lazy, but *not quite so much* of a jerk. I may possibly like him by the end of the series if this continues. I like Ramona but this volume she became a bit annoying as her usually mature early 20s behaviour slid a notch into more high school-like jealousies. A few new characters were introduced, some may be permanent while others were obviously just for this volume. I'd like to reiterate that the publisher recommends this book (and series) for ages 13+ but I am emphatically recommending it for 18+. It is shelved in the adult section of my local library with good reason. The story is about college age youths , 20-26, with one 17yo who is dragged into a lifestyle she is not old enough to be living. The books contain a fare share of language and a lot of s*xual innuendo and s*x talk, plus implied s*xual relations. This book in particular deals specifically with lesbian and gay s*x. While this is a topic I would have preferred to do without I am pleased that the story is shaping up to be more than just Scott vs evil boyfriend. Of course, he does fight the requisite boyfriend but there are more layers behind the characters now. I am enjoying the major characters at this time in the series and while I'm not always thrilled with the content, I am vested in finishing the series.",Nicola Mansfield
9781932664225,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. Not a lot happens in this volume and I can't say I was all that entertained this time around. A lot of the book is spent with Scott's friends hanging out with Envy's band and all the uncomfortable angst that brings about since Scott used to date Envy, Scott is now dating Ramona, Envy is talking trash to Ramona, Knives would like to kill Envy, Envy is dating Todd. Todd used to date Ramona. And Neil would like his date with Knives to work out tonight. During this time as they all talk and sort of prepare for the gig that evening we are given flashbacks to Scott and Envy's highschool romance; it wasn't much. She dumped him. Then suddenly out of nowhere Scott goes nuts and decides it's time to fight evil boyfriend #3, Todd. Right there and then only problem is he loses since Todd is vegan and has special vegan powers. Well this leads to other stuff and the book finally ends with Scott (not so) looking forward to evil boyfriend #4. I couldn't get into the book this time. Ramona, who I like best, just didn't do much. Scott is certainly not on any sort of track to improve himself at this stage and I think that would be wishful thinking on my part, by this point. The fight scenes were really very dumb so I didn't even enjoy the video game aspect of it this time around. I'm not trashing the book though. It did keep the plot going, kept all the characters involved, had a few good one-liners and at the back of the book Bryan Lee O'Malley includes a small list of his favourite manga at the time. I'd read one series already (and loved it) so I looked up the others and found one to add to my ""want to read"" list Berserk by Kentaro Miura.",Nicola Mansfield
9781934964101,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. This was the worst book in the series for me. It's Scott's 24th birthday and he has matured a bit like I wanted him to over the course of these books. At least he's no longer using girls and being a major jerk, though he is still a jerk. Ramona's behaviour is suddenly all out of character and she appears to just disappear. o..kay?... Anyone doing the math is not surprised to know that this book's boyfriend will have to be twins, otherwise how do we get 7 evil boyfriends out of 6 books; as any videogamer knows the last one is going to be reserved for the Boss. So no surprise there. The battle scene was very low key and seemed as if the author had actually gotten tired of the whole evil boyfriend plot himself! While fighting, this Japanese duo seemed to have much more fun dishing the dirt on Ramona to Scott than actually winning the fight. Not all characters appear in this volume and some only make cameo appearances; the book highly concentrates on Scott, Ramona and Kim. Scott has a rendezvous with Gideon, the last evil boyfriend, the Boss, the one behind all this madness, who has all the answers; by the volume's end. This sets up the final book but doesn't leave me excited in anyway. Though I've lost my get-go for this series, with only one more book to go till journey's end I will be reading the final volume soon.",Nicola Mansfield

9781620100004,"Reason for Reading: I've really paid no attention to the hype about this series, never seen the movie, nor do I know what it's even about. But I did intend to give it a try someday, seeing as the author is Canadian and since I had the chance decided now was the time. I didn't *love* this and at first wasn't even all that lukewarm to it either but as the book progressed I became more interested in Scott and then eventually Ramona, until at the end I knew I would read the next book. I was put off with all the h*m*s*xual references and jokes. Is that all a gay character is for? Of course, the lifestyle of these 23-25 year olds was not what I would call edifying either. The publisher recommends this for ages 13+ but I personally give it a recommended 18+. Any 13 year old of mine won't be reading about young 20 year olds going to bed with each other. There is one highschool student in the book (a 17yo) but she is brought into the college/young adult world. Not a book for children, imho. Once I got over this stuff, and got used to it, as I did think this was going to be a book about and for highschoolers, I found myself getting attached to Scott Pilgrim and several of the other characters such as Kim and Ramona at this point. The story is quite out there with a video game theme whereby Scott has to defeat Ramona's past 7 evil boyfriends to win the right to date her. In fact there is a lot of little bitty ""out there"" references that are made and plot points that happen so the reader, especially this one, became more and more intrigued the further she reads on. When I first started, I couldn't see myself really liking this book, but now that I'm finished I certainly want to read next book! The colour was nice but I don't want to wait that long to read them all so I will continue on with the black & white editions.",Nicola Mansfield
9780142401200,"First off: The book is superb! Secondly: The author [Ellen Raskin] is nothing less than a genius writer! Third: Nobody would have seen the ending coming, if it slapped you in the face! As I stated above, the author is just amazing in how she organized the book and made all the characters so different from each other, yet they all can be classified as ""normal enough"" (for the most part anyways). Yet in their own way, all the people were a bit puzzling. Ellen definitely has her own unique writing style and it is clear to see that she took her time to ponder on this storyline (and it's for the better that she did). Okay, enough about the author! Let me tell you a bit about the storyline: Samuel Westing (AKA ""Uncle Sam""--because he was a very patriotic man) has been located in his mansion.... DEAD. Everyone who was in his will were all (coincidentally, of course) invited to check out the apartments in Sunset Towers (which weren't even towers). Also, (again coincidentally) all members-of-the-will accepted the apartments (of course the surprise of finding out that they are in this man's will, would come after they move in). Anyways, when they finally come together to read the will... all 16 heirs are in for a real shocker! The will turns out to be this clever puzzle they have to solve. There's 8 teams and each team only gets 2 clues, so they'll do anything to peek over someone's shoulder to find new clues staring them in the face. Oh! And did I mention that whoever figures out the answer to the puzzle first, will win $200 million? Yeah, sorry if I forgot to mention that. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: You just have got to read this book! It's one of those stories that once you start it, there's no way you can think of anything else, until you finish the book (and yes, I'm talking about the VERY last page!)",Tarissa
9780142401095,"THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC by Jane Yolen is required reading at my school, as it is in many middle/junior high schools across the country. I've been meaning to read it for several years but never did, until my son read it this year as an eighth grader. He insisted I read it. How could I resist that? Hannah is celebrating Passover Seder with her family. It's the same thing every year. Grandpa will get all worked up over old photos on TV, shaking his fist, screaming about the numbers on his arm, and Aunt Eva will calm him down as she always does, laying a hand on his arm, leading the same old Jewish prayers as Hannah mumbles along. But this year will be different. Hannah's brother, Aaron, will get to hide the afikoman, Hannah will get to taste real wine, and then she'll get to open the door to symbolically welcome in the prophet Elijah. But when she opened that door, she had no idea just how different this year's celebration would be. Instead of seeing the hallway in front of her as she expected, she sees a man coming her way, crossing a field. Confused, she turns back to her family and instead sees a strange woman, dressed even more strangely, kneading dough on a wooden table. Hannah's confusion grows as she hears herself referred to as Chaya, and discovers that these two people believe themselves to be her Aunt Gitl and Uncle Shmuel. More unbelievably, they talk about her parents' deaths, and that she herself had nearly died, sick for weeks. Feeling like she's in a dream she can't wake up from, she finds herself pulled into wedding festivities, which includes walking to a nearby village for the celebration. There, her dream turns into a nightmare. Hannah is slowly disappearing as Chaya is loaded onto trucks with the other villagers. Then, later, they are prodded like cattle aboard boxed railroad cars with no ventilation, and they travel, standing, for four days and nights without food or bathrooms. What follows is days, weeks, maybe months, in a Jewish concentration camp. Jane Yolen's telling of the Holocaust is chilling. She gathered information from survivors, those heroes who remember so that the atrocities of the past will never happen again. Ms. Yolen writes in her final pages to the reader, ""That heroism - to resist being dehumanized, to simply outlive one's tormentors, to practice the quiet, everyday caring for one's equally tormented neighbors. To witness. To remember. These were the only victories of the camps."" This book is incredibly powerful. The way Ms. Yolen weaves the past and present together forces the reader to make personal connections. She makes the reader think and ask questions. How could society have allowed such a thing to happen? And, more importantly, how can we assure that it will never happen again? I truly hope THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC will remain required reading in schools. Each new generation must bear the weight of those lost souls upon their heart. They must believe that such devastating events can, and did, happen. Only in believing and remembering can we move forward to a better society. Thank you, Ms. Yolen, for this riveting and thought-provoking book. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

They visit the world's first space hotel, but the astronauts who are shuttling the staff to the hotel, and everyone on earth watching the proceedings, including President of the United States Lancelot R.

Who are the invaders? Where did they come from? Will Charlie and his friends escape or will they be gobbled up by the aliens? Roald Dahl has written some good books and some not-so-good ones. James and the Giant Peach and Fantastic Mr. Fox are all right but nothing to write home about. The Vicar of Nibbleswick is not among my favorites. And Mathilda is one with which I definitely have some objections. However, I really liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It was a fun story that also illustrated some good principles. Sequels are seldom as good as the originals, and that is the case here. It seems as if Dahl was pressed to provide a follow-up and did so without a real cohesive theme. Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is certainly not a bad book, and most kids will probably like it. A few common euphemisms (heck, golly, gee) occur; the phrase ""O my lord"" is used once as an interjection; the Nanny-Vice-President sings of the President, ""I used to sit him on the pot and wait for him to wee;"" and there is a reference to drinking gin. Otherwise, it is a somewhat silly children's tale, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with that. But it is a bit disconnected and lacks much of the charm of its predecessor.",Wayne S. Walker

9780141187761,"Widely regarded as one of the most influential books of all time, George Orwell's haunting science-fiction thriller Nineteen Eighty-Four will have you gripped up to the final page. From the start you are plunged into the tormented life of working-man Winston Smith, following his path of love, rebellion and betrayal. Orwell unravels the story bit-by-bit, following Smith's first-person narrative and giving the reader his own anxious captivation. Living under constant surveillance by Big Brother, one must wait - almost agonisingly - until the right moment arrives to unearth the next piece of the mystery. Every character is shrouded in uncertainty, every action builds the tension, and you will often find yourself reading the next chapter before you've finished the last. George Orwell's heavily political subtext will not appeal to all readers. It does require some understanding of political movements to understand the intentions of the all-seeing Party. Nevertheless, this is not essential to understand the situation Smith is in, and the feelings he has. Nineteen Eighty-Four is truly a revolutionary piece of literature, and its impact is clear to see from the neologisms which sprouted from it, such as Orwellian, Room 101, thought-crime, and of course: Big Brother.",James Lovatt

Blanche DuBois takes a break from her life and pays a visit to her sister Stella and her husband in New Orleans. There, Blanche will deal not only with her own problems but also with her sister's marital troubles and what the early 20th century society regarded as ""proper"" for both single and married women. With a fierce social critique, Williams manages to create one of the best and most interesting female characters of the last century, comparable only to other great literary heroins such as Lady Chatterley and Madame Bovary. In fact, the greatness of this character has recently attracted the attention of two Academy Award-winning actresses (Rachel Weisz and Cate Blanchett) who could not help to portrait the brilliant Blanche in two different productions, in London and in NYC. ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" makes an amazing and deep, yet easy, reading not only for women but anyone interested in good literature, classic works, drama or, to put it simply, life in general.",Elena

Believing that the FBI investigation could not trace them they moved freely till their arrest and trial.

9780141191454,"This short novel belongs in the same league as J D Salinger's Catcher in the Rye and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mocking Bird. Yes, it's really that good. Mary Katherine (Merricat) Blackwood introduces herself with what has to be one of the most stylistically perfect paragraphs in American literature. She tells us, amongst other things, that she likes her sister Constance, Richard Plantagenet and the death cap mushroom, and regrets that she was not born a werewolf. Without flagging in interest or style, she continues over succeeding pages to relate the events of five weeks in her life one New England spring, in doing so gradually revealing how it came about that all of her family other than Constance are dead. The villagers (""The people of the village have always hated us."") believe it was Constance who one day put arsenic in the family sugar bowl. Constance was put on trial, but acquitted for lack of evidence. She had taken care to wash the bowl before the police arrived. After the trial, Constance and Merricat establish a life of reclusive domesticity in the family mansion. Notwithstanding taunts from the villagers that Connie may try to poison her, Merricat is happy and fears only that their way of life may be changed. Enter Cousin Charles, who has designs on Constance and the family fortune. Merricat's response exacts a terrible price, yet proves a solution of sorts. In this edition, the afterword by Joyce Carol Oates is interesting and useful , but should definitely be read afterwards, not before, by those who are not already familiar with the story and don't want foreknowledge of how the mystery unfolds.",Andrew Sheppard

9780141182797,"I originally reviewed it on my booklikes page http://aniashuk.booklikes.com/post/117420/holly-holly- Capote's most loved and well-known novella, first published in November, 1958, tells us about Holly, Holly Golightly (yes, I think that this woman might have been awesome James Bond, if she had been alive:) - exceptional woman with mazy past, outstanding present and you-won't-know-it future, through eyes and words of unnamed writer, who was her neighbor and friend. Once in NY... ""It may be normal, darling; but I'd rather be natural."" I really liked this novella! It was quick and fun read, full of captivating writing and characters, that made this book a treasure for me. Holly is SOMETHING! Very extraordinary character, multi-faceted, with story absolutely amazing personality. Until now, I've decided not to hang those ""And now THIS is my favourite classic"" or ""Move, Gatsby!"" labels on classic books, especially since I've not read a lot of classic in past, and every newly read good one can become my next ""I love it!"" one. Chic! This book is posh! Short, but such a significant story! Magnifique! Holly Golightly is a young woman, with heart of girl and mind of lion. She had a difficult past, that made her become a woman from an early age (well, for me it's early, but I won't tell you the age, spoiler free territory here), withstand different situations, fight for her future (believe me, I'm not over-dramatizing here, it's short part of the book, but turn up logic&imagination and you'll see, what I mean) and made herself a name in middle 40's NY society, that tells a lot about a small-town girl. OK, I really don't want to spoil the book and it seems like I'm starting to do it...So I'll stop here. I'll simply give you some quotes, that can pull a curtain for you a little: ""If I could find a real-life place that made me feel like Tiffany's, then I'd buy some furniture and give the cat a name."" ""Leave it to me: I'm always top banana in the shock department."" ""The blues are because you're getting fat or maybe it's been raining too long. You're sad, that's all. But the mean reds are horrible. You're afraid and you sweat like hell, but you don't know what you're afraid of. Except something bad is going to happen, only you don't know what it is."" ""You're wrong. She is a phony. But on the other hand you're right. She isn't a phony because she's a real phony. She believes all this crap she believes. You can't talk her out of it."" The storyteller himself wasn't a big deal for me. He's actually a dull spot, comparing to Holly, more like a background or messenger. But Capote's writing gave him a favor, so you can imagine yourself sitting with him in some bar in NY and listening to story, that you won't forget. And in the end, you'll wish you could know that woman in person. As always, when it comes to a good book, READ IT! I'm sure you'll enjoy this pure gold of classic literature.

9780141189383,"Alone in Berlin, takes place during the 2nd world war, with Germany firmly under the Nazi jackboot. Because of the constant fear of arrest by the Gestapo, with the threat of imprisonment, torture and death Berlin was a miasma of paranoia, fear and suspicion. In a world where a family member, neighbour or complete stranger can denounce you for a crime imagined or otherwise and even if you're not condemned to death, you'll find yourself classified an enemy of the state, ostracized and unable to find employment. Otto and Anna Quangel, are a working class couple, who were not interest in politics, and although they weren't members of the National Socialist German Worker's Party, they had tacitly supported Hitler, even voted for him. This was all to change - when one day a letter arrived, telling them their son had died a ""hero's death for F 1/4 hrer and Fatherland"". This shocks them out of their apathy and they start a campaign that explicitly questions Hitler and his regime, writing on postcards messages such as: ""Mother! The F 1/4 hrer has murdered my son. Mother! The F 1/4 hrer will murder your sons too, he will not stop till he has brought sorrow to every home in the world."" These cards were then left in the stairwells of apartment blocks, in locations all over Berlin, or dropped into post boxes. It wasn't long before they caught the attention of the Gestapo. This takes takes the form of inspector Escherich, who is mapping the position of every card with the aim of pinning down the ""criminals"". This being Nazi Germany, Escherich himself is constantly under pressure to get results or face the direst consequences: harried & abused by Obergruppenf 1/4 hrer Prall, the inspector will try any trick - dirty or otherwise to catch the postcard writers. Although the postcards aren't really successful, because the population is so terrified that they hand them straight to the Gestapo, or destroy them, the cards offend the authorities and the case becomes serious and failure to solve it is not an option and it's just a matter of time before the Quangels become guests of the hellhole that is the Gestapo prison system and then it becomes a question of not will they survive, but how they die. Alone in Berlin was originally called Every Man Dies Alone and was based on the true story of Otto and Elise Hampel a working class couple from Berlin, who came up with the idea of leaving postcards around their city denouncing Hitler and his regime. They got away with it for about two years, but were eventually discovered, denounced, arrested, tried and executed - beheaded in Berlin's PlPtzensee Prison in April 1943. Hans Fallada was given the Hampel's Gestapo files by Johannes Becher, a writer friend of Fallada's, who was president of the cultural organization established by the Soviet military administration in the Soviet sector, with the aim of creating a new anti-fascist culture. Sometimes you pick up a book that so engrosses you, that despite it's subject matter you cannot leave it alone. You know that there will be no traditional happy ending for Otto and Anna Quangel, that respect for humanity is not high on the Gestapo's list of priorities, that it is when and not if they are caught and then that they will face every form of torture from humiliation to being treated like a rag doll in the mouth of a rabid dog. None of this matters, or more accurately despite all of it, this book is beautiful, a quiet book of common decency, that reaches beyond the subject matter to reach a grandeur that, although of a tragic nature, still lights up bright enough to shine through the deepest of hellholes and to depict in letters large enough to be seen from the stars stating that despite all evidence to the contrary the human spirit and decency is never ever totally destroyed.",parrish lantern

9780141182858,"Rhys wrote this as a response to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (Wordsworth Classics), wanting to re-position the character of Mrs Rochester, the ""mad woman in the attic"", into a primary position, rather than being voiceless and without any expressed identity of her own, as in Charlotte Bronte's story. Rhys does this by setting her story prior to the events in Jane Eyre; effectively the novella is a prequel to the latter. Most importantly, she prioritises the white Creole, Antoinette - her original name: in Jane Eyre we know her only as the mysterious madwoman in the attic, until later, she is explained as being Bertha, the first Mrs Rochester. As a result, her character in 'Sargasso', being placed front and centre, creates an entirely different set of interpretations and emphases, not least that Antoinette achieves her own identity and humanity here, rather than being relegated into a prison space of madness and silence, one in which Mr Rochester himself was responsible for. This is a powerful, deeply haunting and hallucinatory, deeply poeticised novella (the style, in this regard, is reminiscent of Toni Morrison's Beloved (Vintage Classics); it is an original and heartbreaking of love unrequited, leading to madness. The story is split into three parts, the first set in Jamaica, from the viewpoint of Antoinette as a child and in her youth, living on her plantation; the second section in Dominica, regarding the marriage and written both from Mr Rochester's imperialist viewpoint and sense (he only marries her as an arrangement established by his father to gain Antoinette's sizeable dowry and land), and Antoinette's increasingly troubled self (she knows that Rochester has had a sexual relationship with one of the female servants, while being with her); all the while you experience Rochester's own confusion and increasing disgust with the local people and the way of living, the heat and the tropical intensity of the place, so alien to him from his English, cold viewpoint. And, the third and most dramatic part, in which we once again return to ""Antoinette"", now Bertha, not only abandoned, but left imprisoned - the original ""madwoman in the attic"" - in Rochester's house in England; a world she neither understands nor values, and in which there is no love for her, no interest; she is effectively made persona non grata for all the years she is locked up there. Throughout the story, you experience the intensity of all those involved, the stifling physical environment, you feel the insecurity and uncertainty of the prescribed gender roles between Antoinette and Mr Rochester, and the locals, including servants. There is no ultimate exit or freedom for the female; for the male, there is simply the repetition of the male-dominated power structure, such that it deprives the male of any real identity, beyond that of his family's expectations and a prescribed role for his own masculinity and authority. 'Sargasso' is a powerful read, troubling and passionate, and a unique and profound creative take on issues of identity (especially including Colonial, slave, and the power dynamic between England and the Caribbean), sexuality and madness. It is a fascinating, moving and clever re-interpretation of the story told in Jane Eyre, and is highly recommended.",bobbygw

Waugh's descriptions are long but exquisite, especially those about the setting of the book: Oxford, London and Venice among other places, during the inter-war period. He also included a ton of lovely metaphors and a speck of Latin which gave this story a timeless touch. Also, all the characters (mostly high class) were very vivid and I was emotionally attached to most of them as I shared with them their pain and happiness alike. I was so invested in the main characters' relationships. Lastly I will mention the themes which were brought out in this book. Apart from those of love, friendship, loss and the ills of society by the use of satire, the theme which really stands out is that of Roman Catholicism and morality, which was accentuated by philosophical endeavours of the protagonist.

9780141195650,"Selby has been described as a 'clinician of violence . whose novels have the immediacy of art' (Josephine Hendin, Vulnerable People: A View of American Fiction Since 1945 (A Galaxy book)), which I think is true; likewise, he is a literary master of demonstrating through his characters a moral ugliness, misogyny and despair whose power as a novelist is unmatched and unprecedented in fiction. He is a truly remarkable writer, and, while he wrote six novels in his lifetime, I believe the most powerful and compelling (while not the darkest), remains Last Exit. I cannot recommend it highly enough - it is a genuine work of art, but its power is dark and troubling, so I would likewise highly recommend you stay clear of this novel if you find yourself in a depressed frame of mind. Controversy has always surrounded Selby, Jr.'s writing. From the start, with Last Exit (being his first novel), his original UK publisher Calder and Boyers, faced prosecution in the UK in 1967, under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act. It was a major trial, especially because while it was originally found guilty of being 'obscene', the Appeal in 1968 overturned that decision and paved way for a much more open-minded interpretation of literature as to merit. In some interviews, and in one introduction to the novel that he wrote, Selby himself said that when he was writing this novel (six years in the making), he 'was aware of the rage and anger within' (quoted from the QPB edition in 1994). He also acknowledged that, while he has no favourite among his novels, he singles out The Room, and then this novel, notably, because through it he 'truly did learn how to write' (quote from same QPB edition). Set in New York in the late 1950s, the story grabs you from the start, conveying an incredibly raw, visceral, yet always disturbingly poetic quality throughout. It is superb for its genuine grittiness, horribly grim reality and ugliness of modern inner city life - of thought, attitude, action and feeling - both projected outwards, as well as internalised, all of which is captured through numerous voices of the dispossessed, alienated, disenfranchised. Selby is in the tradition of naturalist/realist fiction, but he goes a significant step further, in that, often through his first-person character narratives/viewpoints, he achieves an hallucinatory quality whose intensity strengthens the realities he conveys. One critic, James R. Giles, in his excellent study of Selby's works, Understanding Hubert Selby, Jr. (Understanding Contemporary American Literature), wrote 'It is true that, while all the characters in the novel are victimized by a brutal environment, they are guilty of moral failures that make their victimization complete and irrevocable', and this is done by Selby's exploring without fear or judgement powerful themes that resonant as much today as they did on first publication in 1964 in the US: drug addiction, misogyny, violence of rape and beatings, prostitution, the relentless drudgery and alienation of most jobs as well as unemployment, without value or meaning and life in general that is suffused with hate and a distressingly dark, twisted humour (when not expressed through seething resentment or explosive anger). I reckon, Dante would have regarded Last Exit as a worthy match to his own vision of Hell - especially through characters who represent the sick underbelly of the city: self-deluding, beaten-up prostitutes, incredibly violent youths and gangs, a desperately lonely, elderly woman who has no life other than pathetic memories of her dead husband and son, among others. As for disturbing, truly dark humour, one such example will give you a powerful sense of it: at one point, two women sitting chatting on a bench in a miserable New York housing project, joke about and look forward with sick, twisted glee to the prospect of a baby - crawling on an upper-storey tenement window-ledge - falling to its death: they're disappointed that it is saved in the nick of time). In particular, the lives of a handful of individuals are portrayed with great psychological depth, narrated most often from the first-person viewpoint, in a stream-of-consciousness fashion that remains clear, coherent and compelling. These viewpoints capture their desperation, self-loathing, hatred and confusion about themselves and their environments: defiant yet self-deluding Georgette, a hig drag queen who is pathetically in love with Vinnie and convinced she can change him for the better and that he will truly love her; while he himself is a psychopathic and sociopathic gang leader interested in only in sadistic and often instant gratification; Tralala, a violently angry, predatory prostitute who ultimately is destroyed in the most horrifying way imaginable; Harry - interestingly, that name is ubiquitous among male characters in Selby's fiction, acting as a synonym for the type of man who is misogynistic, dispossessed, angry, self-loathing, and self-deluding - who is a trade union leader, loathsome, selfish, arrogant and boring, who is despised or at best tolerated by his co-workers - and, worse, whose misogyny is so genuinely convincing and disturbing, which we hear, being ~inside his head', listening trapped to his banal voice, desperation, loathing and perspective, such that it makes Bateman's misogyny in American Psycho appear not only over the top, but utterly unreal (and never mind Ellis' darkly satirical intentions).",bobbygw

9780141185149,"Primo Levi's writing generally is harrowing and - as strange as it sounds - hauntingly beautiful. This is especially true of his masterpieces, ""If This Were a Man"" and ""The Truce"". It will be very hard to read Levi's books without being left moved by his life experiences and marvel at the same time at the positive courage he showed and the almost surreal sunny disposition he maintained while incarcerated in a Nazi concentration camp. ""The Periodic Table"", in which Levi takes the chemical elements as the inspiration for recounting people and incidents from his life, is also as exquisitely written as his other books. While it is a little less disturbing compared to some of his other works, it is nevertheless not short of some eloquent passages. For instance, while describing how he stole cerium rods from the Lager laboratory, he discusses such a seemingly mundane issue as packaging and observes that ""God.. solved [the problem of packaging] brilliantly... with cellular membranes, eggshells, the multiple peel of oranges, and our own skins..."" However, while lamenting the then non-availability of polyethylene, Levi adds, ""God... although he is a master of polymerization, abstained from patenting it: He does not like incorruptible things.""",VENKAT RAMANAN

I love the way the reader is taken into the killer's mind, following him as he tries to explain things, only to digress as his thoughts take him elsewhere.

I read this book in one sitting as it was impossible to put down. The characters and storyline are gripping and the pacing is perfect. At times it reminded me of certain works by Camus.

9780141184852,"I've never been a fan of the Big Men of postwar American letters - Mailer/Roth/Updike, and for some reason I had put Bellow in the same basket, unread. Eventually some awareness of his cultural importance trickled down to me, and when the blurb on the back of Seize The Day screamed at me: One of the finest short novels in the language, I could resist no longer, and at 120 pages had nothing to lose. Tommy Wilhelm is the prototype of a kind of pathetic male character, infuriatingly impotent, and at whom we laugh uncomfortably, that is near-ubiquitous in modern literature, from Paul Auster to Martin Amis. He inhabits an insular milieu of upper-west Manhattan in the 50s, which I found strange and fascinating - amongst people who live in hotels and spend their days speculating on commodities. Trapped, as he sees it, between an uncaring father and a cruel ex-wife (no-one has ever understood poor Tommy), we witness him being systematically fleeced of his last savings by a metaphysically-inclined grifter, whilst getting a potted biography via his alternately self-pitying and self-loathing interior monologue. Apart from a few city vignettes, some half-baked philosophising, and lots of drinking and pill-popping, this is all we get, but it is enough. Bellow's writing has a visceral quality - of the sweaty pores and dirty sheets variety - that is a pleasing counterpoint to the gentility of his characters and setting. The pithiness of the narrative, it's tone of almost-satire, and concern with the basic pathology of the male psyche, reminded me a lot of Day of the Locust. The con-man's didactic monologues have a tacked-on feel, but overall the narrative is well-controlled and thus makes a powerful impression.

One of Lovecraft's great strengths as a story teller was his vast erudition concerning science, history, astronomy and architecture. Subsequently, his tales often read like non-fiction reports, and Joshi's notes enrich the experience by adding another layer onto the texts, making the distinction between fiction and non-fiction even more nebulous. This volume contains the excellent prose poem Polaris, in which the narrator's dreams and waking life become confused. Longer triumphs include The Dreams in the Witch House and The Shadow Out of Time.

However, after reading two authors, Thomas Ligotti and Jorge Luis Borges, I thought it might be worth re-reading Lovecraft. This book shows me that there is a lot I missed as a teenager. Lovecraft was a voracious reader, and this bonded with his profound imagination. His style at its best has a curious blend of scientific and antiquarian vocabulary which makes it highly fascinating. This volume contains three of his most memorable stories: the title tale and The Festival and The Haunter in the Dark as well as many other excellent tales.

Volume 1 is important because manuscript author, Mildred A. Wirt, sketched Nancy's personality and her relationships with family and strangers alike. She is a sharp investigator and morally decent, at age 18. The title is a spoiler. If an event began with a clock and the journey was about deciphering its contents, the existing title would work. However no clock is mentioned throughout the majority of the pages. It is all about not knowing where important information is. We should be guessing for 180 pages, the location of Josiah Crowley's will. Instead: ""The Secret Of The Old Clock"" blares across the cover! Hmmm.... where could it be? We spend the book waiting for a clock to appear. Tracking an obvious object is not as enthralling as it being the actual mystery. Josiah disliked the Topham family, who might inherit his fortune based on an earlier draft. He agreed to live with them in dwindling years, to be polite. However bringing your belongings to a place you dislike is beyond polite. Most of all, how could there have been any draft; not merely including the Tophams but bequeathing 100% to them? One completely omitting the destitute people he loved? He was a shrewd businessman and would ascertain their ulterior motives in asking him to move in. Later, Nancy visited a lake to explore the Topham's cabin; oddly at her rival's recommendation that their caretaker show her around. Instead of telling Helen she had a mission, she wasted two days acquiescing to camp activities. Also noteworthy, thieves infiltrated two houses with people present. It would make better sense to case empty ones.",C. Riedel
9780448095028,"I've read a few Nancy Drew stories since I was 9, to know others are better than ""The Secret Of The Old Clock"". With the pioneering volume watered down to action scenes and sentences made dull for small children; the superior quality of volume two is impressive. ""The Hidden Staircase"", 1930, demonstrates how a mystery should be done! Diving into the crux is a continuous trademark but there are no irrelevant mishaps to engineer excitement. Every event pertains to the two well-plotted threads and this time, colour is put into the settings and characters along the way. You feel a full-dimensional journey unfold, instead of a stilted jerk from cliff-hanger to cliff-hanger. Helen's aunt and Great-Grandmother consult Nancy about a theft and unexplained occurrences in their locked mansion. Simultaneously, her Dad Carson is threatened by a neighbourhood bitterly selling their properties to a railroad. These are two reasonably serious circumstances for a teenager to take on at once and she muddles through both in a manner that feels realistic; with candour about how stressed out she is. There are no farfetched leaps to solutions, no secret halls are located with any ease, and Nancy isn't thrown into closets or cellars to create a fright factor like in other novels. Hands down, this is the best Nancy Drew I have ever read. Ranking could only be higher if the story were truly paranormal! The reader knows from the start that the girls don't believe a haunting has taken place but dub the intrusion 'the ghost' in good fun. The absence of an actual spectre is what children of the 1970s call 'a Scooby Doo outcome'. On the subject of literary richness, rare for this series: Mildred A. Wirt's description of Nancy's view from the manor roof is an unexpectedly lovely passage.",C. Riedel
9780448095042,"I do believe this is one of my more favorite Nancy Drew mysteries. The story truly had me baffled until the final strings were pulled. After Nancy's friend, Emily Willoughby, has revealed that odd events have been taking place around the inn, Nancy Drew is on the job. But that is not her only problem, because someone in River Heights is actually impersonating Nancy... and getting away with it! How will Nancy cope with all the mysterious occurrences? Better yet, how can she capture her own double?",Tarissa
9780448095042,"I like Nancy Drew but there are better volumes than ""The Mystery At Lilac Inn"". I admire a mystery that weaves back stories together but this isn't one of them. This time the 'Carolyn Keene' publishing committee was obvious. A hodgepodge of culprits were added, in an attempt to pack the book with excitement. The result is that Nancy, Helen, and Emily spent 180 pages on disjointed errands. We're weighted down with a shady waitress and gardener, a rude coordinator, Dick's military buddy... Out of nowhere, there are scuba-diving sessions. Additionally, Nancy has an identity thief at home. There's an actress and an ex-waitress to interview out-of-town, a truck makes minor cameos, and diamonds are stolen. The wonderful old inn and legend of lilac trees could weave a dazzling tale. Instead, keeping Mr. Daly on staff, who sold the establishment to Emily & Dick, was superfluous. Thieves discovered hidden doors from the 1700s that he didn't know of. I readily admit I always hope for a genuine ghost story and the cover suggests one but the shimmering lady scarcely appears. No part of the book is sinister. A bomb destroys Nancy & Helen's cabin in a clear murder attempt but Carson Drew merely cautions his daughter! That violence is out of synch with the hodgepodge that comprises the novel. Nancy's impersonator sought to punish someone the reader received no clues about. It was out of left field. Coincidentally, they also had time to mastermind scaring Emily, even though there was never an alternate resort buyer. The excuse for wanting the property is lame, amounting to stolen goods and a handy shed for hiding them. If the owners sold Lilac Inn, the goods would go with them, or run out. Obtaining a brochure-advertised resort to accommodate smuggling, is a poorly-contrived story.",C. Riedel
9780448095219,"This is an excellent novel by <b>Mildred A. Wirt</b> in 1944, unrecognized as its author for years. Unless pertaining to computers or freedom, I disregard remarks about a story feeling outdated. It would be silly to expect literature or films to accommodate 2012 (and all the years my review gets read). A story is current when it's composed. People shouldn't penalize era of origin in feedback. A man in a declining mansion he can't afford, is raising his Granddaughter, <i>Susan</i>. Her Dad <i>Philip March</i>, a deceased soldier and composer, identified hidden sheet music for his late wife in coded letters. Publishing the songs would bring money <i>Susan</i> and her Grandpa desperately need but some were located and stolen. This sub-plot is weak because one cannot pose as a musician and bring music notes to a radio station, airing a finished product in a week! That's my sole critique: suggesting sheet music is an instant commodity, as accessible and valuable as stealing a key or social insurance number. However if we take the rest as is, this is a compelling mystery. <i>Nancy</i> cons a disliked peer, sneaks into a high security factory, and works on codes. I am always excited by secret compartments and rooms. They are ample here, to heart's content! <i>Nancy's</i> Dad, who is a lawyer, has tremendous respect for her by utilizing her investigative talents on difficult cases. It was also extremely brave for a 20 year-old to glean information from a family she dislikes and to sneak into a rival laboratory after hours. Like <i>""Harry Potter""</i>, don't be dissuaded by the target demographic. I maintain that the most enthralling, suspense-raising mysteries, are those that involve anything except 'a dead body'! Most fiction siphons their plots from a murder. Secrets and clues are far more original and gripping!",C. Riedel

9781908435132,"When i first heard of this book i had no idea that i would like it so much. In the beginning, i found this book a little slow, but as the world began to come together, i couldn't put it down! It is about a boy named Thomas, who comes up The Box to a place called The Glade. He has no memories other then his name, and soon finds out that he is trapped in the middle of The Maze. As the story goes on, the characters try to figure out a way out, who sent them here and who they really are. This take on the dystopian genre is gripping and suspenseful! I loved the amount of detail that the author used, as it gives a great image in mind of the scene. The characters in the book i either loved or hated, and it gave me a great connection with the story. It is one of my favourites without a doubt! Recommended to 12+",Karina

This is one of the biggest YA series out and I??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??ve heard a lot of good reviews about this book, so after watching the movie trailer, I knew it just had to pick it up!

At the beginning of the book there was a lot of information to take in about the maze and I found it a bit hard to keep with it all!

The writing was a little to simplistic and I feel it would have been a greater book if the writing had been better! As for the actual plot, the concept was very interesting and I think the maze was explained pretty well but the outside world is still a mystery but I think that will be developed more in the next book. There was twists I saw coming and there were actually a couple I never saw coming so that was good! And the ending was definitely a great set-up to the next book.

9780141334783,"I absolutely LOVED this book!!!! I was glued to it since I bought it, I started reading it as soon as I got it, and it went everywhere with me until I finished it. It really makes you angry, the thought of how controlling the government could get. The whole story is wonderful, I loved how easily the characters fell into place, it just felt right. My heart was racing the whole last chapter, and I wanted to cry when I finished because I hadn't bought the sequel!

9780141334783,"If it is possible to be both a self-confessed pessimist and a hopeless romantic then that's me. This is perhaps why Matched appealed to me so very much. Matched is a young adult dystopian romance which brings many Orwellian questions home to a younger audience. These days the idea of Big Brother brings to mind a voyeuristic television show where exhibitionists parade around a glaringly bright house, making fools of themselves in hopes of making a quick buck. Thankfully, Condie reminds us what Orwell and Huxley were trying to say with their original dystopian masterpieces. She takes familiar ideas of society being controlled by government indoctrination and propaganda, and manages to rejuvenate them. The pessimist in me thoroughly enjoyed hating the society in which Cassia, the heroine, lives. It is a society which controls where people work, when they die, how many children they have and even who they love. Of course, anyone who has ever had a crush on completely the wrong person, (and surely that's everyone?) knows that love and lust cannot be weighed and measured. It cannot be controlled. Matched provides an interesting love triangle between the three main characters. Cassia and Xander are matched and you are glad that they are! Xander seems like a great guy: a sensible choice. But what teenage girl, what woman, chooses ""sensible"" when shown the option of ""mysterious"" and ""exciting""? Ky provides both and is the proverbial spanner in the works. As a reader I was drawn into this triangle and really felt for Cassia. Because hers is a tough choice! I found myself rooting for both the male leads, especially at first. The underlying conflict of the seemingly ""ideal"" society of Matched, works to beautifully highlight the conflict raging in Cassia's own heart. We live in a world where we are pretty much always on somebody's CCTV, where advertisements corner us from every form of media, and where Internet dating sites tell us that they can ""match"" us to a perfect partner based on deep aspects of our personalities. Matched is a poignant and intelligent book which will leave you both asking questions and positively drooling for the sequel.",Laura Williams
9780141340104,"I was reluctant to continue the 'Matched' series, because I lost the drive to continue it even though I liked the first book a lot. I remember loving the poetic writing style and how beautifully the plot was written out in each chapter. But I learned not to expect the second book will be as good as the first one. And true to my expectations, Crossed by Ally Condie was disappointing. It did have the same poetic writing style and beautiful breezy formatting and plot division. But it was too poetic that I just started getting bored really fast. There was too much inner monologuing and way too much references to actual poems. And eventually, the book felt like it didn't have much substance. The plot continues where the first book left out and follows the characters Cassia and Ky, each getting their own chapters right after each other. I usually loved how some authors like to divide the chapters like that and the way we get to know what's on the mind of both the female and male protagonist. But in this book, I just hated it. And the only thing the book made me feel was impatience because I wanted the book to end! Crossed by Ally Condie is well-written but lacks the plot and factor to keep a reader interested. A good read for the fans of the 'Hunger Games' and 'Divergent'",Najla Qamber
9780142419779,"First of all, I had rather high expectations before I started to read the book. It was praised as one of the best books of the year so I was looking forward to jumping into a highly recommended dystopian novel. It was a nice and fast read, not complicated and enjoyable at several points. As usually I needed about 100 pages to really get into the book, to get used to the structures of the dystopian world. And I have to say that I missed a full, satisfying draft of the society and its structures. We learned about the process of pairing and the different classes and their associated duties and their determined leisure activities, but I missed somehow a clear picture of how the society really works and why. However some aspects in the world building were very authentic and therefore pretty terrifying such as the complete control of the society over its citizens. Imagining someone controlling how much and what I eat, controlling what I????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??m doing all the time and actually organizing my life no matter what I desire to do is intolerable. So the problematic of this kind of society was well elaborated. The plot is from the beginning on light even though it became visible that something disturbing was happening inside the society from page to page. Firstly the reader accompanies Cassia in her daily routine as well as to her matching ceremony. We get to know her and her feelings and make acquaintance with Xander, her matched partner and Ky, a boy who is not a full part of the society as for the pairing process. He is not designated to be matched with someone. Surprisingly after the pairing ceremony Cassia discovers that Ky might be her ideal partner and not Xander and starts to raise to question if the whole system is actually deception. Of course she now falls in love with Ky, which happens too fast in my opinion. This fact kind of degrades the character of Cassia a little, cause it assumes that she is not that profound and sensitiv as I imagined her to be. Nevertheless the books elaborates well the cleavage Cassia has between Xander, who is honestly in love with her and Ky, who is not supposed to be in love with her, but definitely is as well. Cassia chooses Ky and the drama begins. Secret conversations about poetry and art which is prohibited in the community heat their love and in the end we face a drastic problem which makes the maintenance of their secret love impossible. I actually enjoyed the writing style. It was deep and poetic in some points. At other points a little too superficial for my taste, but I guess appropriate for a young adult novel. The different characters with their different voices came out quite good. I think everybody sympathizes more with Ky but I thought that Xander has a stronger character which is somewhat outstanding. All in all only an okay read for me, but for romance lovers of especially the younger kind a wonderful read about love, poetry and limits a society can set you as well as the thought of outbreaking of such patterns. Perfect for teenagers. :) ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/?? 2 of 5 stars",Isabel Lazarovici

9780142419779,"Everyone around the blogosphere seemed to be enthusiastic about Matched so I was really looking forward to read it. Unfortunately I didn't get to like this novel as much as all the Cassie & Ky or Xander fans out there. At first glance Condie created a very interesting setting of a dystopian novel, featuring classical elements and new ones, inhuman and sterile. Citizens are not allowed to show deeper sentimental reactions in public and rarely at home, that they care for someone or something beyond a superficial level. The individual stands back to the society's benefits, and that I can call a successful adaption of a dystopian background to our story around heroine Cassia. What I found most disturbing is the exact controlling of the death date of each citizen. Cassia, the obedient citizen in the beginning, starts questioning the system when a picture of Ky instead of her promised match appears on her monitor. After the mistake, she starts noticing him and tries to understand the true Ky. They spend time together, learn about each other and who they really are. A relation between Cassia, Ky and Xander is obvious, but not really a love triangle as I couldn't see feelings beyond friendship between Cassia and Xander in the beginning. I wish the love story would be a more dominant part of Matched. I am a hopeless romantic and expected this novel to be more specific and detailed when it comes to the rarely featured love scenes. As other novels describe the scene of the lover's meeting vividly, Condie describes a kiss or a hug as a fact and not the act of many different emotions, tastes, smells and feelings coming together. This lack of emotional details and description of romantic scenes, might be attribute to the dystopian character of minimalism when it comes to deeper feelings and meanings or a major sign of Condie's average writing style. The society of Matched is divided into different groups of workers and their complexity of thoughts and actions are reduced to guarantee a simple but secure standard. Condie's writing style is as simple as her created society, it is not my favourite but at least supports the story's character well. One aspect I really liked about Matched is that Ky and Cassia find and interpret old symbols and art in a world that doesn't know their meaning anymore. People have forgotten what a compass or handwriting is and now it is on both of them to turn something so uncommon into their weapon against a meaningless and indifferent government. Surprises are rare as we follow a steady rhythm and the first three hundred pages replay a certain routine. The tide of this novel is low, and I drifted on it slowly from moment to moment. I got an appropriate impression of Cassia's life and her district, but almost felt annoyed by this novel's slow pace always expecting something more spectacular happen on the next page. In the last eighty or so pages speed picked up and I found myself in the middle of action, thinking: ""Dear action, there you are, but why haven't you showed up two hundred pages earlier!?"" THE VERDICT Matched can be described as a light romance with main interest on dystopian setting, so this novel definitely is a recommendable read for fans of dystopian tellings of all stripes. I am going to read the sequel when it comes out, but with much less pre- enthusiasm than I felt toward Matched.",MissPageTurner
9780525423645,"Oh my God... Have you read a book that you just can't stop reading? Can't stop thinking about it? Even dream about it? Matched is definitely that kind of book. At first, it started slow, because the author want us to understand Cassia and her world. Cassia is a naive girl who follows the rules without thinking about it. In her world, divorces doesn't, or cancer, thanks to the Society. Everything in her world is perfect. The Society gives you your food delivered every day at your home, they decide your work, and even the person you are going to be Matched for the rest of your life. They decide when you will marry, and have kinds, and how many of them. It sounds wrong, but thanks to that, everything is perfect. It's not as the world from before, where people do whatever they wanted and nothing worked. People died of cancer or sickness, and suffered. People never knew when they will die. So, Cassia believes in the Society. Why wouldn't you? Besides, it's not so awful as you think. She got to choose her dress for the most important day of her life, when she will finally discover the identity of the person who is going to be her match. But what will happen when her match is someone she knows? When she discover another boy could be her match? And when her heart chose the wrong guy? Cassia started being innocent and ended being independent and intelligent. She wakes up and finally starts to see things different. She begins to wonder, why? Why can they decide their food? Or their partners? Or their work? Or what to do with their free hours!? It's, in the end, a love story, where the protagonists have to fight themselves and everyone else to be together. But it's also more than that, it's about growing up, and discovering your perfect life is all a lie. It's more than original, and I was amazed by the world the author created. It's way more closer to reality that we want to believe, which is scary. Do you know how many people live their lives the way someone else make them? Without even knowing? Or what is worse, knowing? Overall, I was so impressed by this book that I believe you should read it. Everyone should read it. Kids, teenagers, adults. In schools, universities, homes. Everywhere in the world. Really. Go and buy it!",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9780525423645,"In the Society where Cassia grew up, everything was decided for her. The Officials decide where people work, when people will die, even who people will love. But all of this seems right to Cassia. After all, this is all needed in order to live a long, fulfilling life. The Matching ceremony where teens find out who they are matched with is a big deal. And when Cassia's best friend turns out to be her match, she knows that the system works. Until she sees another boy's face flash on the screen for just a split second. And now she is torn between Xander and Ky. One boy will lead her towards the life she's always known - and the other will lead her toward an unknown life of passion. Which path should she choose? Which path WILL she choose? Wow, can you imagine living in a world where everything is decided for you? What you wear, what your job is, who you love, the age that you can have kids by, what you eat, when you die? Ally Condie paints this world in such vivid words that you can perfectly imagine it. And it's slightly creepy. I don't think I would do well in a world where everything is decided for you and you have almost no choices. I really enjoyed all of the characters in the story. I love how Cassia grows so much from the beginning until the end of the story when she is questioning the ways of the Society. And Xander and Ky are both such great guys. Usually in stories where the girl is trying to decide between two boys, I find myself leaning towards liking one boy more than the other. But not so in MATCHED. I think I liked Xander and Ky equally. Neither of them had any bad qualities. If I had one complaint about this book, it's that the middle got a little slow for me. I think it plod along and some of the story could have been told more quickly. That being said, though, the ending definitely left me wondering what happens next. I can't wait for the sequel!

9780525423645,"This book was fantastic! I was drawn in and hooked from page one and couldn't stop thinking about it for days after I finished. I fell completely in love with the story and the characters and I think I'm ready for a re-read already (which I rarely do!) Cassia is a strong female lead that had followed the Society's rules set out for her for her whole life. When she starts falling for Ky, and her Grandfather dies and leaves her something special and forbidden, she starts questioning all those rules. She was funny and flawed, and someone I really connected with. The world created was great as well. The thought of a group of overseers controlling everything you do, what you read, what you eat, who you marry, where you work, is completely terrifying. When it came to a scene where they were incinerating books I almost cried...lol. Overall, this was a thought-provoking, powerful, and very entertaining read that I thoroughly enjoyed.

9780525423645,"Ally Condie if you're out there reading this....will there be a sequel? This book has been talked about and hyped up all over the blogosphere and I couldn't wait to read it for myself. Now that I have I can say I know why it's been talked about at the volume that is has been. I loved it! Well, I loved it if there's a chance for a sequel, if this is a stand alone I'm very sad and without getting into spoiler zones that's all I can say. Because I'd never read any of Condie's previous works I wasn't sure what to expect, but after reading her work you can't help but see she has a talent for this type of career in spades. The dystopian world she created in Matched is very unique and terrifying, and at the same time it's of course strangely fascinating. The idea of having the Society select your perfect match for each individual sounded like such a romantic idea to me at first. Condie describes the events leading up to the matching and the characters are all so excited and nervous, it was incredibly suspenseful. After a while though, the romantic aspects of the situation fade and the controlling nature of the act presents itself. Boo to the Society! Condie kept with the typical elements and key components necessary for a dystopian novel but at the same time she was able to make it very much her own. The struggle Cassia goes through as she realizes that her perfect life may not be so perfect after all is very sad. She's not alone of course but here is where I may not agree with other readers. Cassia struggles with her feelings for two different boys and her love for both of them is poignant. I was kind of rooting for one boy and I'm thinking there's a good chance the majority will be rooting for the other. Only time will tell but you'll have to pick up the book to see for yourself who you think is right for Cassia and what you think she should do about all of it.

Oh Xander ... what can I say about how wonderful he was?! Ky was a great guy too. His life had been difficult, but he showed his strength with his devoted love to Cassia. Cassia learned new things about herself and her society. I enjoyed watching her progress. My only complaint would be that it felt slow at times, but I understand that not every book can be all action and romance. I have to say that this is the BEST ending to any series I've ever read! I've never been more happy with the ending of a series. Their lives at the end were definitely not perfect, but I felt that everything worked out like it should.

9780141333069,"Welcome to a world where the Society chooses everything for you. From your future job to who you are going to marry. This is the world that Cassia, our main character lives in, and a world in which she is trying to figure out. What I'm trying to figure out is the book. And I read it at the end of November. Crossed basically picks up where Matched finished, with Cassia heading to the Outer Provinces to try and find Ky. The novel itself, for most of the time, plays out like some version of Cat and Mouse, with Cassia determined to find Ky and finding Rebellion/Uprising, and Ky determined not get killed and find Cassia, and the Society trying to make sure that neither of them succeed. For me personally, Crossed was a disappointing read. Where Matched outlined and showed us a world that was thought perfect but in fact was utterly flawed, Crossed seems like writing that was, if I can put it, half-heartedly done. Most of the time, the novel was spent either in the Outer Provinces or in the Carving, where there was little else to do but run, walk and discuss poetry and paintings. The jumping of point of views between Cassia and Ky became muddled into one, meaning you spent most of the time going, ""Hold on, whose head are we in now?"" While Condie definitely has a way with words, and in using symbolism and ideal such as the 100 Paintings or Poems to convey messages across (for example the use of the Dylan Thomas poem), the novel definitely lacked something - substance. All the characters felt weak and almost uncared for, and as for their own personal development, nothing really happened for Cassia and Ky. The book finished very abruptly, like if you had just run into a wall. The most intriguing part of the book was a plot twist involving one member of the love triangle. In saying all this, the reason I gave the book three stars on Goodreads is because one thing I will give to Condie is how simplistic Cassia and Ky's love for each other is. Especially when you are reading it. While most YA novels go for the full out shivers and chill running down your spine during a romantic scene, Condie keeps it...well, simple. It's very much like Regency England times - it's all in the touch, the look. Which I think is an amazing - and unique - way of portraying the love these two characters share for each other. Overall, Crossed seemed like a read that could have been way much better than it was. I'm still looking forward to seeing what this series brings, but it better bring it good.",Hannah

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to THE MANHATTAN PROJECTS , by Jonathan Hickman! ____________________________________ Weird science, historical conspiracies larger than life, parallel dimensions, worlds colliding, races clashing in and out of our world??????C/???????| A story (inside History) of such absurd proportions could only have been written in comic form by one man: Jonathan Hickman. The writer is all the rage nowadays within the superhero scene because, after leaving behind a long lived and acclaimed run in the Fantastic Four , he was commissioned to take charge of the Avengers franchise with the start of the Marvel NOW! initiative. There he orchestrated Infinity which, last summer, was the most successful comic event of the publisher in recent years. But we??????C/??re not here today to talk about the more mainstream Hickman, but his devotion and consummate dedication to science-fiction in his indie projects: in Pax Romana (published as a complete author), the Vatican funded a military time-travel to the 4th century AD to strengthen the Roman Empire and avoid the Islam supremacy in the present; in Transhuman (with J. M. Ringuet), a mockumentary shows us a future in which humans are genetically engineered by rival companies seeking to manipulate the market with the excuse of building a better world; A Red Mass for Mars (with Ryan Bodenheim), facing a threat from outer space that promises to destroy humanity, recounts the last days of planet Earth; in The Red Wing (with Nick Pitarra) we return to a future in which fighter pilots not only master the air, but also time; and East of West (with Nick Dragotta) presents us with a sci-fi western in a dystopian future. It is not difficult to see a pattern: interest in evolution and the future, passion for conspiracies and the power of cults and religions, emphasis on probing the causes and consequences of the decline of human beings as the dominant species??????C/???????| always spiced with a seemingly unstoppable threat that accelerates the motivations of his characters and the plot itself. All this can be found, one way or another, in The Manhattan Projects . Accompanied again by the peculiar style of Nick Pitarra, a mix of realism and exaggeration (the ideal partner for Jonathan Hickman), an unkempt stroke with great attention to detail, cartoonish but overflowing with imagination, and all this, once again, colored by the always professional, and current star in her field, Jordie Bellaire. By their side, Hickman rewrites a History filled with each and every concern of his as a writer. In The Manhattan Projects , the great threat that acts as a catalyst of the story would obviously be World War II, although there??????C/??s a catch this time: under the guise of funding the Manhattan Project (singular; the atomic bombs that would end the war with Japan), those responsible for the nation??????C/??s defense put up a scientific program which, pluralizing the Project, will lead humans to discover what is ??????C/??out there??????C/??. So, what is the real catalyst? The Cold War, still in the shadows. The confirmation of extraterrestrial presence through the Tunguska event, in 1907, led the Soviet Union to be the first to make contact with aliens and build technology from what they found there. But the Americans had already discovered an interdimensional passage before the Roswell incident in 1947. The solution? A secret alliance to fight for the stars as the Cold War becomes a pantomime between politicians. Pure unadulterated Hickman. As you may have learned from my exposition, Hickman is very comfortable in both the genre and the subjects he brings to the table here, so if you knew previous works by the writer in this field, you can take them as reference. However, it is important to highlight a certain recoverable aspect of this book: beyond the ominous speeches and the ambience of pretended epic often featured in Jonathan Hickman??????C/??s works, what must be noted in The Manhattan Projects , as I wanted to imply in the introduction, is the fun and humor that permeate the entire book. Black, absurd, unintended??????C/???????| There is room for all kinds of humor without the story suffering for it at all, and sometimes even being reinforced. And this is because Hickman has created an absolutely brilliant roster of supporting characters, which are actually protagonists, since this is a completely choral book. Each and every one of them have (or will have) the time to shine, but perhaps in this first volume the one who does it more brightly is *Joseph* Robert Oppenheimer, given the personality (and I will say no more) the writer graces him with. In short, we face yet another work that is a worthy representative of the concerns and interests of its creator, Jonathan Hickman, so it may not be pleasing to those who do not connect with the writer. But The Manhattan Projects would be perhaps the most accessible and less convoluted of his proposals, unleashing pure and not-so-simple fun, full of B-movie sci-fi winks, and a humor so diverse that smiling is inevitable for any comics fan. Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnesses to Jonathan Hickman's most wholly satisfying work of recent times??????C/???????| And in the next volume: Franklin Delano Skynet!

You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time"" First of all I just want to say, I LOVED this book! 5/5 stars! Highly recommend to people who like dystopian, as this is one of the best dystopian's I've ever read. Let's start with the plot. It is told from dual perspective by Day and June. I felt this really helped the reader understand the different parts of the dystopian world, the poor and the rich. It was steady-paced in my opinion which allowed me to familiarize with this new world and appreciate the character's developments. However most of the plot twists I had already guessed and nothing was surprising but that did not stop me from loving this book or enjoying the plot! Onto the characters, let's start with Day because I preferred his perspective over June's. Day was my favourite character, he was loyal, smart, a survivor and in some points in the book there's mentions of his generosity when it comes to other people. Then there's June who I believe had the most character development throughout the book. At first she is snobby, cocky and a bit irritating but she turns out to be a strong heroine who is very smart and independent with a vulnerable side. Other side characters, I loved Tess she was a little sweetheart, I hated all the people in the government except June's brother I liked what we saw of him. I have mixed feelings on the romance, I have no idea why but I prefer Day with Tess because I didn't feel like they have a sibling bond thing between them and they just it each other well. However it doesn't bother me the relationship between Day and June, I'm not really interested in it. As I said before I highly recommend this book to everyone and I cannot wait to read the next one!",brookexx
9780141339603,"(Source: Purchased on kindle from Amazon.co.uk for PS2.99.) 15-year-old Day is a wanted criminal. His own mother believes him dead, and his only friend is a girl who he met on the streets. When his youngest brother is diagnosed with the plague though, Day knows that it's up to him to steal the cure from the hospital for him, no matter what it takes. 15-year-old June is an orphan, and her older brother Metias is her only living relative. June is a child prodigy, the only person ever to score a perfect 1500 on 'the trial' - a test that every 10 year old must go through. Metias is a captain in the military, and June can't wait to join him, until disaster strikes and Metias is killed. Now June is making it her mission to find the boy who killed her brother and make him pay, and her sights are set firmly on Day. Did Day really kill Metias though? Can Day save his brother and escape with his life? And what will happen when June and Day finally meet? This was an enjoyable dystopian story, and I liked the suspense as the story progressed. Day and June were both likeable characters, and both cared deeply for their respective families. I liked the way that both had strong ideas about right and wrong, and both cared enough to stick their necks out when they felt the situation required it. I liked the storyline, and liked the way that Day and June became acquainted with one another. I was quite shocked when it was revealed that Metias was dead as I wasn't expecting it at all, although there were other things that I did manage to predict. I don't think there was a lot of romance in this one though, the storyline mainly focused on June and Day individually. There was quite a lot of suspense in this one though, waiting for June and Day to meet, wondering what will happen when they do, and wondering how it will all end! I did like the ending, and I am looking forward to reading the next in the series, I have a feeling that I will probably need to read books 2 and 3 quite close together though so I may wait to read Prodigy when book 3 is released. Overall; an enjoyable and suspenseful dystopian. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780141339603,"First of all I'd like to thank Lindsey from Puffin books for sending me this paperback copy to read and review. I had heard good things about this dystopian novel so I was really excited to be offered the chance to read it. Second of all I'd like to say wow! This is such a gripping read, I was hooked after just a few pages and from then on I struggled to put it down. I found it really easy to visualise everything that was happening, it felt like I was reading a movie. The story is set in an America of the future, no longer The United States it is a very dark and different world to the one we know today. Plagues, wars and children being forced to take trials that will affect the rest of their lives are just some of the horrors that this future world has to endure. Controlling all of this is a government full of secrets and corruption, it's no wonder there are people who attempt to fight against them to discover the truth. This brings me onto Day - handsome, brave and desperately seeking justice for the wrongs that have forced him away from his family. I loved his use of the word 'goddy', this is now one of my new favourite words! June is intelligent and also brave, you can really sense her feelings of loss and confusion as she struggles to figure out who she can and can't trust. The story alternates between Day's and June's point of view, they are both strong characters who are not afraid of danger and this made for such an exciting read. My heart was literally pounding with fear for them whenever they got into tricky situations. When Day first meets June he has no idea who she really is and vice versa. You could tell that there was a connection between them which would obviously complicate things for them both and I couldn't wait to see how they would react when they found out each other's true identity. I did keep forgetting that they were only fifteen because they both seemed very mature, I think perhaps the events of their childhood are responsible for this and in my opinion this would explain their maturity. The last few chapters were really tense and had me on the edge of my seat, there were a few shocks and some really sad moments that all added to the emotional atmosphere of the book. This was an engaging, action-packed story that I couldn't get enough of - I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.",Kate Verrier
9780141339603,"I was very excited to read Legend as I'm a huge fan of the ideas behind dystopian stories and this one has had rave reviews. I did enjoy it, but unfortunately not as much as I'd expected to. Saying that, the book was entertaining enough, had several good points to it and I would still like to read the sequel. I believe that the film rights to this book have been bought, and I do think that it has a very cinematic feel, maybe making this better off as a film. Legend is set in the urban setting of futuristic Los Angeles and follows two protagonists, Day and June. There is a war in America and Day and June are on opposite sides. June is a prodigy, a soldier who works with the Republic. Day leans more towards the Patriot side, he is a Robin Hood character who steals from the rich to give to the poor. He is also the most wanted person in the Republic. There is a plague that is ravaging the country and has infected Day's family. There is a lot more to the plague than a simple virus outbreak though, and several people come to realise this throughout this book. Whilst attempting to steal a plague cure, Day is accused of killing June's brother. June then makes it her mission to capture Day. The plot itself is interesting and there is a lot more to still be explored in the sequels to this book. I don't think that the plot was anything particularly new, at least not so far, but it'd be unfair to judge that just from the first instalment. There were quite a few similarities to other Dystopian books out there. The world building could've been stronger - The setting wasn't terribly clear and I would've liked to know more about the two sides at war and exactly why, but again, there is room for exploration of this. Lu does start to hint at some reasoning by the end of this book, which makes me anticipate the second book to really see what's going on. For me, the strongest aspect of this book were both Day and June. They both seemed to be strong characters and well formed. Day was loyal, brave and compassionate and June was a brave, self-determined character. I thought that they were both very likeable. Despite both having different views and upbringings, they were morally quite similar. They were also both logical and clever, though I think that they jumped to conclusions too often. I felt that the way that they worked things out so quickly and without much evidence sometimes weakened the book. Whilst we didn't learn all that much about other characters, including Tess (Day's friend), Matias (June's Brother) and Day's family, I thought that they were very solid and intriguing. What I didn't like about Day and June was the insta-love. As soon as they met, they seemed to fall in love, which seemed unrealistic and felt a little 'lazy'. There was certainly potential for chemistry between the two characters, and I did see some as they interacted. I do like the two characters though, and together they did work well. The fact that their relationship was forbidden added to the suspense. I do look forward to seeing how their relationship progresses later on. Legend is an action packed and reasonably fast paced book that I think the majority of young adults will enjoy. If you like a lot of action and perhaps a 'thriller' feel to your reads, you will probably enjoy it. Although this wasn't one of the best dystopian books that I've read, it was decent enough and I would like to see how the rest of the series pans out.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

9780141339573,"The first thing i noticed about this book is the cover. I love the cover sooo much! And since i'm in love with Legend, I thought that this one must be an excellent read. And it was. At first, it may seems boring and slow paced but then, its all there. The actions, the relationship between Day and June, the mystery of the Republic. Its all so captivating! I love Marie Lu's writing style. I love how her describe the characters. And finally, at the end of the book, it breaks m heart. To pieces. And i was moping around in my room 30 minutes after i finished that book. Good Job, Marie Lu. Good Job on breaking my heart.",Rizka Safira
9780141339573,"Favourite Quote: ""Love is illogical, love has consequences."" I loved Legend so much that I couldn't wait to read Prodigy, I had such high hopes! However I was let down, and I only give Prodigy 3/5 stars. The main problem I had with this book was the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of June in the first novel but she was okay, in this book she is just spoilt, stubborn, selfish, jealous and immature and has no idea what the hell she's doing, I really don't like her anymore. As for Day I loved him in the first book and I still did until halfway through Prodigy and then I only liked him, he become obsessessed with June and the whole insta-love thing is just so annoying, I feel like Day characters only revolves around June. As for romance between the pair, urgh I just hate it. HATE IT. The are just not right for each other in any way, I see no attraction or chemistry. There were times in this book were I thought Marie Lu was finally ending the pairing but no it's still going on. I still much prefer Day & Tess together!!!!! As for the plot, I found it quite boring until the last quarter, then it became interesting with a few twists and turns. The was definitely a cliff hanger involving Day's character but I feel like that will all be resolved in the final book. Overall Prodigy was disappointing but still a good read, and I will be continuing with the series.",brookexx
9780399256752,"Completely action packed Legend kept me turning page after page without a break. I can't believe I waited so much time to read it, seriously, this book has been in my TBR for more than 6 months and now that I finally picked it up I just want to kick myself for waiting so long! Marie Lu's writing style is unique, fresh, exhilarating and voracious. She always managed to kept my attention focused on the characters, their surroundigs and the action. Lots of action. But let me clarify this, when I say action I mean two types. First the type that has bombs, guns, fighting and a lot of running. And then the type that has a lot of things going on no-stop, you know? The kind that doesn't let you breath and you are every so often opening your mouth in a big O and muttering things like ""what?! how... when... what?!"" or my favorite ""*speachless* *gasp* *faning myself*"" while my sister asks ""What? What happened? You have to tell me!!!"" 'Cause, you know, we spent this weekend together and she doesn't like to read as much as I do so I have to tell her the whole book in parts. Let's just say she loved my short version as much as I loved the book, hahaha. I enjoyed to see the story from Day and June's POV; both of them gave depth to the plot in every page and their voices felt as real as life itself. In fact I would do anything to have the chance of reading Prodigy, the second book, right away. I want to know what happens next, I want to fight alongside them and help them unravel the truth. I desperately want to share more moments in their company and get to know them better. So yes, as you can tell I recommned this book a lot. Buy it, borrow it, don't know, I would say steal it but that would be bad so just ask your friends if they have it and I assure you that, after finishing it, you will buy your own copy and wait with me for book two :]",Alaiel Kreuz
9780399256752,"In the words of Barney Stinson, this book is LEGEN...wait for it...DARY - and it definitely does not disappoint if you have been anxiously salivating for LEGEND since Kristin Nelson first mentioned it early 2011. Each page will grip you by the shirt and pull you deeper into this strange America where everything seems to function on cleverly-disguised lies. Who to trust, who to believe, who to discard, who to protect, is there anyone who is genuine enough to do the right thing after learning the truth? THE GOOD BITS {Reminescent of Ender's Game and Divergent} There are good books, and there are GREAT books that leave you feeling exhilarated after reading them - and it is always thrilling to discover new books like LEGEND that fall ahead of the curve. ENDER'S GAME is one of my gold standards, and I am more than happily surprised to discover 2 books this year that come close to its greatness. There is something riveting about having child prodigies discover that their adult superiors may be manipulating them and enact in a fit of rebellion. {Day and June} I loved how well these two main characters played off each other. Although they came from different backgrounds, they both came to the chessboard with equal intelligence and resourcefulness. As much as I love Day, I will have to say that I favor June more. Most likely because she happens to be a girl who can kick butt both physically and mentally, but also because I think that LEGEND turned out to be more about June. Day may have greeted me at page 1 and had some problems of his own, but in my opinion, June did more of the dirty work of avenging her brother's death, going undercover to sniff out Day's whereabouts, learning the real truth about the Republic, and deciding whose side she wants to be on. THE BAD BITS {Not enough world-building} I had been hoping that LEGEND would go into how exactly North America split into two warring factions. While there is mention of the Republic and the Colonies, it does not come with a whole lot of details attached. LEGEND focuses more on the corruption within the Republic, and while that is all fascinating, how do the Colonies play into this? I am hoping the answers lie within the next book, especially considering Book 1 leaves Day and June on the very edge of new and even bigger chessboard. THE OVERALL LEGEND is well worth the wait - whether you read it now or wait until the rest of the series releases. Marie Lu has crafted a new world that stems from the familiar and branches into something wholly innovative. Smart, sensational, and oh-so-sicker-than-slick, LEGEND contains nothing but the best parts - and if a movie is in the making, all I have to say is: GAME ON!",theEPICrat
9780399256752,"In Legend, fifteen-year-old June is a highly intelligent member of the government. She has a great job and a very attentive brother. However, her life changes the day her brother dies. She's been told that he was a killed by Day. June decides to capture Day, who is basically uncapturable. However, things turn out different than what she expected when she finally finds him. Legend has everything that I love in a story. The plot is action-packed and filled with unexpected twists. I found myself surprised with some of the events that happened in the story. They were surprising and shocking. I'll admit that I was heartbroken by some if the things that happened to some characters. Legend had quite a gloomy atmosphere, but it went perfectly with what the dystopian genre is about. This was one of the best books in the genre I've read this year. The setting was exciting, as it is a controlled city like no other I've ever read about. Also, the pacing of the story was perfect. I found myself reading this book in no time, as I wanted to know what would happen next throughout the story. One of the aspects that I enjoyed the most about the story was the narration. I loved that Legend was told by both June and Day. It was great to get into the mind of both main characters. I loved getting to know each and what made them act the way they did. Day was such an awesome character. I loved him because he was a guy with a tortured past. He did the things he did to survive and help others, and I found it sweet. June was a great character. I enjoyed seeing her grow stronger through the book, even though she was kick-ass from the beginning. I liked seeing her change once she realized how bad things were. Even though she was strong from the start, June's change was noticeable through her actions and decisions. I loved each and every one of them. Overall, I enjoyed this book greatly. It's definitely one of the best in the dystopian genre. Legend is a thrilling ride from start to finish. This book is a must for dystopian fans. I loved it and can't wait for the second book!",Jennie - My Cute Bookshelf
9780399256752,"Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, the world of Legend is both oddly familiar and completely foreign. The United States no longer exists, and the western states have been enveloped into a new governmental entity known as the Republic - a militaristic state ruled by the ever-elected Elector Primo and Congress. Individual freedoms have been severely limited by the government and every citizen, at the age of 10, is required to take a trial or a test that will determine the course of one's life from that day forward. If a child scores high enough they will be granted a college education and a promising future with the Republic. If too low a score, the child will be sentenced to a life of dangerous menial labor, poverty and possibly infection by plague. Those who fail the test completely are sent to labor camps, all in service of the glorious Republic and Our Father, the Elector Primo. Day is a boy who failed the test, a boy who knows firsthand the truth about what happens to the children who don't pass the the Republic's trial. Having escaped his fate, he now creates as much trouble for the Republic as he can by destroying military property, stealing supplies, and hindering the war effort against the Colonies. He steals, bets, and scrounges to survive on the streets, constantly on the watch for Republic patrols who consider him enemy number one. Intelligent, intuitive, confident, and endearingly cocky, Day is a hero and a symbol of hope for the Republic's less fortunate. Day's primary concern though is caring for his family who, with the exception of his brother John, think him dead. He checks in on them from afar, provides for their needs when he is able and receives updates on their situation from John. When his family's front door is suddenly marked as infected by the plague patrols, Day is consumed by one goal only, an objective that will lead him down an irretraceable path. June, on the other hand, was born into a life of privilege. On her tenth birthday she aced the Republic's trial becoming the only child to ever receive a perfect score. Now, the Republic's golden girl, she is receiving the best education possible, being prepared for a much-anticipated military career in service to Elector and country. Incredibly bright and often bored with her studies, June is something of a troublemaker at her university, challenging herself to new heights of achievement with stunts that are frowned upon by school officials. However, once her brother is murdered, June is pulled out of training and put into the field. No one has been able to catch the elusive miscreant-turned-murderer known as Day, and if anyone has a chance of catching him June's superior officer is betting on the Republic's vengeance-seeking, star pupil. In addition to being extremely intelligent, June also displays a fierceness, a strategic mind, a sense of decency, and a hyper-intuitive eye. She is tough as nails, but she has a complete love for and an unshakable loyalty to her brother. Because of this vulnerability - this decision to love her family above the State - June becomes more likeable and more than just another mindless, propaganda-spouting drone. For readers who appreciate a strong, independent female lead, June is sure to please. One of the recurring themes that appear in dystopian novels seems to be that of the state vs. the individual. It's fascinating how a group of people, such as the Republic soldiers, can be indoctrinated to the point that their compassion for the individual is no longer a factor in their thought process - that a single human life or multiple lives can be stolen without a second thought, without any empathy at all. The Republic pawns have been robbed of their conscience, or perhaps they consciously choose to ignore that little nagging doubt, so that they may instead enjoy power, privilege and safety. It just never ceases to amaze how people can go along with such atrocities so blindly, and more horrifyingly perhaps, believing in the rightness of their actions. The overall blind devotion to the State, the unwillingness or inability for independent analytical thought, the substitution of the government modus operandi for one's personal/religious moral code is terrifying, and Lu communicates this very effectively. In addition to the wonderful characters and the interesting themes, the plot of this story is also very compelling. While not, perhaps the most complicated of mysteries when all is said and done, it's woven together well, and half the enjoyment of the mystery lies in the way that it's presented, is it not? It's well-paced, the danger is convincing and Lu is able to capture a real sense of gravity - a sense of helplessness and pain in the face of overwhelming odds - and it propels the reader through this story with the hope that June and Day will somehow be able to overcome the obstacles they face. Told in tandem by June and Day, Legend is yet another book that employs a shift in first-person narrator from chapter to chapter. And it is another book that uses the device quite well, as the reader is given a front row seat to June and Day's thoughts and motivations. Overall, Legend is dystopia well done. A fantastic debut that's bound for the keeper shelf.",Dani @ Refracted Light
9780399256752,"Legend by Marie Lu is AWESOME!! I really liked the flow that Marie Lu vividly illustrated through her well written story. I was surprised on how deeply engaged I was because I had my doubts with the simplicity of its cover, but within that cover there is nothing simple about it. Rich in action, intrigue, and suspense, a dystopian novel that will keep you awake through all hours of the night. Legend beckons you and I can't help but to ask for more! Daniel ""Day"" Altan Wing took his trials when he was only 10 years old. Every kid in the Republic takes their trials at 10. It decides whether they will be placed in the higher rankings of society or be one among the back breaking laborers living in the slums. And Day was among those who failed. With poor results he was taken into the labor camps along with the other children who didn't receive high scores. The twist is, there isn't such a thing as the labor camps. And all those who went, never came back or seen again. June is the prodigy of the Republic. She is the only one who scored a perfect 1500 on her trials. A bright future is ahead for her; and at such a young age (15 years) she's already a well decorated officer. Everything runs smoothly for June until Day comes along and kills her older brother, Metias. Left with no parents and now her brother, she begins her agenda of bringing down the Republic's elusive criminal, Day, and she's going to make sure he's going to get what he deserves. Legend by Marie Lu alternates from Day's voice to June's, but you will never mistake who your reading. Along with each character having their own designated color text, Day's being gold text and June's being black, each of the two is a distinct character with two complete different voices. I am amazed on how fluid I read Legend. It doesn't skip a beat; when June stops her tale Day picks it right back up where she left off. Another favorite I will add to my collection. I am on the edge of my seat eager for Legend's sequel!! I RECOMMEND!!",SpadesHigh
9780399256769,"Legend captured my attention with its action-oriented story line, and likable characters that I couldn't get of; Prodigy delivered all of that and more in this exceptional sequel. Reasons to Read: 1. Flawless plot continuity: Prodigy perfectly builds on the story first introduced in Legend; there's no lull, and importantly Marie really expands on the plot lines and twists revealed in the first book of the series. 2. Strong world-building: Legend stands out among other futuristic YA books for its impeccable world-building, and this only improves in Legend. We get to see a bit more of the world that June and Day live in, and experience new places at the same time as the characters do. 3. An action-oriented book: I love books that are bursting with action and thrills, and Prodigy is exactly that. June and Day are both tough characters, in their own way, but their courage puts them in trying situations (which means that the reader gets plenty of excitement and action)! 4. A romance you can root for: One of my favourite things about June and Day's relationship is that they're working for it. This rarely comes up in YA books, and I'm so pleased to see characters that try to communicate with one another, and while they aren't perfect you can easily see that their relationship doesn't just magically work out. It's a refreshing take on a love story, and one that is realistic too. I also love all the details and attention Marie pays to the secondary characters and their stories, and it comes across so well in Prodigy (Metias will forever and ever be my favourite). That being said, at times it almost feels like there's a little too much going on for me to really understand and appreciate all the side stories that are happening. It can take away from the overall story, although I understand that this is hard when you have such a large fictional world and only three books. You just can't fit everything in.

Chronicling the adventures of young Sophie Foster, whose world is turned upside-down in the Natural History museum, the book is a magical romp through a world of Ms. Messenger's imagination. No, no spoilers here - that's not fair. But I will say a few things. First, though this is aimed squarely at the YA market, I had NO issues with the writing style at all. It is, simply, well-written. It romps, it rolls, and it pulls you in in about three pages. Look, I'm a quick reader, but I finished this nearly-500 page book in less than two days (during which time I also did.. well, lots of other stuff). Second, the characters feel real. They are unique voices, consistent, and well-defined. And they don't read as 'stock' characters - although Elwin does remind me quite a bit of McCoy (though that could be my background bleeding through). Finally, and this is the big one for me - the dialogue WORKS. You have read my stuff - I do dialogue instead of narrative. It's how I write. And it's what I like to read. Well, I LOVE what Shannon did with her dialogue. It isn't forced, it isn't stilted - it flows and moves as real speech should and does. My ONLY quibble with the book is the setting of the academy for the world's kids. It feels too much like Hogwarts. Now, that isn't a terrible thing, and, given the heroine is a 13-year-old girl, I'm not sure HOW you could do a book without incorporating SOME kind of school, but it's the one bit that required a little extra 'suspension of disbelief.' That being said... Go get this book. And hope that she decides to write another (and another, and another...).",TheAdamG
9781907992391,"The Tour of Duty collections completely re-ignited my love for Dredd. Well written, amazing range of artwork and a lot of loose ends tied up from Dredd's past. I'm terrible at writing reviews but I would recommend this collection to any Dredd fan. Buy the first part before this though otherwise you may be a little lost!",Craig Burdis
9781907992674,"At the time of writing, Mark Millar and Grant Morrison are fairly notable names in the world of comicdom. Grant Morrison is a genuine talent, and Mark Millar is seen as being an important media figure with movies such as 'Wanted' and 'Kick-Ass' bearing his name. Cashing in on this is Rebellion (the publisher), building some momentum and attention to the upcoming Dredd movie. The graphic novel compiles two Judge Dredd stories from the parent title, the galaxy's greatest comic, 2000 AD. The main author of Judge Dredd, John Wagner, takes a backseat to allow Morrison and Millar to scribe these tales, back in the early 1990's; with Austin and Ezquerra on respective art duties. Crusade plays with the idea of Judges from judicial systems from around the world converging on the Ultima Thule complex in the Antarctic on the hunt for a crash-landed astronaut who has returned with a message from god. Politics, gunfire, religious pontificating, and mine-rides in talking mine-carts ensue. The pace is lightning fast, the characters highly disposable, and the tone is satirical. Frankenstein Division by Mark Millar alone is fast and furious mayhem, beautifully depicted by Carlos Ezquerra, on a one-beat premise about a killing machine constructed from dead soldiers out for revenge against Dredd, hardwired into its DNA. So is it worth it? Judge Dredd is a powerful central character and has been a tour de force in the underground that is non-American, non-Superhero comics for over 35 years now. These two tales are amongst the more mediocre offerings, and for Judge Dredd purists the only reasons for including this volume in your collection is for either nostaligia, or completing your collection. Like me. If you have bought this volume because you like the works of Morrison or Millar, then fantastic, welcome to Judge Dredd. Now go and read some good stuff. Judge Dredd stories like America, Mandroid, Total War, The Apocalypse War, The Pit, Tour of Duty, and so very much more. John Wagner is an incredible writer who has developed his vision for four decades now. So for those of you lucky enough to be discovering Judge Dredd and the future-shocked worlds of 2000 AD for the first time: then welcome to the crusade!",Paul Stewart
9781907992674,"Reason for Reading: I'm falling in love with Judge Dredd and his whole post-apocalyptic world. I gave this book 5 stars but I'll let you know right away it certainly wasn't for its literary merit. There was a lot of cheesy dialogue and readers of modern comics may not be able to get past that. But I have to say I love to laugh at the cheese in my comics when it comes to superheroes and villains. The Judges, including Dredd, are the heroes of these books but one doesn't necessarily side with them or like them. They are ""better"" than the villains but then these judges are police, judge and jury rolled up into one person who makes a judgement call in matters of seconds with each case they take on. This book is divided into 2 separate stories taken from the pages of ""2000AD"". They are random stories both written by Morrison & Millar with a very weak connecting theme that they are both set in an Arctic cold location. The first story in the book is ""Crusade"" first published in 1994 is set in the South Pole and has an ""Alien"" vibe to it as they know a monster is hidden in the secret lab where representative Judges (the best of the best) have been sent to get this former man back to their official respective Cities and learn his truth. I really enjoyed this story. It was much longer than the second one and covered 10 issues. The plot built up rather speedily. Though it did lag a bit in the middle, The authors did manage to quickly pull it back up and gave us an action packed story. I was a little irked that the bad guy had to be the Vatican City, complete with his ""Inquisitor Judge"", but what can you expect from anti-papist Brits anyway (I'm British so I'm allowed to say this kind of stuff :-) The second story ""Frankenstein Division"" is much shorter and comes from 1995. This one has the Soviets as bad guys in the sense that one of their inventions, a super judge made from remnants of judges that had been killed by Dredd during the Apocalyptic Wars, has escaped from Siberia with one thought on its mind: find and destroy Judge Dredd. A great bit of battle action and behind the scenes dirty politics as we see how ""justice"" is handed out to those who let the super judge escape in the first place. I'm loving these books and glimpses into the Judge Dredd universe where Judges are police, judge, jury and sentencer (though mostly executioner) all in one person!",Nicola Mansfield
9781781080320,"Reason for Reading: I love the Judge Dredd universe! While the title may have you thinking differently, this book has no paranormal activity until the very last one-off story. The book begins with the titular story from the '80s which is 7 parts long and almost half the book in length. ""Werewolves"" have found their way into Mega-City from the Undercity, their existence is based upon science, chemicals to be exact. I loved this story, very well done and written by Wagner & Grant. The book is published in b/w up to this point. Then we jump ahead to the 2000s for a direct sequel to this story. From here the art in the book is full colour. I also loved this sequel written by Wagner but I found the art very strange. Even though the publisher's summary tells us 3 other werewolf stories are included, these two which make up half the book are the only true ""werewolf"" stories. The rest of the book contains two somewhat thematically related one-offs. First is a story set in the Cursed Earth which features bounty hunters who are mutants descended from Navajo spiritwalkers and are permanently in humanoid dog form. This introduces (to me) a great female character named Quadrille, I hope she shows up again. Finally, is ""Asylum"" which involves the Psi-Division and a paranormal creature, a vampire. This is the first time I've met up with Psi Judge Karyn but I liked her and I found the story creepy but unexpected when the theme is supposed to be werewolves. A good collection of some of the stranger tales one can find within the Dredd universe. I prefer the proper crime stuff myself but am not against the weirder storylines at all. Good book for the Halloween season.",Nicola Mansfield
9781781080719,"Reason for Reading: I love the Judge Dredd universe and I've heard of Titan mentioned in previous stories so this was fairly exciting to take a look at a story set on the planetary penal colony for criminal judges. The book consists in total of four stories. First of all come two back to back sequential stories which take up 90% of the book. ""Purgatory"" shows us life on Titan for all those there, both the convicts and the guards, under the sadistic rule of Governor Khurtz. Judge Grice and his followers have just recently been sent to the colony for trying to kill Judge Dredd and it would seem that is a common crime amongst the inmates. We learn that not only are the prisoners abused and maltreated but are also being experimented on for scientific experiments and Khurtz's personal enjoyment. Titan is in possession of two mighty weapons that could wipe out the population of earth and this causes a riot between the inmates and the guards which leads us to the titular story ""Inferno"". Here the prisoners have taken over the asylum with Grice as their leader. They take the weapon and head straight to Mega-City One to take it out and take over what will be left of it. This storyline ends up nicely, though brutal. The Dredd that we experience hear is one of no regrets, one out to get the bad guy no matter what, all means will justify the end. Almost every page of this story is brutal violence as we see mankind at his most base sinful nature. A gripping story with some mentions of past events that are intriguing and make me want to catch up on all the storylines in between I've missed out on. The last two stories are very short, one-off episodes. I've already read a Judge Dredd Christmas story and this book includes another called ""I Hate Christmas"". A few pages of Dredd working on Christmas eve showing exactly why Dredd has every reason to hate the season. Finally ""Top Gun"" is presented as a one-off where Dredd meets one of the tech guys who suits him up with some new gear, a new gun and bike supposedly with the latest, greatest upgrades. Off to settle down a cube breakout, Dredd's new gear malfunctions and in the end he dispatches ""Joe Dredd justice"" to all those who deserve it. Again these stories are violent and brutal but these two have some dry humour to lighten things. Great volume!",Nicola Mansfield
9781781080290,"Reason for Reading: Latest Judge Dredd release. These collections of Judge Dredd graphic novels usual revolve around a writer, but this time the stories all share a common theme, Judges who have crossed over to the other side of the law. This collection contains quite a number of short stories and a couple of longer series that went on for several issues. I actually enjoyed all of them, though a couple were a bit cheesy, and only one I didn't enjoy and that was because of the very strange art style. The book also contains stories from the '80s up to today, presenting an interesting look at the history of the comic itself. The classic '80s style art is my favourite and the stories are certainly more aimed at juveniles, though they are rather violent. As we move into the '90s the art becomes smoother, cartoonier, more obviously computer aided and the blood flows very freely. The 2000s bring dark, adult stories with semi nudity and much violence and an accompanying dark, atmospheric art style. Judge Dredd also gets a personality in the newer stories, we find out his first name and his character is explored. An all around great collection that would make a good introduction to the Dredd character. I enjoyed all the stories, some more than others but my favourite were two that featured Judge Manners, a rogue Judge who was one nasty piece of work!",Nicola Mansfield
9781781080672,"Reason for Reading: I'm a huge Judge Dredd fan and this is the latest North American publication. At this point I recognise the names of the popular Dredd writers but I can't say I have any particular favourites except for Wagner, of course. This is actually my first time to come across Ennis in my rediscovery of Dredd this past year or so; so my attraction here was not to the author in particular but just to more Dredd stories. This book contains quite a nice selection of stories with several longer multi-issue stories interspersed with short one-issue ones. The entire book is in colour except for the last story which comes to us from the 1993 Judge Dredd Yearbook. All the stories are from the '90s which brings a nice consistency to the collection. The book begins with ""Emerald Isle"", a multi-part story which takes Dredd to Ireland and a violent tale of terrorists. Here we meet Judge Joyce who will return again in this collection. I only had two problems with this book and one was the ""cheese"" in this story. Now I like the cheesiness of early Judge Dredd as much as the next fellow but a gun invented to shoot potatoes instead of bullets was a bit beyond it; death by potato lodged in forehead, uh-huh. Otherwise a great story. Next is a short story where Dredd meets the very first guy he ever arrested. ""Almighty Dredd"" then brings a multi-parter where a bunch of kooks have created a religion around Dredd himself. Let's just say they do get to meet their maker! This is where I had my second problem. Artist Ian Gibson drew this one and used a very cartoony style which I did not appreciate at all. His work is in a lot of my books and I haven't had this problem with it before but the style just didn't work for me here. I love the '90s Dredd! His typical attitude is ""Give yourself up to the laaaaaw!"" Criminal ""Never!"" Dredd ""Brakka! Brakka! Blamm!"" ""Call in the meat."" Anyway, next up is a story with probably the most violent villain I've come across in the Dredd Universe so far, Blender McCoy. This multi-parter is violent but also a love story. A very good one. Then another multi-parter as Judge Joyce comes to Mega-City One following a couple of bad guys on the run from Emerald Isle. By the time he's finished he's more than glad to go back home. I rather like Judge Joyce. Another multi-parter of a vigilante ex-Judge called ""Raider"". Here I actually sympathized with him rather than Dredd. I love Dredd, but he can be a high and mighty jerk. LOL. This story also introduced me to my first ""Wally Squad"" (I'll be reading Low Life soon) member Judge Lola Palmtree. I liked her and hope she comes back again. Then the book ends with two one issue stories a mediocre story of the illegal drug snow, aka sugar and finally the only b/w in this book, a return to Emerald Isle with a funny but very gruesome story of a case for Judge Joyce. A great collection of '90s Judge Dredd stories!",Nicola Mansfield
9781905437436,"This collection contains eight stories but only four of them star Judge Dredd. Five of them feature a Cursed Earth Judge named Koburn. These stories hang together very well and you develop a liking for the maverick lawman and his practical brand of justice. The Dredd stories are good with Garth Ennis writing a couple of great works. If you are a new reader or have been absent for a while you don't really get the full appreciation, particularly when classic villains from the past appear. Some stories shine brighter than others but there are no clangers. It seems an odd proposition to collate stories by artist but as Ezquerra was one of Dredd's creators this isn't so bizarre. All the stories are modern and there are no definitive Dredd or Mega-city moments. They are all dialogue heavy too so they clearly weren't chosen for their artistic value. This does seem to be new money for old rope. All the stories are in colour and you do get to see Ezquerra on fine form depicting both the clean lines of the megacity and the grunge of the Cursed Earth. This is where Ezquerra truly excels. His feathery, worn style is absolutely perfect for the rad-wastes and their collection of bizarre muties. This is a nice long read with many chuckles and great plots even if the title is misleading. Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels
9780141350868,"This is the first title bought and read on my first Kindle and what a book to start with. I had my eye on this title for such a long while leading to it's release but my pleas to review it for the publisher sadly led no-where.Along came my Kindle and I bought this book for it straight away with the price for the Kindle version being half that of the paperback and I'm so very glad that I did as for a debut novel by a new author it's a fantastic beginning to a brand new trilogy, The Half Life Trilogy. The book revolves around Nathan who's a 'Half Code', his father is a Black Witch and his mother was a Witch Witch. Basically it's the story of what kind of witch will Nathan become, will he be Black like his serial killer father Marcus or White like his dead mother and his, very much alive, half siblings. To say too much more than that would ruin the book for those who haven't read it yet. I have read lots of books with witches in before but this one is unique in the fact that none of the other books have treated the subject of the half 'breed' in this kind of way. Nathan is constantly treated with disdain over something he has absolutely no control over and that is his parentage, his heritage. As his father is the most evil Black witch ever known, Nathan is continuously presumed to follow in his footsteps regardless of anything he may do to the contrary and it's basically torturous for him to suffer through. You find your heart breaking for him over and over as you watch him being slowly pushed further and further away from his family, who he loves very much. The treatment he suffers is truly awful and not a pleasant subject to read about but it's a necessary part of the story. The book takes you through a whirlwind of emotions, from sadness to pity, from anger through to gladness which is a great achievement for a debut novel and author. I was a little worried about the writing style in the first chapter as it seemed like an odd way to write but thankfully it only lasted that first chapter and then the proper style took over. The story itself isn't shy in portraying the harder aspects of the tale and that is something I'm thankful for as it could have so easily been shined over if you know what I mean, the book needed a certain about of grittiness to it as Nathan's story is far from a happy one, at least to start with and by the end you have to wonder what on earth he's going to do with himself. Nathan is a wonderful character, hard as nails and a total fighter through and through but with such a soft centre, he cares for his family,the few friends he has and even the father he doesn't even know. He has a huge sense of self preservation which he needs to get him through each and every day but he also is incredibly curious about things he doesn't know, in particular when it comes to his mysterious father, who he has never met. It's a curiosity that is fully understandable as he feel he can't really understand himself and his Black heritage as he nothing to base it on especially as the rest of his family are all as White as they come. Sally Green has a lovely touch and an imagination that shines through on the page. Her writing style flows easily and she uses the sort of language typical to YA novels, I think I only had to look up words twice and that was simply as they weren't words I'd heard of before. Talking of words I was a but surprised by one characters use of her word to describe White witches that is a vulgar slang term we Brits use quite a lot, you all know what word I mean...... Shite! I was surprised by it's use especially as the author is British herself and must know of it's other use. End of the day it is a minor niggle and doesn't effect the book in any way. How I'm supposed to wait until next year for Half Wild I really don't know, I want to read it RIGHT NOW! No fair......... Unsure if it's a book for you then I would say in my opinion it would be a shame to miss out as it really is a fantastic read!",Thea Wilson
9781939683731,"Awesome! This is a major volume in the Grimm Universe with all the realms coming together for an epic battle with the Dark Queen and her Dark Horde. A lot of major characters are in this one with some new ones being introduced as well. Things are getting pretty hairy for Grimm readers, especially like me who can't seem to get a grip on what order everything should be read. But this is definately a set up volume and even though it jumps all over the place it also puts into perspective what is going on with everyone. This volume itself mentions Myst, Wonderland, the New Gods and the Realm Knights. Lots of action and violence as usual but surprisingly tamer than the norm on sex and titillating images. The last issue, written by Pat Shand, one of Zenescope's regulars and a favourite of mine, was very poignant and has a particularly excellent ending. I also think if you've been a dipper into the Grimm Universe so far I think this series is a good place to get reintroduced to the action.",Nicola Mansfield
9781939683588,"Excellent! I thoroughly enjoyed this title. I have difficulty in placing these trades in exact chronological order but as far as I can tell this is a direct sequel to ""Realm Knights"" and though this story is not dependant on that one; it would probably enhance enjoyment to start there. This time only Agent Red Hood and Agent Robyn Hood are called to duty. Brief mention is made of some events from Realm Knights but only one time is it worth Zenescope's infamous use of the asterix reference to the previous volume. LOL. Pat Shand is becoming one of my favourite author from this publisher and knows how to tell a good story and keep the very complicated world-building and crossover characters in line, giving the reader brief hints to remember who is who and what is what. This story was highly entertaining, and while sexy and violent, was a little tamer than usual. The art was gorgeous, as it almost always is. This story really gets us into the beginnings of the plan of the Dark Horde's takeover and show their massive armies of orcs and ogres, all hinting at a little Lord of the Rings-ish feel to it. The book also ends with a sneak peak preview of the Robyn Hood one-shot comic which is a mission she is sent on within the pages of this volume.

9780552561730,"Who doesn't love to read a story about boy and girl, love and hate, angel versus demon? If this sounds like the sort of book you'd like to curl up with on a couch, then Fallen, the first book of the series with the same name, is the book for you. Raised in Dallas and schooled in Atlanta, author Lauren Kate finished her M.A. in Creative Writing at UC Davis, where she also teaches. Her books have been translated into over thirty languages. She lives with her husband and currently works on the final book in the Fallen series, Rapture. Fallen is a story of seventeen years old Lucy, whose boyfriend died in unknown circumstances. As a result of this accident she must go to a juvenile detention educational facility - Sword & Cross School. When she enters the institute, she realized how much her life will change. Cameras watch her every move and discipline is strict. Just like her, it seems that other students have also their terrible secrets. On the first day she meets Arriane Alter, and both girls stick together and become good friends. When she meets Daniel, a brilliant student, her new life seems to get easier. She falls in love with him. This is where things get strange. Daniel is a fallen angel, he is in love with Lucy and every seventeen years he must re-suffer her death. Lucy seems to be immortal; she dies every time they meet, and is then reborn as a normal girl. However she doesn't remember her previous lives. Daniel is not the only fallen angel in the school. On her first day she met Cam, a handsome young man. Cam, like Daniel, is a fallen angel, however she does not know that both of them are the standards on the opposite sides of the ancient war of good versus evil. During her short time at Sword & Cross, Lucy must choose between finding out the truth that Daniel, Cam, Arriane and a whole bunch of others are hiding, or fighting for the love that she has felt ever since she saw Daniel. Fallen is a romantic and fantasy novel with elements of horror. From the beginning to the end the story is captivating and exciting. The main protagonists of the book are two teenagers. Fallen is mainly book for teenagers, but also more mature readers will find in it something for themselves. The setting of the old cemetery and the historic buildings of the school give an air of mystery to the whole story. The heroes in this novel are outcasts of society. Fallen angels, guardians of the innocent on the one hand, and dangerous warriors on the other. In these days, when the theme of vampires is almost worshipped, the idea of portraying fallen angels is a guarantee of success. I can strongly recommend this book to a fans of fantasy stories, such as, The Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer or The Mortal Instruments Saga by Cassandra Clare. After reading Fallen, there still is a certain hunger in us, questions haven't been answered, mysteries still abound. We are inexorably drawn to read the next book in the series - Torment. Find yourself a copy of this book and a comfortable sofa, and clear your weekend schedule.",Dr.Oasis
9780552561730,"My review: Since the fourth and last book in the Fallen series is about to be published in June 2012, I thought that I would start with the series! Since this book has been on my TBR list for a while, this review will also be part of TBR Pile 2012 Challenge. I have admired the covers of Laren Kate's books! The cover of Fallen was also something that caught my eye first, long before I purchased the book. I have followed the reviews of the three books which are out already and I am happy that I finally read Fallen. It is the first book of Lauren Kate's book which I have read and I enjoyed it. The book is written with a nice pace, the story rolls out intriguingly while reading and the characters are captivating. When you add surprises in the plot and a twisted romance story, then you'd get Fallen - amazing book. It was fun and easy to read and I read it in one sitting. Regarding the plot: The story starts out with the scene from 1854 and that immediately caught my attention. Right after that the reader was brought to the present, to year 2099, to a closed school named Sword & Cross School. The main character Luce is sent to Sword & Cross due to her different behavior in her childhood and the suspicion of her involvement in a murder of her friend Trevor. Everything is different in Sword & Cross, especially the students - they all have some criminal or mysterious backgrounds. During the first day in the new school Luce sees a boy who seems so familiar, but she cannot place him. Daniel, who is good looking, has beautiful eyes and is attracting Luce towards him, turns her down. It seems that he has no interest in Luce. Luce quickly find her some new friends who are very different from her friends back at home, but nevertheless, she creates friendships with Penn, Arriane, Cam and others in the school. Still, she is intrigued by Daniel and cannot understand why he is friendly in one minute and then minute late can be cold as ice towards her. Step by step Luce and Daniel are coming closer to each other. Luce starts finding clues about who Daniel is thanks to Penn and she finds surprisingly also a lot about her own past. I really loved the story: it surprised me several times with its twists and turns, the characters were very enjoyable and very fresh perspective to angels, especially fallen angels. I also enjoyed the surroundings of Sword & Cross School! Regarding the characters: Besides the captivating narrative, the characters were really well-written and intriguing in Fallen. Both main characters and many supportive characters had spark, boldness and they all had their stories to tell. Luce is a beautiful and smart girl who just has some abilities that causes her trouble. She sees shadows and other things which other people cannot and that makes her life complicated. She is persistent and wants to know who Daniel is. Daniel is one of my favorite male protagonists of the YA books I have read in 2012! Daniel is good looking, smart, independent and different from others. He seems to have this bad-guy attitude around him, but he is always there when Luce needs him. I absolutely adored two supportive characters in Fallen: Arriane and Penn. These two girls where so different, yet I really enjoyed their characters. Both of the characters had a big role to play in Fallen and their stories took an interesting and unexpected turn to me. When reading Fallen, you cannot be untouched by Cam. Cam takes a big interest in Luce and Luce does feel attracted to Cam. Cam was a complex character who had both good and bad sides and that was enjoyable! I liked that the author made him little naughty, little good - not entirely bad. Generally: Fallen was fascinating, scary, fresh YA book with a wonderful story to tell and captivating characters! I am really glad that I picked the book up for reading and I cannot wait reading the next books in the series! Absolutely loved it!",Inga Kupp-Silberg
9780552561730,"SPOILERS ALERT! 3.5 Stars Luce ends up in Swords & Cross boarding school after an arson incident involving her boyfriend at her old school; one which was caused by the shadowy figures that keep following her. On her first day, she meets Arriane, finds herself inexplicable drawn to a guy, Daniel who for some reason hates her, manages to get humiliated in front of the entire school and hopefully finds a trusted friend in Penn. As the days pass by, a boy, Cam seems to make her feel most comfortable at this place and another, Daniel continues to shun her with occasional tenderness and she can't drop feeling a certain connection to him. Luce begins to somewhat fight back the shadows and makes it her mission to find information about Daniel with the help of Penn. She and Todd a fellow student are saved from a fire by some invisible force but Todd is killed by the shadows. In one of those rare moments with Daniel, Luce is compelled to tell him about the shadows she sees and gets an unexpected reaction from him; he seemed in despair. Cam cozying up with Luce ticks Daniel, leading to a fight; over her. That scene makes Luce realize that that she has to get things straight out with Cam as it is Daniel she feels for. Both of them finally give in to their building emotions in an intense kiss leaving Daniel baffled later that Luce survived. Daniel is forced to tell Luce the truth that leaves her shaken to the core; everything he said seemed as much familiar as it sounded crazy. All turns chaotic just as Luce begins to grasp what Daniel truly was and the depth of their relationship. With the end of an eventful night, Luce is forced to hide away, the fact still remains that she still knows little of the world she has been trust into. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Alright, I'm having a sort of love/hate relationship with this book. The good news is that I love it more. First off, the first chapter about the past was a bad idea; it revealed much of the focal point of this book. I felt that the readers should have been kept guessing, trying to figure out the reason to Daniels behavior and their secret past. The writer lost the suspense element there. Apart from that, the first half of the book was quite dragging with little progress and it lacked world building and relationship building; I would have loved to see more tension and love building between Daniel and Luce instead of just recognition and the repetition of it. Another down point is that there was little character development on Daniel and Cam came out a more interesting and compelling character that it felt like a love triangle with Cam having the advantage. In the second half, the story started to really progress and got interesting. The bright side of it is Ms. Kate's solid writing with the right amount of showing with less explaining which am sure would have frustrated some but I love the mystery and the author must have done that to fruit later installments. Moreover, Luce's character was realistic and believable and the secondary characters were carefully penned and were fun and interesting especially Cam who was the most fascinating character so far. Lastly, I liked the cliff hanger sort of climax leaving more mystery to be uncovered.",Shayla

9780552561792,"I really didn't like this book, I was reading it because I started with the first one and don't like not finishing a series but now I finally did it, it's always the same over and over again. I don't like that the book is in third person, that made me unable to live in the personage' character. I really want her to be with Cam but we all know that's not going to happen, I don't like writing bad reviews but I'm so disappointed, when I first started reading the books I was so excited but it was a big let down. I don't recommend this book.",Roxanne Foster
9780385739139,"At the very start of the story we get a peek of a couple, where one is trying to stay away from the other and the other is trying just as hard to be with that one... but I'll come back to the first chapter in a bit. Luce Price has arrives at Sword & Cross, a reform school for troublesome teens, and instantly knows that this school isn't like any other school, reform or not, this is a school that she could never have imagined existing. Such a dark, unwelcoming and prison-like place, where contact with the outside world is only allowed in 5 minute weekly phone calls, their uniform is to wear all black and there are security cameras everywhere to monitor your every move. Everything seems hopeless and depressing to Luce until she sees Daniel. The moment her eyes land on Daniel, she is instantly drawn to him and wants to run to him, but why the instant connection? Why does Daniel seem so familiar and comforting to her... and when Daniel wants nothing to do with her and goes out of his way to make sure that she knows he has no interest it only increases Luce's curiosity to find out why he pushes her away and what secrets Daniel may be hiding. The mystery surrounding Luce and Daniel's pasts is consuming. A page-turner right from the start. We meet other students, Luce's new friends, Daniel's old friends, and at first I just wanted to dismiss them and wished that the story would just concentrate on their relationship. But as time goes on, these other characters play major roles in both of their lives. Not one person can be dismissed nor forgotten. Little by little, we find out why Luce was sent to Sword & Cross, what she can see, what her story is. We also find out why Daniel is so desperate to stay away from Luce. Daniel's story is heart breaking and you cannot help fall for for Daniel and want to hug him too. In the end, we finally hear the whole story that connects Daniel and Luce together... forever! because true love cannot be denied! I did find that the book was a bit choppy at times because it doesn't go into great details that I would have liked to have seen. But it doesn't keep the story from flowing. We are learning and experiencing everything as Luce is and I really liked that the author followed through with that. Now, let's get back to that first chapter! It's titled, In The Beginning and takes place in England, 1854. There are no names, the characters are referred to as ""He"" and ""She"". She is drawn to him everyday. He tries to stay away, but has a hard time doing so. He comforts himself by drawing pictures of her, it's obvious that he cares for her deeply. She doesn't know how or why, but she knows that she loves him and wants to be with him and makes it impossible for him to not cave in to her. And then he doesn't... They have their moment and we are left with a huge, oh my god! What just happened?! and of course, you need to know why. I really loved how the first chapter just draws you in by giving us a sort of tease... I have a huge soft spot for forbidden love.",Margarita Cortina
9780385739139,"Who doesn't love to read a story about boy and girl, love and hate, angel versus demon? If this sounds like the sort of book you'd like to curl up with on a couch, then Fallen, the first book of the series with the same name, is the book for you. Raised in Dallas and schooled in Atlanta, author Lauren Kate finished her M.A. in Creative Writing at UC Davis, where she also teaches. Her books have been translated into over thirty languages. She lives with her husband and currently works on the final book in the Fallen series, Rapture. Fallen is a story of seventeen years old Lucy, whose boyfriend died in unknown circumstances. As a result of this accident she must go to a juvenile detention educational facility - Sword & Cross School. When she enters the institute, she realized how much her life will change. Cameras watch her every move and discipline is strict. Just like her, it seems that other students have also their terrible secrets. On the first day she meets Arriane Alter, and both girls stick together and become good friends. When she meets Daniel, a brilliant student, her new life seems to get easier. She falls in love with him. This is where things get strange. Daniel is a fallen angel, he is in love with Lucy and every seventeen years he must re-suffer her death. Lucy seems to be immortal; she dies every time they meet, and is then reborn as a normal girl. However she doesn't remember her previous lives. Daniel is not the only fallen angel in the school. On her first day she met Cam, a handsome young man. Cam, like Daniel, is a fallen angel, however she does not know that both of them are the standards on the opposite sides of the ancient war of good versus evil. During her short time at Sword & Cross, Lucy must choose between finding out the truth that Daniel, Cam, Arriane and a whole bunch of others are hiding, or fighting for the love that she has felt ever since she saw Daniel. Fallen is a romantic and fantasy novel with elements of horror. From the beginning to the end the story is captivating and exciting. The main protagonists of the book are two teenagers. Fallen is mainly book for teenagers, but also more mature readers will find in it something for themselves. The setting of the old cemetery and the historic buildings of the school give an air of mystery to the whole story. The heroes in this novel are outcasts of society. Fallen angels, guardians of the innocent on the one hand, and dangerous warriors on the other. In these days, when the theme of vampires is almost worshipped, the idea of portraying fallen angels is a guarantee of success. I can strongly recommend this book to a fans of fantasy stories, such as, The Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer or The Mortal Instruments Saga by Cassandra Clare. After reading Fallen, there still is a certain hunger in us, questions haven't been answered, mysteries still abound. We are inexorably drawn to read the next book in the series - Torment. Find yourself a copy of this book and a comfortable sofa, and clear your weekend schedule.",Dr.Oasis
9780385739139,"It all starts with the prologue set in 1854, in which we learn something about the story's heart without being given any details. The embodiment of a teasing prologue! Then story sets back into present time where we attend Sword & Cross school together with Luce, from whose POV Fallen is narrated. Although she is just one of many troubled teenagers at Sword & Cross who have committed crimes, identifying with her felt very easy to me. The more she puts the blame for a murder on her, the more I want to prove her innocence. Luce is a protagonist, whose whole identity hasn't been revealed yet, which makes her interesting and mysterious. Beside this haunting murder mystery, Luce has to experience immediate rejection by Daniel, one of the dark Sword & Cross students, she feels exceptionally attracted to. The more Daniel pushes Luce away, the more Cam, a fellow new student, uses the chance to lull Luce into his irresistible charm. I considered Daniel and Cam as interesting counterparts, Cam the charming, active and almost angelic and Daniel the passive, cold and dark fighter. Both hold high tension potential, that not only Luce gets mesmerized by. I am not only eager to learn more about the future of each character and the mysteries that accompany them, but about Luce' and Daniel's past and the dark secret that lingers around their fate. My favourite symbolism lies in the application of shadows as enemies and the growing power of an ancient evil. Although the final enemy hasn't appeared yet, the threatening shadows produce an ever present awareness of the danger awaiting our favourite protagonists. I like Lauren Kate's pleasant writing style and the way she develops the story around Luce and Daniel, never giving away too much to hold the overall tension. She created a world in which every character seems to have an even darker secret than the other, you have to expect the unexpected every new page and in which you feel like a small feather in the infinite currents of heaven and the dark fires of hell. THE VERDICT It looks like Fallen is just the rising in a suspense curve about the quartet around Luce and Daniel. Go and get Torment, because you won't be able to stand the tormenting wait for the story to continue for long!",MissPageTurner
9780385739139,"Honestly I was a little hesitant to pick this book up, I had heard really good things about it but also really bad things. But in the end I decided to pick it up the other day to take it with me to the beach. I for one really liked this book I think it's original sure it has somethings in common with other books, but really someone show me a book that has absolutely nothing to do with another one. Luce is a pretty seventeen year old who is sent to Sword and Cross, a school for problematic children. She's not especially happy at giving away her mobile or the fact that ""the reds are watching her"" but she lives with it in a very mature way (me? I would be kicking and screaming and trying to hide things to keep^^) There she meets Cam a good looking boy who catches her attention by being nice to her, until Daniel Grigori appears, he seems like the perfect boy, until he flips her of and Luce has a feeling they've met before. I enjoyed the different characters and Arriane is the best!!! I also felt incredibly sorry for Penn (no spoilers)",Nathiel Gold

9780385739139,"honeslty. im not a picky reader, but this i did not enjoy one bit. when you look at the cover fallen it looks like an amzing book, also when you read the short description its sounds amazing..well its far from that. first complaint is its written in third person (which I am VERY picky about) a book that is 3rd person has to be really well written to get and keep my attention (such as City of bones(:) and Fallen completly failed at keeping it. I normally don't write bad reviews, and i hate writing them, but this book has an exception. I was SO excited to read Fallen, I knew when going into this book that the reviews were on either one side of the fence or the other..meaning either the person loved it or hated it. Fallen had a lot of potential to be amazing, but while reading the book all i could think of is ..wow there is way to many description on the scenry its giving me a headache . This book was not HORRIABLE, I have read worst (much worst) but i can say I still didnt like it and will not be reading Torment, or Passion. Please no one be upset over my review, I understand that there are thousands of people out there that LOVE the Fallen series, I for one am not one of them though. (I was hoping to be...) Random Note: I am getting so sick of all these Angel books (the ones that fail at least)",haley
9780385739146,"Don't get me wrong I do like this series, but this book felt like a filler to me, we don't find out anything new and Luce is starting to really annoy me, I feel like she only knows how to complain and act like a spoiled child who always gets her way, and I felt like screaming at her to grow up!! On the other hand we do get a little bit of information (hidden of course but it's there) and we meet more fallen angels and ""demons"" (well technically there all fallen angels but some are more fallen than others?? That is a bit crazy but...) and the outcasts (the name says it all, their not accepted anywhere and truthfully their really creepy) and we find out a bit more about the announcers. Other than that the most entertaining bit is when we meet Luce's new roommate, Shelby who is amazing (I seem to prefer the secondary characters in this series much more than the main) and amazing. Also we finally get to meet Callie (Luce's best friend) and Arriane comes back even if it's for a short period of time and I loved the thanksgiving dinner with everyone it was so funny^^",Nathiel Gold

9780385739146,I agree with most of the other reviews....the 2nd book was not as fleshy as the first book BUT still a good read that I finished in 2 days coz I couldn't wait to see where the story went (btw it didn't go very far). I don't know if it's coz I'm not a teenager but I personally find Luce quite annoying and there was a def lack of any Daniel story in this book. Like Twilight I am def team Daniel/Edward :). I'm looking forward to the 3rd book in the series as the author has stated it will fill in the entire back story of Luce and Daniel's Story - yay!! In the end; it is a good page turning story that is hard to put down but super easy to read.,Melissa Rogers
9780385739146,"Well the other reviewers had pretty much said everything but sometimes, you just need to vent the book out. I'd rate it about 3.75 stars because it wasn't too Twilightly but the aspects of it still there (I'm not a fan of Twilight at all). But one thing I do love about this book is that it introduces a love square with Luce being fought over Cam, Daniel and Miles. I am on Team Cam (if it exists) as you can tell that Cam does care for Luce in his own demonic ways and I hope that it will get explored eventually. I really do hope that Lauren Kate would not make Luce and Daniel togeather, it would just disapoint so many of her fans. If you liked Fallen then you will enjoy Torment as Luce finally gets some character development, even though the whole book is her whining about how she dosn't know everything and her pyning away for Daniel.",TinaTissue
9780385739146,Fallen and Torment! What can I say! They are a really good book. If you haven't read them then I strong suggest that you should because the adventures that Luce has is quite amazing. Well just saying that I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!!!,Claudia
9780385739146,"EDIT (as of 15/6/2011): After reading other reviews and analyzing the story again, I have to say that I am wrong about Daniel and Luce. Luce is a self-absorbed, whiny and moping twit and I pity Daniel. I think because the author focuses more on Luce's perspective and emotions, she totally neglected Daniel's and thus, making me, as a reader felt as I did based on my first impression below. I take back what I said about Daniel because after looking at it at another angle, I totally feel for him. Ain't easy falling in love with the same girl again and again while knowing you're gonna lose her anyway sooner or later; while the girl know nothing of her past(s). I'm back to Team Daniel and I hope that Luce will actually GROW UP in Passion because I do want to love this series. ____________________________________________________________ I can't believe I'm gonna say this. I'm Team Miles but I know that's not ever gonna happen. *Heart shatters into millions of pieces* I just don't feel for Daniel. I don't know. He just doesn't give me the impression. I kinda got tired of him. Seriously. I was whooping when Luce defied him and was thinking twice about her relationship with him. *Ducks for cover* Gah, I rarely feel like that or don't at all for main characters. Daniel doesn't portray the strong character to me. It's like goody goody-protective-tormented Daniel living forever in his cursed life. Sigh. I didn't hate this book. I just didn't feel deeply for it. I'm sorry Daniel. I just need you to show more stuff. More substance you know. Not just ""Hey, we're unshakable. We're the only one for each other. I can't lose you. Yada yada.."" Plssssss...I need to see more character there. Luce and Daniel don't pull me. I find myself drawn more towards the side characters instead. Jasmine and Dawn had participation in the story for the first half and then they sort of disappeared towards the end. I didn't appreciate that. I find them, Shelby, Arriane, Roland, Miles and the rest more interesting compared to the main. I fell in love with the cover of Fallen and Torment. The synopsis of the story caught mt attention but I was kinda disappointed a lil' bit after I read them. Torment was a fitting title. Luce was in torment and confusion throughout the book. I can't believe I felt so relieved after finally finishing this book. Hopefully Passion will be better.",Joy Chuah Xin Yee
9780385739160,"When I started to read this book, I jumped right back into the story like no time had passed between novels at all, which I like, it makes it easier to follow along. The characters are still quite likable but the story sort of faltered for me. I'm glad that the reader could see into their past lives (mainly Luce's) and what got them to where Daniel and Luce are today, but the ""time jumping"" was not fun to follow. Luce was far more stubborn in her quest for the truth and didn't care if she altered time to achieve what she set out to do. It made me want to reach into the book and strangle her or slap the crap out of her. As for Daniel, he was valiant as always, but always a day late, a dollar short. I kept hoping he would have gotten to her over and over again just to get the time jumping over with. What I really wanted to know is what happened with the other travelers. We saw briefly what happened to Shelby and Miles and a few seconds of Cam, but what happened when they traveled through time? Overall, it was, as always, a great novel by an amazing writer. I will be buying her fourth installment in the Fallen series to see where everything ends up. http://www.bookdepository.com/?a_aid=jumintboo-20",Erin Nation
9780385739153,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) I'm so happy I was finally able to read this! I read Fallen in 2011, but never moved on to read Torment. So this year I re-read Fallen and FINALLY dove into Torment. Though Torment wasn't as good as Fallen, it was still amazing and gave you a lot more history on things and Luce was able to find out a lot more about her past lives than she knew in the first book. Daniel, unfortunately, wasn't in it as much as I was hoping. Boo! BUT after starting the book and learning about the truce, he was in it more than I expected after all that. Which I was happy for. I love Daniel! I'm starting to like Cam again after all the crap at the end of Fallen, but I'm still team Daniel! I know a lot of people think that this series is a ""Been there, done that."" series. But I don't think so. Yes, some parts have been done before, but a lot of it is unique and extremely addicting. EXTREMELY. So much that I went ahead and ordered Passion and Rapture. You meet a lot of new characters in this book as well. Miles and Shelby, whom I absolutely ADORE! At times I was getting mad at Miles, since I'm team Daniel, but at other times I was all ""Awww..."" and falling under his spell. He's a great guy. =) Shelby is a great friend, at first I was a little annoyed by her, but as soon as she started opening up and being nice to Luce, I started really liking her. Overall, this is a great series. The writing and plot is addicting and the characters are well developed and you find yourself flipping through pages faster than you think you can even read. You go through so many emotions as well, at least I do. I'll be happy and then I'll be heart broken and it's just so emotional with Luce and Daniel and heart-wrenching at times and sometimes I really need a box of tissues sitting beside me when it involves them.",Amanda

Why does every protagonist has to to be ridiculous, weak, boring and dependent on her love interest? Honestly? And I don't understand why her love interest has to be so controlling.

9780385738934,"I was hoping that I would like this book but I unfortunately did not. We'll start with the positives, I liked that the setting of this story is not your typical high school. The atmosphere of Sword & Cross is secluded and dark. There is a sense of mystery that hangs over the dilapidated buildings and unkempt grounds of the school and it suits the mood of the story well. The students themselves are also not our typical cliques that we come across in YA books that are set in high school. Yes, Luce categorizes the students into stereotypes when she first sees them sitting outside but the minor characters she interacts with do not fall into these groups. Now the negatives, I felt Fallen could have been written about any magical creatures whether vampires, angels or elves. The protagonist, Luce was frustrating and certainly not someone I would want to deal with. She didn't feel like a worthy heroine to me, she wasn't worthy of her friend Penn who I found to be a strong, smart and witty, independent girl and she wasn't worthy of Daniel who places her above everyone else.",Sandy

9780385738934,"Luce was with Trevor the night he died. There was a fire, and only Luce came out alive. When everyone begins to question her - her parents, psychologist, the police - her answers don't satisfy them because she doesn't know. She can't remember what happened. That's how she finds herself at Sword & Cross, a reform school. Things get off to a rough start. Before her first class, she gets flipped off. By lunchtime, she runs into the bathroom crying, her hair and shirt covered in that day's meal. But soon she finds a few friends and begins to settle in. However, she is far from being able to rest easily. The ""shadows"" that have haunted her for the majority of her life seem to be making appearances more and more often, and she doesn't know why. They've gotten bolder, and now instead of simply skirting around and following her, they occasionally surround her, even touching her. One day, when the shadows come, Daniel, a fellow student, walks into the room, and they quickly move away. There is something hauntingly familiar about Daniel Grigori, but Luce can't figure out what it is. He appears in her dreams, dreams so vivid they feel real, as if they were something she had actually experienced. She wants to talk to him, figure out exactly why he can make the shadows go away, why it feels like she knows him, but he keeps her at a far distance. Things get progressively more dangerous as the days wear on. Luce feel an inexplicable draw to Daniel and won't stop trying to find out more about him and his past. If only she knew the truth about herself and him. The truth that she and Daniel can never, ever be together. FALLEN is an incredibly intriguing book, fraught with delicious suspense. The mystery seems to never abate, instead growing with each and every chapter. I felt like I might explode from the tension.

9780385738934,"Fallen, by Lauren Kate, is a story about how love never dies, no matter how much time passes. It's about many life times of struggle and restraint, and having to continuously repeat it after every certain amount of years, whether you want to or not. Even after centuries of searching and waiting, just for it all to end the same again. Wouldn't you have given up by now? Wouldn't you have rather fallen?

It seems to be that she's done this novel too much in the hopes of turning it into a script. It would be great as a movie, but as a book it really let me down. The worst part was the repetition, continuously describing things which have already been said. The part where Bill is hiding when an angel is present. He said this earlier in the book, and she's constantly wondering why he's left. This character was made out to be less intelligent than she was in the earlier books. This book is important to the series, which had been alright so far. Hopefully the fourth novel is better written.",Natalie Cleary
9780385618083,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Okay, I know a lot of people have had issues with this book. But I didn't. I loved it. I know that it's basically just Luce stepping in and out of Announcers in different times and places, but I loved seeing her past lives with Daniel. I loved seeing them fall in love so deeply each time, it was so romantic. As you should already know if you've read the first two books (Which you better have if you're reading this review!!!), Daniel has had to watch Luce die over, and over, and over again with each reincarnation. He falls in love with her as a different person, with the same soul, each time and she falls in love with him and just as they start to proclaim that love, poof. She dies. It's so tragic, but such a romantic tragic love story. Also, in this third installment, you get to read Daniel's point-of-view. Every other chapter is Daniel's. I really loved seeing through his eyes and getting an insight on his feelings and the way he thinks. It also adds a lot to the history of him and Luce, and the fallen angels. The only thing that I can remember really bugging me was the fact that it seemed like Luce STILL needed to know about her love with Daniel after so many past lives. She knew after so many of them that their love was true, and she kept whining about missing him. I know, though, that this book was about learning about the past with them. But I hated how she basically whined through the whole thing. And ugh, Bill. I knew something was up with him as soon as Luce met him. I was always suspicious of him, even when I kind of liked how he helped Luce. But the whole time I was waiting for him to do something. Not going to go into too much detail about him, ha. Or I'll give away everything with him and rant on and on and on about how...nevermind! Overall, I loved this installment. I'm dying to read Rapture, but I want to save some time and read Fallen in Love. I'm really sad that Rapture is the last book. These books make me cry so hard. They make my heart hurt. The writing flows well and you fly through SO many pages so fast, even though the chapters are super long. Which I don't mind in these books. If you haven't tried this series yet, please do! I know a lot of people stay away from them because they are the type that is either a love, or a hate relationship. Can't be so-so about it, or at least I haven't seen anybody with a ""Ooh, yeah I liked it. It was okay."" feeling about it.",Amanda
9780385618083,"Well, I flew through Passion, finishing in less than a day. I didn't want to put it down, and I needed to know what would come next. Passion wasn't really what I expected... while in theory we got to see some of their romances and where the love is coming from in their past encounters, I really wanted at least one start to finish meeting and falling in love. What I got instead was interesting, and it really helps to see where Daniel's immense love comes from, and get to know him and where he's been. What Luce got from it was more of a sense of who she is, and she has to learn and convince herself that their love is from something real, not just fate or simple attraction. This is a good addition to the series, and I know that I'll pick up the last and hope that all the threads are tied up and something happens with a bang.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780385618083,"Passion was great book, pretty much exactly what I wanted, language can be a little confusing and the story could be better in places. not as good as Fallen, way better than torment. definitely an awesome read for Fallen fans :)",Naomi Impellizzeri
9780385618120,I liked this bo ok but it wasn't one of my favourites. In the fallen series this is the order : 1. Fallen 2. Torment 3. Passion 4. Fallen in love 5. Rapture fallen is my favourite. I think apture is good but I hated the ending. It annoyed me. I like the climax to the ending though. Overall I rate it a 4 out of 5. I recomened the Fallen series.,stephanie
9780385618120,"I had been eagerly awaiting this final book in the Fallen series and it did not disappoint me because it was full of everything I have come to expect from this fantastic series - romance, action, complications and so many difficult decisions! I quickly fell back in to the story and couldn't put it down, this book now joins the many other books in my 'one-day read' list. Cam has always been one of my favourite characters in this series and that didn't change this time, he still had that confident charm that I love so much and part of me has always hoped that he might become something more to Luce. As I was reading through this book there was a real feeling of urgency from everyone, complicated angel politics led to an exciting and tense race against time which had me on the edge of my seat. Dee was an interesting character, I wasn't sure what to make of her but when her purpose was revealed I was actually quite surprised that I hadn't seen it coming. Being the last book in the series I knew it would be dramatic but I wasn't prepared for some of the sad moments that occurred during the battle to save history, I didn't expect to find myself crying whilst reading this book but there were a couple of things that really pulled at my heart-strings. It was good to finally get an explanation for everything and it wasn't anything I had predicted either which was refreshing. The epilogue was brilliant but still held a touch of sadness for me, the only negative thing I would say is that I would have liked more of it! An action-packed, emotional read that finished off the series beautifully.",Kate Verrier
9780385618120,"""Tell them it's happening. That an endgame has been initiated"" First of all I want to say the most positive thing about this book. The Cover. I abso-freakin'-lutely love the covers of the fallen series' books! Their covers, together with the interesting plot of the first book, lured me into reading this series. And to be honest, I'm glad it's done... Luce and Daniel's romance is weird, and I don't like it. It's so enormously cheesy! Daniel's love is 'everlasting' and Luce's love is destroying her. Literally! But their romance is the most important thing in the universe. The difference between good and bad. One tiny decision, and it could ruin everything. There was some action in this book, which I kinda liked, but most of it ended with Luce and Daniel kissing because they didn't lose each other and whatever. But I guess some people like that stuff. Not me, I'm not that kind of girl... The struggle between good and evil is a commonly written about subject. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. With the fallen series, I'm not sure whether I like it or not. I love the whole fallen angel thing, since they are such mysterious creatures, and their struggle between good and evil is fascinating, but still, that the entire series is centered around a tragic romance is not what I was looking for. Since this was the conclusion to the Fallen series, I was expecting answers to all my questions. And I had a lot of them! Most of them were about Cam, Arianne and Roland, my 3 favorite characters from this series. But I didn't get my answers. And that's what dissatisfied me a lot about this book. I was expecting more. Again, the cheesy romance was my main problem. Here's a short quote that states the whole problem: ""All he knew was that being seperated from Lucinda was not a punishment that he could endure. They had to be together."" Altogether I will give this book 2 stars. A book I would recommend only to the fallen fandom and other people who have read and liked the other installments in this series.",Margot E
9780385618021,"I really liked this book, i recommend it to people how love romance and fantasy books. If you liked books like twilight and vampire acdememy or even city of bones, id say most likely you would love this book! even my friend likes this book and she NEVER reads, i swear even though she was obsessed with twilight she didnt even read the books!!!! definently worth 5 stars!",Jemma
9780385618021,"The saying goes ""Never judge a book by its cover,"" and it definatley applies here. The cover looks very promising and alluring to those who are interested in sci fi/urban fantasy. It definatley is the first thing that intrigued me to read the book and the second being I saw it ""recommended."" After a few chapters, I found myself struggling to read it. But being the trooper I am, I continued in the hopes of reaching the climax which would just make everything fall into place. Alas this did not happen. In comparison to other books available on the market under this catergory, this book was a big disappoint, leaving you unsure and not as well as informed as a reader would like to be. It is obvious the reader has left alot of information out of this book, in order to put in the books coming in the series. [assumption] Unfortunatley in doing this, she has failed to captivate the reader by not supplying enough detail. The lack of depth despite the length of the book does the book no justice. (For instance, the reason behind why the leading female character Luce has ended up in a reform school is made mention too throughout the book, but it doesn't go into any great detail of what happened in that particular event.) It takes 3/4 of the book to reach any kind of climax. And even when all the ""action"" starts to take place it still lacks the depth of character to pull you into the book. Nothing is obvious in this book and even though the author has tried to make it seem that way. It leaves you questioning whether you missed something or lack understanding of the content. The lack of character build up is the main thing that a reader may find disheartening. The secondary characters are much more interesting then the main. Although it is a love story there doesn't seem to be much love in it. It's more based on lust and rejection until the very end. Even the epliogue leaves you wondering ""what the..."" So will I be reading any future books in the series? Definatley! I find it so annoying having read the book and left wondering so much. So I think any future books will be necessary just to fill in the blanks!",Amanda
9780385618021,"In the beginning he would search for her, when he didn't find her she would find him. In every life they would come together only to be torn apart. They were in love. They were domed. Time and time again he would lose her, and she would die. Time and time again he would remember and she would forget. It was always the same. Until now... Ever since she can remember, Lucinda has seen things no one else can. Shadows. Luce had always feared them, but they had always kept their distance. Until the day they got too close and took a life. After the 'accident' things changed. People looked at her differently, with fear, even her parents. And Lucinda was sent away. Stepping through the gates of Sword & Cross was like stepping into another world. On her first day at reform school Luce met a boy. He was cold and aloof, but somehow mesmerising. Was she crazy or had they met before? But no matter how many times he told her she was, she was sure she was not crazy. Fallen is the story of an age old battle, one that has been reining since the beginning of time, one that will last to the end. The fate of all eternal souls rests in the hands of a pair of star-crossed-lovers. And Lucinda and Daniel are as domed and as much in love as Romeo and Juliet. Natural and flowing language guides Lucinda through a new and thrilling world, where the only thing that's more important than survival is love. For all those who have had enough of vampires, now there are angels. And waiting for what happens next will be Torment.",Larissa McGrath
9780385618021,"As much as I want to just gush about this book I will endeavour to keep myself in check and write a succinct review as to exactly why I enjoyed this book so much. The story starts with a mystery, page turning suspense and intrigue. The reader is automatically drawn into the female protagonists life, thoughts and feelings from the outset. The characters are well written and their interaction was completely believable and often humorous. My heart was pounding with the passion and longing that Luce (the main character) felt. The descriptions were detailed and brought vivid pictures to my imagination. I actually had chills at the description of the shadows (no plot spoilers here). My love of Classic Literature references was fully satisfied with the use of Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno both of which reinforced the main storyline and also added an extra dimension of plot. Religious references abound, the description of a snake passing while Luce bit into an apple was a stroke of genius. Clever plot teasers are placed throughout the book, making this a book that you can read time & time again and still find new things. This for me brings it right up there with The Twilight Saga as it to has all these little plot teasers that you do not necessarily pick up on the first reading. Dramatic ending has really left me gasping for more. I adore the thought of eternal soul mates and the great battle of good versus evil. I was able to lose myself completely in this story. A sign of good descriptive writing. For me this book has it all romance, suspense, intrigue and surprising plot twists. I rank it alongside The Twilight Saga (Vampires), The Wicked Lovely Series (Faeries) and now Fallen (Angels). In conclusion a terrific book for those that like supernatural romance and losing themselves in fantasy. I sincerely hope this review was not too gushing, or if it was that I had valid points to make about why I am gushing.",Emma Davies
9780385618021,"I started this story already knowing what the characters were... It is pretty obvious - the book is marketed in a way that tells you what they are, but I don't think that this lessened my reading enjoyment at all. Speaking of knowing what the characters are - I loved their names (and they are a great hint if you don't already know who is who and what is what). I also love Lauren Kate's writing style. Though nothing much really happens until the last 150 pages, you don't feel like there's nothing happening. The story and characters are so engrossing that you don't even realize there hasn't really been any action yet. Kate's writing draws you in to become Luce, to feel exactly what she is feeling which is quite an achievement considering it is written in third person. Despite it being quite a sad, dark novel, there are some great humorous moments too. Luce herself is a very intriguing and likable character. Her past and the reason she ends up in reform school are very sad and dark. Normally I'm not a big fan of the whole ""love-at-first-sight, we're-meant-to-be-together-despite-how-badly-I-treat-you"" thing, but in Fallen I like it. The reason it works well is that there is an actual reason for the love at first sight, and there's a very, very, very good reason for the bad treatment. Fallen also had some surprising twists along the way. I thought I had the story all figured out then I would reach a big twist. Afterward I could see all the clues that hinted this was going to happen and couldn't believe I hadn't known! This story doesn't have a fairytale ending either, which I think is a good thing. The ending is quite sad and leaves lots of questions which I hope will be answered in the sequel Torment which is due for release in September this year. Overall I am giving Fallen 5 out of 5 because I simply can't think of any reason not to! I recommend it to all lovers of fantasy and romance.",Amy Mansell
9780758267610,"Angel Betrayed is the second in The Fallen series by Cynthia Eden. The Fallen series is about angels that fall because they develop human feelings and end up breaking their laws. Sammael the Death Angel chose to take the souls of some men that hurt women and children. He then fell from heaven and has lived on the earth for centuries. In Angel of Darkness (the first in the Fallen Series) we meet Selina O'Shaw and we get a glimpse of how Sam feels about her. In this book, Selina approaches Sam to return a favor. That is the start of their adventure and romance. As a fan of Ms. Eden's book I have to say that Angel Betrayed is one of her best! I love the depth that she gives her characters and the exciting plot made this a book I didn't want to put down! I totally recommend that you read Angel of Darkness before you read Angel Betrayed. I think it will give you the background you need so you too can fall in love with this book.",Dani Chapman

9780007420421,"Hellow, Divergent is known as one of the bests YA dystopian books nowadays, although I prefer other genres last week or so I decided to give it a chance since dystopian as been a desire of mine lately. I have to say I was not very much disappointed , although I didn't get a great dystopian book, I still got a very engaging action packed story to delight myself with and well, that was enough for the time being. Why I say that this is no dystopian? Well, although there is a little of world building and it's not bad at all, it didn't have the most important thing a book of this genre must have, a sense of despair. After all we are talking about a dying society on the pick of coming back alive, there was not that political or moral sense to it, the struggle seemed just empty and not enough. The beginning, specially faction wise, it's quite confusing and not very well explained, that being said I say this book lacks a lot of explanations overall. Other than that I must say the action it's perfectly described and that the author has an amazing hand for fight scenes. Although I didn't fell in love with none of the characters on this plot I still had the need of following the story through. It's one of that books that keeps you hanging on, very movie like( maybe that was why Summit signed ). There is not much to say about it, it was not good on the literary spectrum but it was still very fun and enjoyable so , yes , it is a 3.5 starts Regards Yours sincerely, Skeleton Orchid",SkeletonOrchid

9780007444113,"YOU CAN SEE THIS REVIEW AND MORE LIKE IT AT: http://the-fiction-faerie.blogspot.com.au/ Heres my take on it. I just finished it about a half hour ago. This wasn't the best book Ive ever read. For me, it seemed to lack that climactic feeling that I look forward to in the ending of a series or trilogy. But I still really enjoyed this book and thought it was an appropriate ending to the story. I usually finish books in a few hours. I zipped right through Divergent and Insurgent when each of those came out. But Allegiant took me a few days to read, because I just could not get into the story. It was boring, slow-paced, and lacked the action of the previous books. The dual POV (point of view) made matters worse because I'd often forget if I was in Tris' or Tobias' POV, and I had to go back multiple times to check. I'm curious, did anyone actually like the dual POV? I understand why it was necessary, but it wasn't effective at all. Their internal voices were identical. The plot itself was where I took the most offense though. It was cliched, convoluted, tried too hard to address every single loose thread while just creating many more, and it ultimately never reached any sort of exciting climax. Like others have said, I struggled to feel invested in this story (unlike the prior two novels, which I couldn't put down!) and felt like I was always waiting for something exciting to happen, which ultimately never came. Overall this wasn't the worst YA fiction book out but it could have been better. Way better. It wasn't predictable like I had thought it would be but not necessary in a good way.",Rachel Nichols
9780062024022,"Favourite Quote: C/??It must require bravery to be honest all the time. I wouldnC/??t know.C/?? After re-reading this book for a 3rd or 4th time, I thought I better write a review this time! Even after re-reading this book several times, it still remains my favourite dystopian book! 5/5 stars! The thing I love most about this book is Dauntless! Everything about that faction just excites, amazes, stuns me and even though it has its flaws I still think it would be the faction that IC/??d love to live in! As for the rest of the world building, I thought it was done extremely well and I understand all the politics and reasoning for the society, which sometimes is hard to understand in other dystopians! To be honest this whole society just blows me away, I think it was so creative! Onto the characters, I just love Tris as she is one strong heroine and never gives up. Even when she isnC/??t at her strongest and shows vulnerability, I still love her because even her weakest moments she wants to be strong. Then thereC/??s Four, who I just love! He has to be my top book crush, he is everything I could want! Strong, smart, brave, can be sweet when he want and to many thing other things to write! As for the relationship between the pair, I didnC/??t think it was cheesy or overdone, I thought it formed at a steady pace and was realistic. As for the other characters, Veronica Roth definitely knows how to make various characters three dimensional. There were characters I absolutely hated, and there were ones I loved, but above all these characters are very memorable and that is how you know the author created great characters. As for the plot, the pacing was fast and there was also action every few pages! This book had everything C/?? action, romance, friendship, a corrupt society, and so much more! Overall I just love it and highly recommend it too everything! Ps. The movie was AMAZING!",brookexx
9780062024022,"3 reviews . . . Chrissy's 4-star review Did I enjoy this book: I did enjoy this book. I read it every free chance I had. The last half had me glued to my book. The first half took a bit to get through. I could put the book down during that and not have to pick it up again. Tris is a fantastic heroine. She is up there with the best of them -- Katniss and Hermione. (Sadly, I can only think of two right now off the top of my head.) She finds strength, power, knowledge, courage. Finds may be the wrong word. She always had it in her. She just didn't know it. Her love interest is great. Four is such a gem. I loved the cake comment. (Read the book. You'll understand.) They aren't sappy and it definitely wasn't insta-love. I got to see it develop. It was sweet. (This next part isn't a spoiler but it will be cryptic.) I was surprised by the ending and how fast it all wrapped up. The ending made me sad. I would have loved to know more about some people. I was surprised by the actions of some people. I wasn't surprised by those of others. But I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. Would I recommend it: Absolutely. Will I read it again: Probably, but first I want to read the rest of the series. Melissa's 4-star review Did I enjoy this book: Yep! It's not the next Mistborn series, but I'd wager Roth's books will end up ranked among the likes of Twilight and The Hunger Games. Her writing's not spectacular but her story is. Her plotlines aren't quite original but her characters are. Her dystopia's not...um... well, actually it IS. It's awesome. It's Harry Potter's Sorting Hat only without the cheering. It's dark, and grown-up, and exactly what I was hoping for. The internet tells me I ought to have low expectations for the second and third installments of Roth's series, but at this point I'm confident enough to hope for the best. Would I recommend it: Yep! Will I read it again: No, but I'm off to read book 2 just as soon as I get the chance. Belinda's 5-star review Did I enjoy this book: Yes. Divergent is flawless. Considering the attention the book has received coupled with the imminent blockbuster movie to be released, you probably already knew that. This story covers all the inevitable scary issues involved in growing up; separating from our parents, discovering where we belong, deciding who to trust, and learning to thrive in a dangerous and frightening world. Roth has it all. It's perfect . . . for a younger crowd. I fear there is a huge age gap between those who will undoubtedly be enthralled by this story and those who will say: It's good. It's entertaining. It's a work of art. And I couldn't relate to any of it. Reading this book made me feel like the stereotypical old fart. It's ok. I like being an old fart. This story reminded me how hard growing up is. I managed to survive all that. Well, I didn't have to go to war against my own neighborhood, but metaphorically at least, I survived the challenges represented in the book. Shew! Don't want to do it again; not even in fiction. Would I recommend it: Absolutely. Will I read it again: No.",Chrissy
9780062024022,"I don't really know what I can say about this book that hasn't been said hundreds of times before. But as it's one of my favourite book series and I have just reread it in time for Allegiant, I am going to review it for the blog anyway. Divergent is an amazing read, at least in my opinion. It gave me everything I could possibly ask for in a book, an amazing dystopian setting, a kick-ass female lead who just so happens to be short (as a fellow short person, I like this!), a great male lead who even I can fall for and twists and turns I don't see coming. Not to mention some rather amazing secondary characters that I really came to love. As far as main characters go, Tris was kind of perfect as far as I'm concerned. I think the reason I loved her so much was because of how hard she had to work. She wasn't amazing from the get go, she wasn't the best initiate, it was something she had to work for. I really liked that about her, it can get frustrating having characters who are the best at everything all the time. Plus, as I've said she is also tiny which is nice to find in a lead character! Next I must talk about Four - Four, Four, Four, Four!!! As far as love interest and male lead characters go, Four is actually swoon worthy to me and I never swoon. He was tough, mysterious but also caring and funny. I totally fell for Four in this book and Four will always be Four to me - I don't care if it's a nickname! As far as secondary characters go, Veronica Roth can really do no wrong. She gave me Tris' friends to love, her enemies to absolutely despise and those characters that keep you guessing. Dystopian fiction is my favourite genre and I can't seem to get enough of it. The factions in the book were something I really enjoyed and found really interesting. Even if I would have liked a tiny bit more explanation on them - when they were formed, why they were formed and how it all works. One great thing about this book, no stupid, annoying, frustrating love triangle. I am surely not the only person who is fed up of seeing these in books. Divergent is one of my all time favourites and the ending gets me every time I read it. This book was completely heartbreaking to me at times. When you finish it leaves you needing to know what happens next, thankfully all three books are out now so you won't have to wait. 5/5 Stars If you're looking for dystopian fiction with amazing characters, kick-ass action and a great romance then this is definitely for you!",Reviews from a Bookworm
9780062024022,"I am helplessly and utterly in love with this book. Divergent is one of those books that's like ""Oh, you wanna go outside and play? Here's a twist. Here's some action. Forget about outside"". Beatrice is struggling to find the good choice, the good faction for her, but is there such thing? Every faction has its ups and downs. I liked the fact that I could easily remember the characters. I have quite a problem with character remembering, especially when tons of them are thrown in my face - which is a reason I never finished Hamlet -but with Divergent is easy to recall even those who were only mentioned once. You stumble upon the best male character you can ever read. How do I begin to describe Four? I love him with the power of a thousand suns. He's the kind of boyfriend that brings the best of you, makes you stronger, because when you're down, he doesn't look at you with pity, what would pity solve? He's the kind of man that's intelligent, not thirsty for power and despite his age, his maturity is off the charts. And he has muscles. It's such an easy read, since intrigues over intrigues keep showing up and leave you wanting more. The world Veronica Roth described with such passion has definitely left a mark on me, because you're there with the character, you're there seeing through her eyes and despite the drawbacks, it's a beautiful world. I simply cannot WAIT to read Insurgent!! I recommend this book, it's a must read, really.. There's nothing not to like. Action, twists, romance and a well written story... what more do you want?",Ioana Culcea
9780062024022,"I absolutely love this book! I read many reviews raving about how great this book was, so I decided to read it myself. If you like The Hunger Games trilogy you will absolutely love this book!! I am currently on the second book: Insurgent!",Sengul Korkmaz

It has similarities to the hunger games but Divergent is a level of its self i loveeeed this book so much i read it in 1 day i just couldn't do anything but read it! Veronica makes a connection with all the characters to make us feel for them and worry what will happen to them. And let me just say OMG Four! Where can i get one!?

9780062024046,"DIVERGENT drowned me in a pool of emotions with all its life-changing events, the shock of sudden losses and the unique connection between Tris and Four. INSURGENT continues our story seemlessly right where DIVERGENT left off. Tris and Four are granted a few quiet moments in which the damage of the past hours and days can fully sink in. Yet the unpredictability and the explosive potential of the story didn?C/C/?!C/?C/t change at all. Although things seem calm, pandemonium can break out at any second. Another attack thrown by the enemies, another secret bringing our lovers farther apart. You never know what's waiting behind a new page turned. Tris and Four are put under a huge pressure to not only save the entire nation, but to save their relationship and themselves. After the tragic events of DIVERGENT, Tris cannot return to being the person she once was. Veronica Roth took Tris on an inevitable journey to finding her true self in the chaos of war. Defining who she can rely on, who are her enemies and what she has to make out of everything for herself, Tris goes through an enormous character transformation. Her character appears one of the weakest and at the same time strongest YA heroines I had the pleasure to meet. She's a very ambivalent character. At times I just wanted to shake her for her stolidity and her inability to stop herself from acting without thinking about her friends and boyfriend first. She also made me admire her for her humanity in times of lack thereof. Thanks to a brilliantly written 1st person narrator, Tris' journey grips you and integrates you into her thoughts and her story as if it were your own. Tobias, or Four as I still prefer to call him, is definitely one of my favourite YA male characters out there. He always seemed just as strong as Tris and their equality is what makes them such a natural couple to me. They can always rely on the other and their reasons for choosing the other to be their best friend, their love make them so true. But INSURGENT wouldn?C/C/?!C/?C/t be the second book in a series, if the tension between the two of them wasn?C/C/?!C/?C/t building. It seems inevitable with all the inner conflicts and outer battles going on, but somehow it just didn?C/C/?!C/?C/t feel right to me. Tris and Four fighting. They are both two very powerful personalities, but I didn?C/C/?!C/?C/t want to see them fight and their disagreements honestly started to annoy me at some point. Is it so wrong that the peace-loving me just wanted to see them be happy and have swoon-worthy moments? Well, the rational me knew there just had to be something to come in their way. Sometimes INSURGENT and its bombastically constructed story held the potential for an information overload. There is just so much happening at once and so much information to process. So don't be afraid to take reading breaks and the time to think about everything that's happening. Give your pulse a chance to calm down. Veronica Roth always seems to find exactly the right words to make a character like Uriah appear cocky, yet loyal. Four, one of the most relentless fighters among the Dauntless, a sweetly loving boyfriend. Tris such a tough hero and on the inside an emotionally torn daughter, sister, friend, girlfriend. Christina, Peter, Eric, Tori, Caleb, Marcus, Marlene, Lynn just perfect the way they are. Don?C/C/?!C/?C/t let me get started. You see I?C/C/?!C/?C/m in love with every character, this series and Veronica Roth for being so talented. 4,5/5 ****/* INSURGENT - A gigantic character cast, an expansive world building and the extensive web of relationships make INSURGENT such a stunningly successful sequel! Very clever, very complex. A read that challenges your brain cells, your moral beliefs, your heart, demanding the ability to read concentratedly and patiently through 525 pages of a story that equals TNT. Veronica Roth's DIVERGENT trilogy stands out of the YA fiction branch as something entirely new and brilliant!",MissPageTurner
9780062024046,"I reviewed it on my booklikes blog page http://aniashuk.booklikes.com/post/129629/it-gets-better-and-better-and-better- Maybe, my review is huge, but deal with it:) ""Insurgent,"" he says. ""Noun. A person who acts in opposition to the established authority, who is not necessarily regarded as a belligerent."" One day, Veronica Roth have decided to write a book. And it was one of her best decisions ever! So, THANK YOU, Veronica!!! You're in my Top Favourite Authors list now and I think carefully while adding someone there, because things like that is really important to me. (Perks of being a booklover:) OK, lets get to the point. I've finished this book on July, 16 and could properly write about it only weeks after that. Yes, that's true. After reading the last word I couldn't even speak normally to say nothing about writing. I could just say ""WHAT???"" ""WHAAAAAAAAAT?"" :) As usually, I won't spoil anything, but what I can tell is it was one of the HUGEST cliffhangers, I've ever read...And when I turned the page with eyes like that O__O to see what will happen next and found ""Acknowledgement""...OH MY!!! I was home alone and literally shouted ""WHAAAT?"", ""HOW?"", ""WHAT?""...Now I can't wait for ""Allegiant"" and it'll come out only in October...jeez. What am I supposed to do? I still haven't got used to waiting for the next book. Because here, where I live, we usually got whole series translated all at once. (well, I'm talking about series that I read). I'll try to keep this review shorter, 'cos as you may know, I can speak (write) for aaaaages:) I really liked to know more about factions and Chicago itself here (I've never been to Chicago, so now I have an interesting image in my head. Lets hope that I won't be jumping about every sound there and won't turn my head like crazy searching for danger, because in some moments this book was intense like that and it imprinted in my memory, I'm sure.). Now I knew more about relations between factions, their views on each other, more about their leaders (well, for factions that have ones), more about past. And I like that in books. [ That is what series exist for (one of the reasons) - you'll know more and more with each book. 1st book will ignite a desire to read this series in you, will tell you basics and show you few flashbacks. And then the 2nd one will open up a whole picture, it'll be deeper and even stronger, and you won't be able to put in down, because ""WHAT'S NEXT, MAN?"". And finally the 3rd one. It will wrap the whole thing up, often with freaking wtf moments (it's dystopian novel, dude). And don't tell me it's not true (look at The Hunger Games, this series description is basically fits there, too. Good for me, then:)) My attempt to become a bookish philosopher] I want to say, that with this book i got few massive bonuses: -- I got 2 favourite supporting characters, that I can add to my Top Supporting Characters List (it's all about lists, maaan). I'm writing about Zeke and Uriah, Oooooh, I LOVE THOSE TWO! They gave me this ""Aaaaw!"" moment ^.^ in book and I really appreciate that (love those moments). SUPER! -- I was surprised by some characters (no spoilers, but P...surprise, surprise...), and it was pleasant surprises. -- LOVE BONUS. Because Four. (Do I need to explane this? Nuh, I think I don't) :) Well, about love. Relationship between Tris and Four in Insurgent was in most parts like a GIANT roller-coaster, but that's O.K. It looks more realistic like that. (But in some parts I honestly thought that ""they'll punch each other in the face now"". Tension, tension..). EMOTIONS, guys, EMOTIONS! Four.....(I'd still marry him at the earliest opportunity....yes. Top Man!) There're also some moments when I thought that Tris is sobbing too much, but then I tried to put myself in her shoes. And what I can tell you, is that I'm not sure I wouldn't curl and coccon myself like a freaking butterfly if such situations happen in my like (God forbid). So, I think that readers should try to understand characters better before judging them. This thought helped me a lot. There were few unexpected deaths, and I wasn't well prepared for them. But what can we do, right? It happens a lot in books like this one. So, I think that I should be awared next time. And, finally, award for Biggest Disappointment - Caleb! I won't tell you why, you have to figure it out yourself (maybe you won't even feel the way I felt, who knows?!). But I was reeeealy frustrated and sometimes even annoyed by him. Didn't expact that... O.K., fellaz. I gave this book 5/5 [*****] stars on Goodreads, and I wish I could give it more (but it's a maximum and It's a pity!). AMAZING BOOK! Hope that waiting for ""Allegiant"" will pass easily. Hope you're reading your next favourite book now. Wish you all the best and DFTBA! P.S. About my copy: -language: Russian -format: Hardback (with original cover art) -pages: 448 -publisher: Eksmo -where have I got it? Bought it for myself:).

9780062024046,"So... I had already forgotten stuff, and this one picks right up where Divergent left off, so it took me a few pages to get back into the story and slowly remember little details. LOL. At first I was like who IS Tobias, then I was like DUH. I was just used to him being called Four. Tris was a wild card in this one though. I know its guilt, fear, and the different factions warring in her head, but at times I liked her and others I wished I could smack some sense into her. She takes risks without thinking about the gain and sometimes that puts those she loves in more danger because of it. But she is still strong, and loyal. Everything she does, she does it out of love, loyalty and her view of the greater good. It is just hard though when she is taking those risks and being self sacrificing because you know that it won't go down a good road. It was hard reading about Four and Tris in this one though. They had moments where they seemed to really belong together and then the next second they are lying to each other and constantly hiding things. So I am torn because I overall really like Four and he is a bright spot for me, and I know I can't expect anyone to be perfect especially in a world that is so torn, but there are some moments where I didn't like that side of him that I saw. On the other hand, there were some very hot moments between them then more that were so sweet, so I hope we are just seeing both of the characters grow and change and that they will come out the other side. There is some really dark stuff in this book, and more characters don't make it until the end. So it is very emotional and Tris hardly ever gets a moment reprieve. And, oh holy traitor. I can't say much obviously without spoiling but I COULD NOT believe it. I could've strangled him. There were some that I expected, but this one. NO. I loved learning and seeing more of the factions in their day to day and also how they respond when faced with violence and when it is time to make a stand for what it right. The ending sent me for a loop and I can't wait for the next book. Bottom Line: 2nd in a series that connected me more with the characters and left me wanting more.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780062024046,"Insurgent picked up right where Divergent left off which made it nice to read them one after the other. Divergent was good and set up the world really well, but I liked the conflict in Insurgent much better. The factions are so interesting and we get to learn more about the factions Amity and Candor. I love how the factions are this weird combination of a gang, an entire culture of dress and style, mannerisms and education training for a job. The books only skim the surface of all there is to know of this complex and detailed world. This is one of those worlds where they could write an encyclopedia about it and you'd still want to know more. The writing style was much better in this book. I didn't notice the word ""I"" glaring at me so much. Tris doesn't always make good decisions. In fact, she makes some really, really bad decisions but I felt like I understood her so well that I got why she did the things she did even if it's not what I would do. My favorite thing about Insurgent was how well the author messed with your expectations of who is good and who is not. And it's not based just on who Tris likes. I kind of saw the twist at the end coming, but it still gave me chills when I read it. This was a fast read and I couldn't put it down. It left me with some deep thoughts about how easily your virtues can become a vice if you're not careful. I loved the complex idea and story arc. It was an intense, action-packed ride that had me saying ""Wow"" when I closed the book.",Jessica B
9780062024046,"Originally reviewed on my blog: http://sikbookreviews.blogspot.ca The second book of Veronica Roth's trilogy, Insurgent begins right where Divergent left off, with no boring introduction that a lot of series books tend to have. War is now prominent, factions are torn apart, and evil people are looming. In this book, Tris faces many obstacles, including being betrayed, relationships issues with Four, having to publicly acknowledge her divergence, and utilizing her divergence to help fight against the powerful Erudite and the Dauntless traitors. Roth takes the reader on a journey of action, surprising twists and turns, and emotion. First of all, I love that the novel begins right where the first one left off. It is a nice change from most sequels. As with Divergent, I love the uniqueness of the title. What is ""insurgent"" anyway? Well... Google dictionary defines ""insurgent"" as ""rising in active revolt"" See, I told you I know how to use a dictionary! I am an English major, after all. But, I'm not afraid to admit when I don't know what a particular word means (such as divergent and insurgent before I felt the need to look them up!). I gave this book an 8.5 instead of a 9 like Divergent got, because...well...let's just say I'm a sucker for romance. And this book did not have Four in it as much as the first. Don't get me wrong, I do not want the entire book to be about a love story...that would be too much. The first book was a good mix of romance and action-packed adventure. I just wish this one was the same. I also felt sad a lot, because Tris and Four seemed very disconnected throughout the novel. Pathetic, I know! But, that's just my opinion and I am a romantic at heart. I also enjoyed the fact that there were twists that were actually shocking to me! I hate it when I see things coming, which does happen. It is refreshing to not really have predicted anything that happened in this book. I had no idea what was coming at the end (what information Tris was going to find out, if any). I didn't know how Tris was going to get out of certain sticky situations. This was a really nice and surprising aspect of Roth's creative mind and writing. Lastly, the ending was very well done as well. As I said, it was pretty surprising. But more than that, Insurgent - like that of Divergent - ended with a bang, barely stopping the action to end. It leaves the reader wanting more and desperately wanting to read the third book right now. I know I do! A part of me wishes I would have waited until all three of the trilogy were out before reading them...but, oh well, what's done is done. And I did enjoy them. I will be waiting with bated breath for the final book in this captivating trilogy!",Sam
9780007420414,"Attention, this is an eulogy, consider me DIVERGENT fan for life! This book is not as good as expected, but dimensions better! Beatrice or Tris is the type of plain character that is soon noticed as the honest and adoring girl that she really is. She has a super honest voice that I cannot but adore. For Tris her whole life depends on one single choice. Thinking about the events of DIVERGENT it overwhelms me that they all depend from that one single moment. For the male protagonist, let me use four simple letters: L-O-V-E! DIVERGENT has a character cast that covers all imaginable profiles, some are honest, some cruel, full of hatred. Then there are amiable , compassionate, strong, intelligent, brave characters. One should mean that one novel can not cover every single character type or segment of emotions, but Veronica Roth did a very good job by writing DIVERGENT. I fell head over heels for DIVERGENT and its revolutionary characters. It's one of the very first novels that totally got me without a love triangle. At no point do the story, the actions or dialogues appear forced. In DIVERGENT affection is beautiful in its simplicity. DIVERGENT sets you under a current flow of electricity that feels so incredibly good. Each word seems to be just in the right place, forming ideal sentences that together result in an adventurous read. In the middle of this action-packed novel that tries to cope with the raw instincts describing men, the coruptness of a society, we find ourselves attracted by a love story that is easy and endlessly beautiful at the same time. Veronica Roth has a sense for the perfect interaction between time,space and characters. I can honestly call her one of the best present YA authors, because she finds the perfect balance between natural romantce and nerve-racking action. Veronica Roth is one of my new favourite authors, she is highly-qualified, her writing is super engaging and her words deeply touching and electrifying. Her writing talent is realised 100 %. This novel has not one single page that not had my full and undivided attention. Word for word stole my heart. If I talked about this novel in a chat, the wide emoticon palette would not be sufficient to describe my experienced emotions while reading this novel. When I start thinking about books I wish I had written myself because of their pure brilliance, DIVERGENT immediately pops into my mind. This world is so well-constructed, I wish I would live in it. Want to know what DIVERGENT stands for? Dedicated-intelligent-romantic-gigantic-engaging novel to crave! THE VERDICT A debut novel you won't forget too soon. When some people think of dystopian novels as the black-white bookish TV, DIVERGENT needs to be praised as the HD version of them all! I am impressed by its diversity and joviality. DIVERGENT is the best novel I've read in 2011, and so far this have been many fantastic books!",MissPageTurner
9780007420414,"My review: I added Divergent to my TBR list almost a year ago, but did not manage to read it in 2011. This is also the reason why this review will be added to my TBR Pile 2012 Challenge. Last year I was really hesitating to pick it up and start reading and there was a simple reason behind it - it was so hyped up and the reviews were so high and praising, so I did have my suspicions that it will be again one of these books... It was not. I know it is important to read the book yourself before getting any opinions about it. This time reviews did not lie about how good Divergent is. Divergent has its flaws as well, but it did not ruin the pleasure of reading it for me. Divergent by Veronica Roth was a refreshing read amongst few other YA Dystopian books I have read. I enjoyed the brilliant world which she has created based on different skills people have and interesting characters were captivating. Divergent is a book which you do not want to put away after you started. It was little slow in the beginning, but the pace is picking up quickly and after that I read until I realized that I just finished the book. The other fact which I was amazed by that the author is quite young herself. It should not surprise me, because lots of talented authors became good writers with their first book, but still. When I started Divergent, I did not do any research about the author prior to reading and after I finished Veronicas' book I was literally amazed. Veronica Roth is definitely talented author and I hope that the next book in series - Insurgent - is as good as Divergent was. Looking very much forward to Insurgent and this time I will not wait until one year after the publishing! Regarding the plot: The reader is introduced into a dystopian world where people are divided into 5 factions - Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite (the intelligent). You meet Beatrice/Tris who is about to choose her faction. She has grown up in Abnegation, but being selfless is not exactly what Beatrice is looking for because she is curious, likes to have her own opinion and she is little more rebellion than other people from her faction. After Beatrice gets 16 she needs to pick a faction. Through the tests she finds out that she is divergent - hence the title of the book -which means that she has parts of all 5 factions hidden in her. Her choice is Dauntless though. To become part of the Dauntless she needs to get her training and pass the tests and this is pretty much what the book is about. Of course there is much more in this book, but the first part in series dealt mostly with becoming a Dauntless. At the same time, Tris finds out that everything is not as it seems, there are big problems and competition about power between the factions and that brings Tris to quite difficult choices: how to hide that she is divergent which is seen as being dangerous; how to remain invisible together with her impressive test results; how to find out what is going on between Erudite and Dauntless faction; how to know whom to trust; how to understand her love interest Four. What I was missing in the story was the background and reason why the humanity was divided into these factions? I personally did not understand that. There were some referrals to the society before the factions were created, but it was far from being enough to understand it. I am hoping that next books will bringer a better understanding of the world. Don't get me wrong - I loved the idea of having these factions and generally I liked the world what Veronica Roth created, but at the very end it did not match up due to lack of the reasoning behind it. While reading the book and after finishing the book, I was trying to relate myself into these factions, I found out that the number of factions was what disturbed me mostly - I think most of the humans have characteristics from all the 5 factions - plus several other non-existing factions. I think that was probably the challenge for the author too, because you never find purely Dauntless or purely Candor or purely any-kind-of-faction people in real world. It intrigued me yet! The other thing which I was missing was the late beginning of story development. Despite the fact that I really enjoyed the book, it took too many pages to come to the point and conflict - the problems between the factions, the war between Abnegation and Dauntless. That was also reason behind me saying that the pace was slow in the beginning. It definitely gave some information about Abnegation and the Dauntless, but I wanted to see that conflict coming earlier in the book. Otherwise, the plot was interesting, filled with action and rarely well written fighting scenes! Besides Divergent being of a dystopian genre, the author really gave a lot of good fighting scenes and action - it blew me away and I loved that! Regarding the characters: Let me start with stating that I liked Tris. Yes, she was sometimes immature, sometimes hollow and annoying but boy, she was suitable to the Dauntless. She was what I like to call kick-ass heroine (excuse the language). She was smart, brave, but there was vulnerable side in her which I liked. When I liked Tris, I loved Four! There were quite many characters I enjoyed when thinking of the supportive characters. I think Peter (who was actually a bad guy in the story) and Eric (even more twisted bad guy) were fascinating! The author did really well with the bad guys. I was also intrigued by Tris' family: her mom being from Abnegation, but was born in Dauntless; her brother choosing the Erudite instead of Abnegation; Four's father - the list would be quite long! The supportive characters gave a lot to this book! It was definitely an added value to the story. Generally: The idea and the world of Divergent were fascinating. It did have its flaws, but it kept me reading and thinking. It had this magic way of drawing me into this book. I will definitely read the next book in the series - Insurgent, but Divergent left me with mixed feelings: in one side I loved it for its originality, but on the other side there were important aspects missing, so I will take the average of 3 and 5 - 4 stars.",Inga Kupp-Silberg
9780007420414,"Ok, to begin with I feel like an idiot for waiting more than a month to read this book. I mean, what have I been thinking? Apparently I wasn't. This book is so amazing! So Tris is a small blonde girl from a faction named Abnegation. People from there have a purpose to be selfless - help other people and forget theirself. But Tris wasn't really a selfless person and she has quite problems with that, in so fitting in. When kids turn 16 they need to choose which faction they want to go. This is a big decision, because they will live there for the rest of their lifes. So Tris needs to decide if leave forever her family or staying in a faction where she thought she didn't belong. That decision transform her forever. Dystopian books are awesome! In the beginning I always find it difficult to understand the setting and the plot of the story. Because it's different from the world we know. Different rules, different values, different maners. So it takes time to understand what the story is about. But when you do, the story becomes great. Divergent is an amazing book. Tris is such a small girl, but she is so so strong. There are so many obstacles she needs to face. She grows up as a character a lot. There is a lot of action in this book and you never know what will happen next. And then there is this boy - Four - which is ohh my gosh! Gorgeous. Strong, fearless, great and also her instructor. The story is so good that you can't put it down and stop reading. You just can't. So I suggest you to take your time when you want to read it, because you won't be able to stop. I needed to stop last night because I was reading on my computer and at 4AM I couldn't see anymore. It was so frustrating. And also insted of studying for my exam, I was reading Divergent :P So if you haven't read this book yet, don't be stupid as I was! Pick it up and start reading it because BELIEVE ME it's worth it!",Nea Barabea
9780007420414,"First of all, let me just wipe my eyes and blow my nose. Goodness knows I need a whole box of Kleenex at this point in time. I have just put down DIVERGENT about 5 minutes ago and I am still sitting here with a tear stained face. *Takes a couple of deep breaths, pulls self together to get on with my review* I usually start with my appreciation of the cover, so that seems as good a place to start as any. It's not pretty in your typical way of 'beautiful woman on the cover' or whatever. Instead it is stunning in the way of 'it caught my attention in the first instance, prompting me to take a closer look'. This cover is bold and impressive. The flames of the symbol are what caught my attention, then upon taking a closer look, I saw people on the landscape below and the skyline of a city. The whole feel of this cover shouts DYSTOPIAN at me. Having only read one book in this genre before, I was unsure what to expect. But I was also intrigued, to see what lay beneath this striking cover. Now for the story itself... Where to begin is the question. Also, how not to give too much away whilst still expressing how I feel about it. The thing is, these are usually questions I ask myself, but this time round it is extra difficult because I don't want to spoil anyone's enjoyment of this book by just babbling on about things that happened. I know some people may read this, having already read DIVERGENT and are just coming to see what I think of it, but I also know there will be those of you that haven't read it yet. So here we go, a hopefully spoiler free review... This Dystopian world is segregated into 5 factions. Each of those factions are dedicated to the upholding of a particular virtue. These are: CANDOR (the honest), ABNEGATION (the selfless), DAUNTLESS (the brave), ERUDITE (the intelligent) and AMITY (peaceful). On an appointed day of the month, all 16 year old must choose a faction to belong to. Their motto is 'Faction Before Blood', so it is not about staying where your family are. It is about making a decision about who you really are. Beatrice Prior is 16 years old and finds herself faced with the choice; stay with her family or be the person she really is. Unfortunately for her, she cannot have both. Initiation for Beatrice's faction is about to begin and when she gets asked her name, she decides to tell the other initiates that her name is Tris. What ensues from here is a constant battle for Tris. She needs to determine who her friends are and whom she can really trust. Also, she needs to figure out how she feels about a sometimes infuriating boy and where if anywhere, a romance would fit into her life. Tris has a secret. A secret that could be explosive. If anyone were to find out, it could spell out her death. There is no-one she can really trust this secret with, so she must keep it to herself. Tris discovers something that she would be better off not knowing. But now that she knows, she can't sit idly by and let the growing conflict tear her faction or indeed any of the other 4 factions apart. Can Tris protect the people she has come to know and care about? Can she do the right thing? Does she even know what the right thing is? These are all questions she finds herself faced with. DIVERGENT was completely gripping and all-consuming from the moment I picked it up. Tris started off as seeming quite meek. Yet throughout the story, she evolves and becomes a force that I would never have seen coming. She transformed in front of my eyes and it was like seeing a child growing up. One day they are just a child, the next they are a woman - brave, strong and true. For me, Tris was one of the most enjoyable heroines I have met. She battled internally with who and what she was, but in the end she came to grips and accepted herself. Throughout every step of this book, I found myself more and more endeared to her. There were times during this story that I laughed. There were times when I get angry with certain characters. There were also times when I felt soppy about the boy she liked. I have to say, I fell totally in love with him myself. It certainly isn't your typical romance, but what they have could be really wonderful. If it weren't for the fact that there is conflict likely to tear Chicago apart. I hope in the next book, INSURGENT we see more of them as a couple, but I know that it will not be without it's ups and downs. I love the way that from the beginning of this book, it was easy to understand without a barrage of information just being thrown at me. It was well set up and I found it easy to get to grips with the ins and outs of the different factions. There are some brilliant characters. There are some awful characters. I will leave it to you to decide which are which. Even the awful characters are brilliantly written though. They leave you with that 'punched in the gut' feeling. All in all, I adored this book. I went into it with the misconception it may be hard to understand but am glad I can say I was wrong. I love Tris. I love Four. I have so much love for this book that it brought me to tears, multiple times. Hence why I needed tissues at the beginning of this review. There are some books that you read and forget. This is not one of those. This book made an impact on me I am not likely to forget. I love Veronica Roth's style of writing and I simply cannot wait until May when I believe INSURGENT is due.",Keren Kiesslinger

9781444722635,"I never intended to read DAUGHTER OF SMOKE AND BONE in the first place. Now I'm so glad Hodder & Stoughton sent me a copy and made me pick this book up. I read it in only a few days and it totally rocked my holidays. ~ It's Magic ~ ""Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic"" The story around protagonist Karou is set in many places. The larger part of DAUGHTER OF SMOKE AND BONE takes place in atmospheric and cultural Prague. But magical portals allow Karou to travel to places all over the world like Paris or Marrakesh. Author Laini Taylor did such a fantastic job describing all the different cities, I could almost feel my feet wandering the Charles bridge in Prague and smell the foreign spices in Marrakesh. It's incredible how many places and worlds we get to discover! ~ Some hot stuff ~ ""Once upon a time, an angel and a devil fell in love. It did not end well."" Now meet Karou, blue-haired heroine extraordinaire. She's a tough and talented young woman who loves to draw and has still so much to discover about her past. I immediately cared about her. Karou's got a talent to draw so vividly you'd think her motifs of humans with animal limbs and heads were real. For Karou they are. Every time she goes through that special door, she'll get to a place called Elsewhere, where her family made up of otherworldly beings lives. And this magical place is just the entrance to a world larger than any human being could imagine. The moment Karou meets stranger Akiva is intense. They have a special relationship, which can be described by so many various feelings, old and new to both of them, and I loved to see how they became more intimate and sure over the course of the story. Akiva is some hot stuff! There are so many other characters introduced to us and every single one of them felt really authentic and alive to me with their unique personalities and histories. Behind the story lies a war that is as ancient as the two races involved themselves. I'd love to gush about the beings Laini Taylor chose to build the story of DAUGHER OF SMOKE AND BONE around, but I don't want to ruin the fun of discovering their secrets and origins yourselves. I knew so little about this book at first and was surprised of how much it had to offer in the end. I enjoyed the journey pretty much. And you won't be disappointed either! ~ The creation ~ ""Happiness. It was the place where passion, with all its dazzle and drumbeat, met something softer: homecoming and safety and pure sunbeam comfort. It was all those things, intertwined with the heat and the thrill, and it was as bright within her as a swallowed star."" Laini Taylor achieved to create a gigantic story background and a wonderful world construct filled with so many colourful characters and places that simply captivate your mind. With each page Laini Taylor reveals a historical background to our character cast that really got to me. It's so beautiful and cruel at the same time. Every single detail fits perfectly and contributes to a wonderful story. Taylor's writing is hyper-engaging. She writes with wit, fun and always seems to find the right amount of words to make a scene lively and relevant. The story is told from a 3rd person narrator and follows Karou and Akiva among others.

9781444722659,"This review might be closer to a... 3.5? However I don't do half ratings so a four it is. Because I'm nice like that. I've been told to read Daughter of Smoke and Bone a lot since it's been released and I've seen a lot of reviews talking about how it's the best thing ever etc etc, however I didn't go into this book thinking that I would feel the same way and approached it the same way I do with every book - a blank slate. I did love it for the most part, particularly at the beginning. It's so refreshing to read a book that isn't set solely in the USA and I've started looking out for those because surprisingly, the USA isn't the only country in the world. Yes, the beginning was awesome. I loved Karou as soon as she made her exes crack itch in a life drawing class and I knew there would be a lot of anger between the two. I loved the vivid descriptions of the city and I really felt like I was there and I really, really loved Karou's backstory and how she grew up. I would be lying if I said I didn't find any faults, however. Kazimir, the jealous ex boyfriend, was used more as a plot device than an actual character. Karou thinks about him often but he only appears in maybe four scenes and doesn't say very much when he's there. I never got a feel for his character or understood why Karou dated him in the first place. The second one almost made me rate this down to 2 stars because I was so irritated. Insta-love. She fights with Akiva when she first meets him, granted, but she falls in love with the guy who's injured her (mild term) and who is supposed to be her enemy so quickly and so passionately that I threw up in my mouth a little. On top of that we get the bs explanation about why they fell in love so quickly that I really didn't appreciate. And then there's being told about how hot Akiva is on pretty much every page in every scene he's in. In one scene her friend goes on and on and on about how much she wants to f*ck him which set my jaw on edge. However, the romance between Madrigal and Akiva really worked for me, even if the Romeo and Juliet tale was obvious. I understood why they were attracted to each other and I was really invested in their story. I would have happily read a longer section about them and their world but I guess that's for another book. The world building was excellent, the characters varied and memorable and Laini's writing flows beautifully. As long as it isn't too heavy on the romance I am looking forward to reading the sequels very much. There's lots of things that I'm hoping will happen in the next book!",Vickie Ramage
9781444722659,"Looking for a wish? Then this book is the exact place to find one. This book was something I has heard a lot of hype about and was itching to get my hands on so it was only natural that I finished it pretty quickly, because once I picked it up I could hardly put it down. Laini Taylor has created a world where mythical beings take a new perspective and keeping your teeth has never been more important. So this book follows the life of Karou who was raised by Brimstone a Chimaera and she collects teeth for him in return for wishes. Things become complicated when the Seraphs learn of Brimstone's existence and before she realises Karou's life is turned upside down and she has to trust the people she is told to run from. But there are other things that Karou doesn't know that change her view of the worlds she lives in forever. I would like to start off my saying that this book was a breath of fresh air because it combined an unusual duo of species that I have never encountered before. Chimaera are beings that have various body parts from several animals. For example, Brimstone has a ram's head and the legs of a lion. On the other hand Seraphim are similar to angels in so far as that they have wings and they are beings of godly creation. The combination of these characters is really unique and because Karou is of a Chimaera perspective it also challenges the views that people have of angels. The protagonist Karou is a well-developed character. She has a love of art and languages and, as well as attending art school, she also happens to be an errand girl. With eccentric blue hair, it is easy to tell from the start that she has a unique personality and I would happily spend some time with her at the Poison Kitchen at 'Pestilence'. She is a dreamer and because of this she is always looking for more from her worlds. She is curious by nature and this leads her into a lot of perilous positions without realising. In contrast we are introduced to Akiva a slightly obsessive, stalker Seraph who becomes infatuated with Karou but doesn't quite know why. The plot thickens significantly when he discovers why she is so important to him and one of my favourite features of the book is the section that introduces us to his past. His character is somewhat dis-likable at the beginning but after this discovery I felt a lot of empathy towards him and genuinely felt sorry for the struggles he faced.",Emma Petfield
9781444722628,"Wow. Where do I start. Well if you haven't noticed the rating already, I absolutely adored this book. I actually had to sit and think for a while before writing the review I was that impressed by it. First off I have to mention the cover. I bought the UK version of the hardback which I have to say looks absolutely stunning and the back has this metallic sheen to it that I adore. Now. The book. How can I even describe it's amazingness?! The imagination that went into this book is breathtaking. There are different characters that are different species (for lack of a better word) to each other. Some of them have wings, some of them have horns and some have hooves for feet. Every time I would read about another character I could imagine what they look like and play what was happening like a film the writing was just that descriptive. The worlds that the book was set in felt like so much thought was put into it, it could actually be real. Reading this book felt like an escape from real life. It was pure brilliance. Let's talk about characters. Karou. Oh my God she was so cool. Akiva - can anyone say hot stuff? Seriously though,they were contrasting characters that had so much depth to them I really wanted to figure them out from top to bottom. I loved reading their story. Brimstone. What can I say? At first I was a bit put off by his personality filled with grunting and stern looks but I loved him after a few chapters. I actually couldn't figure out his intentions until they were revealed at the end which was great. Aaaaaand I won't say anymore than that on Brimstone for fear of spoilers! As for the plot it just exuded brilliance. I've never read anything more original and intriguing. Again I don't want to spoil anything but trust me when I say the plot is by far the best I've ever read in a book so far. Overall I think you can guess that I would recommend this one to anybody who likes to read. It sure is a great use of time and - despite the number of pages - is a really fast read.",Maryam H
9781444722628,"Refreshing and original from page one. I completely enjoyed this book. You know when sometimes you find a book so good you don't care if it's 3am? You just need to keep reading. Well, this one was one of those. Karou is not your average girl. At all. She can't remember her parents, her hair is blue (real blue), she speaks at least 8 languages and her skills for painting are amazing. Oh my, let's not forget the fact that she was raised by chimaeras. Amazingly cool chimaeras who, for some reason, decided to take her in. Do you know what chimaeras are? They are creatures that are part human and part animal. In some cultures they are supposed to be some kind of demons, in others they are simply beings. Since I don't do spoilers you will have to read the book to know who are these creatures. Back to the book: Karou do all sorts of errands for Brimstone, the leader of the chimaera, who collects teeth. Why teeth? He uses them to make necklaces that will grant wishes. Since wishes have different values so does the teeth he uses to create the necklaces. But in one of those errands she runs into an angel who, when he discovers for who she works, tries to kill her but fails because, in the last second, he had to stop. He doesn't know why but he just couldn't kill her. Short after that all the doors that communicate our world with Elsewhere (the chimaeras world) are destroyed stopping Karou from visiting her family who, she is sure, is in great danger. And while trying to discover what went wrong with the doors and finding her family she is about to discover who she is -who she was- and it might be the most difficult thing for her to endure... Maybe Akiva, the angel who tried to kill her, can help her somehow. But sometimes destiny is just pain cruel and sometimes when trying to find answers you just end up stuck in the middle of a war. How convenient, right? Personal opinion: Pick up the book, don't forget a drink, maybe hot chocolate now that winter is coming and sit down with the book. Take a depth breath and let yourself go with the world that Laini Taylor will create for you to see. This amazing author just took the average -and used- fight between angels and demons into another whole level. Karou is clever, strong, independent, fascinating, brave and loyal. The chimaeras are not creatures in her eyes, they are her family, the only thing she has in this world and nothing is going to stop her from finding them. I can't help but admire her. The adventure begins in Prague but get ready to be taken to a lot of different countries, different environments and situations. Karou's life is full of color: friends, places, art, Prague, adventure... every component is a color. Read the book to understand what I'm saying, is difficult to express. This is a love story that will make you heart melt, make you hyperventilate and cry because some things are just too precious to lose. And the title? I couldn't help but smile when I found out the reason of the title. Really, really good!",Alaiel Kreuz
9781444722673,"Through all its beautiful writing, Days of Blood and Starlight broke my heart into a million pieces, put it all together, and then broke it again. And I loved it. Where is Karou? After learning that Akiva was responsible for the genocide of the chimaera and the deaths of her family, Karou made her way through the tear into Eretz. Her friend Zuzanna send email after email of worry, and Akiva searches every place he knows to no avail. As the first book, it's best to go into it without knowing too much, but you can look forward to pee balloons, giant sandcastles, museum thievery, an actual blood bath and some grotesque smiles. The tone is very different to the first book. While Daughter of Smoke and Bone was about magic, wonder and love, this book was about duty, graft, hatred and heartache. Still, everything I loved about the first book was still there, especially the way Taylor balances the epic story with beautiful little character-driven glimpses. Wonderfully, it features a lot of Karou's feisty friend Zuzanna and her lovable boyfriend Mik (possibly the only functional relationship in the whole book) and Akiva's siblings Hazael and Liraz. Taylor also conjures up a whole host of other cool new characters (as a side note to the publishers, I would love to see Karou's notebook brought to life). A definitely standout for me was the wonderful Ziri, someone I'm sure you will fall in love with, because I certainly have. There were so many twists to this story I did not see coming, distracted as I was by the beauty of the lyrical prose. I have never read a book which constantly made my heart ache with each tough decision and impossible circumstance the characters faced. Taylor's writing is truly evocative, and I was amazed by where she took the story in the end. It will be a tough year, waiting for Book 3. This isn't a book you can read as a standalone, so if you haven't yet started Daughter of Smoke and Bone, I urge you to do so. For all those that are already fans of the first book, I can assure you this sequel won't let you down.",Daphne (Winged Reviews)
9780007420124,"This book is a great, simple and good translation of the rules of war that the original author has shared with his followers and the upcoming generations. This man has put so much thought and genius in his warring ways that I am in awe just by reading what he's chosen to share. Current day rules can't even compare to this work. This special edition has the rules, divided as everyone knows them. No additional commentaries. Standing after the guidelines for being a great warmaster is a good linguistic note on the different meanings of some words through the book. It's small and reasonably easy to read, but understanding it would take some more time. At least for me is needs a lot of thought.",Anita N.
9780007368655,I agree--this edition has an extremely small font size. Made for difficult reading but the story is rivetting. Complex characters and well worth the read. So looking forward to seeing the movie coming out in Dec 2012 starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Gatsby.,Maggie Swithenbank

An easy, interesting read that revolves around the great Jay Gatsby and his neighbour (and narrator) Nick Carraway. Read it quickly as I was engrossed in the story line. Look forward to reading it many more times to analyse the characters and their development, as they are complex and engaging. Be warned, this edition has small font!",Channellie

9781409305156,We bought this book when our child was about 8 months old. She loves it and it became quite obvious which parts of the book were her favourite. We usually read/play this book lying down in the bedroom before bed. The pages split horizontally are a pain for us as when lying down you are restricted to ensuring the pages don't hit you and the baby in the face. So you can't join in and feel the different parts and point to different things.,Alyce Quinlan
9781409305156,"This is nice, with lots of clear and bright pictures to point to. The pages are divided into two flaps, which are solid and will not tear. For older kids, there are also some that enable a little counting and comparing ('one big fish', 'three small fish'). But I find that my 18 month old needs a bit more of a story by now, and this doesn't have that.",Julian Hopkins

9781853261589,"I read ""The Little Prince"", 1943 by Antoine De Saint-ExupA?AE?A?©️ry so young, I only recalled the famous cover. I know it is an everlasting classic and expected to enjoy re-learning it. I'm mystified by how engrossed I became from the first sentence. It is positive, rife with bright emotion but all at once engaging, quirky, and clear. It equally manages to make sense for modern day life. Some call this a book of metaphors but I disagree. A writer has influences, a message to impart, and connections can surely be made to other things. That doesn't mean symbols were contrived for readers to guess. This is one novel that is if nothing else, direct: like The Little Prince was portrayed. Friends of mine might woefully find similarities in me, who never speaks rhetorically but seeks a reply! This is a almost a fairytale, urging us to see stars laughing. Instead of probing double-entendres, I accepted the world's parameters as presented: a string of sole-occupant planets with space for a house or a desk. Fiction often incorporates facts and thus a child learns how asteroids are named and that the size of worlds varies greatly. The futility of alcoholism is broached differently from cautionary videos, in a gentle manner that is effective. Because the pilot and prince chat about human basics, everyone gets something out of this; like creativity not being less important than mathematics. The most profoundly struck chord, describes people in my life who discuss finances and training, instead of hopes and what it is that makes you, YOU. Other than the snake portion, turning these pages was an uplifting respite. That Antoine perished in a plane too soon after publication to see his book's effects, is as lamentable as no longer receiving his tender literary and illustrative gifts.",C. Riedel
9781853261589,I was very pleasantly suprised with the quality of the edition (for paperback) and a very favourable price. The most delightful thing about this book are beautiful Antoine de Saint-Exupery's original illustrations that accompany the text.,Ivana
9781853261589,"I loved reading this book as a child and love it even more now as a parent reading it to my child. This is a truly touching, lovely, timeless story. I can not recommend it highly enough. A must for any childs library...and adults too!",Kim Fox
9781853261077,"Reading The railway children was something I've been wanting to do for a while as my auntie always talks so well of the film. I have never watched the film and I wanted to read the book before I did. This book was interesting as it was done from the point of view of the three siblings, which not many classic books are told from the aspect of a child or children. I didn't find the overall story Particularly interesting, but the one thing that kept me going back to finish the book was the big question Why and Where was their Father taken?. There is many adventures in the story that the children get up to involving the railway track and station as well as other areas, and it's great to see how imagination really was a work of art before technology came into place that children use so much nowadays. The story also goes on to show how big life changes affect children and how well children adapt to things, such as moving home and settling into new surroundings and integrating with their new community. Which many adults find especially hard to do. The characters experience great growth during the story as they go through different challenges and assist with crisis and injury as well as building new friendships and creating fond memories. Overall I would say it was a different book to I'm used to reading but that's why I chose to push myself to read it. I would recommend to those who enjoy these sorts of books but personally it wasn't my type of read. I hope this review helps you, please rate it, it really means a lot.

9780416199253,"Taoism concepts, to my own ignorent self, are usually somewhat esoteric, mystical or just generally hard to understand. This book, explaining the major concepts using familiar characters, is very helpful in developing that understanding. While it certainly won't replace the classic texts, it does certainly help to build your understanding by presenting the concepts in an alternative framework. Also, personally, I feel that ""Tao of Pooh"" section was a lot more entertaining/interesting than the Te of Piglet. It's not the defame the latter, it is more that I thought the first book was more fleshed out in its concept. However, both are still compelling, and i'd still recommend reading both instead of just the one.",Iwan Juwono

9781848453371,"Is there no end to this woman's writing talent?!! Julie Kagawa has once again drawn me into one of her stunning worlds where I have been totally and blissfully ensconced for the past few days with intermittent bothersome reappearances into my real world. First I read her Iron Fey series (Amazing) which features Fairies, then I read her Blood of Eden series (Again, Amazing) which features Vampires and now I have just read her first book Talon from her new Talon Saga series which is due out in October 2014 which yes you've guessed it was....Amazing. When I read the synopsis for Talon I thought it sounded really interesting but that there was no way someone can pull off a book with shape shifting Dragons and make me feel any attachment for a mythological creature but I should have known that if anyone could do it, it would have been Mrs Kagawa. I have been absolutely glued to this book and have snuck every spare minute I could muster to read this. If you are a fan of Julie Kagawa books or just a fan of YA, Dragon or Fantasy reads then you will love this book and thank you very much to Harlequin for the ARC. The premise of the series is that Dragons live among us and that they are able to shift into Human form in order to blend in with us. There are two main factions in the book; Talon and the Order of St. George. Talon is the Dragons governance and they are in control of all Dragons in the world (except for rogue Dragons who have broken away from Talon) and are responsible for the safety and placement of all Dragons. Talon will bring a hatchling (baby dragon till they are about 50 years old) up, train them to observe, assimilate and blend in with human society and then ultimately decide as to where within Talon they will continue their training and what role they will play in the future such as become a chameleon and fit in to a high role within the human world. Ember and her brother Dante are teen Dragons who are just about to enter into their training to decide as to what role they will ultimately play within Talon but first their test, and that is to blend into Human life whilst being watched over by their Human guardians. They have just been introduced to their new 'aunt and uncle' and are enjoying their little bit of freedom in southern California, surfing and hanging out with their new Human friends before their training continues after the summer. The Order of St. George is a Human military faction of soldiers who's only goal in life is to rid the world of the Dragon demon wyrms which involves hunting down any possible 'sleeper' Dragons and exterminating them. Garret Xavier Sebastian is one of the Order of St. George's soldiers and he has been given the mission along with his friend and brother in arms Tristan St. Anthony to infiltrate the narrowed down group of suspects in Crescent Beach, find out who the Dragon sleeper is and exterminate them. Garret has been raised within the Order and has been brought up to believe that all Dragons are emotionless, soulless demon wyrms who are fit only for extinction but the green gaze of Ember and her life loving personality soon ensnare him. Could all Dragons be evil or could there be some who are different? Ember likewise has been brought up to believe that all soldiers of the Order are just Dragon murderers with no redeeming qualities so will she discover who Garret really is and if so will her beliefs stand true in the face of her strange Human feelings for him? If the two characters were not enough cue Riley/Cobalt who is a rogue Dragon on the run from both Talon and the Order and claims to know things about Talon that Ember doesn't. Will curiosity get the better of her and why does her Dragon rejoice in his presence?............ Absolutely gripping, page turning story that has left me bereft waiting to read the next book (whenever it may be released) and so I beg please Julie Kagawa and Harlequin, please not too long!",Mrs S Wilson
