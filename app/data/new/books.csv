Haunted by his father's own death at the hands of militants, which he fled just before witnessing, Agu is vulnerable to the dangerous yet paternal nature of his new commander. While the war rages on, Agu becomes increasingly divorced from the life he had known before the conflict started--a life of school friends, church services, and time with his family, still intact. As he vividly recalls these sunnier times, his daily reality continues to spin further downward into inexplicable brutality, primal fear, and loss of selfhood. In a powerful, strikingly original voice, Uzodinma Iweala leads the reader through the random travels, betrayals, and violence that mark Agu's new community.

Forbidden magic runs in her veins. And on the morning of her betrothal ceremony, Shiori loses control.

A sorceress in her own right, Raikama banishes the young princess, turning her brothers into cranes, and warning Shiori that she must speak of it to no one: for with every word that escapes her lips, one of her brothers will die. Penniless, voiceless, and alone, Shiori searches for her brothers, and uncovers a dark conspiracy to seize the throne. Only Shiori can set the kingdom to rights, but to do so she must place her trust in a paper bird, a mercurial dragon, and the very boy she fought so hard not to marry.

The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives. The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable. Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra's family.

As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may-or may not-be her father.

Evil is hiding in plain sight and the only thing more dangerous than fighting demons is falling in love. Cordelia Carstairs is a Shadowhunter, a warrior trained since childhood to battle demons. When her father is accused of a terrible crime, she and her brother travel to Edwardian London in hopes of preventing the family's ruin. Cordelia's mother wants to marry her off, but Cordelia is determined to be a hero rather than a bride. Soon Cordelia encounters childhood friends James and Lucie Herondale and is drawn into their world of glittering ballrooms, secret assignations, and supernatural salons, where vampires and warlocks mingle with mermaids and magicians. All the while, she must hide her secret love for James, who is sworn to marry someone else. But Cordelia's new life is blown apart when a shocking series of demon attacks devastate London. These monsters are nothing like those Shadowhunters have fought before - these demons walk in daylight, strike down the unwary with incurable poison, and seem impossible to kill. London is immediately quarantined. Trapped in the city, Cordelia and her friends discover that their own connection to a dark legacy has gifted them with incredible powers - and force a brutal choice that will reveal the true cruel price of being a hero. show more"

She has a new life in London with her best friend Lucie Herondale and James's charming companions, the Merry Thieves. She is about to be reunited with her beloved father. And she bears the sword Cortana, a legendary hero's blade. But the truth is far grimmer. James and Cordelia's marriage is a lie, arranged to save Cordelia's reputation. James is in love with the mysterious Grace Blackthorn whose brother, Jesse, died years ago in a terrible accident. Cortana burns Cordelia's hand when she touches it, while her father has grown bitter and angry. And a serial murderer is targeting the Shadowhunters of London, killing under cover of darkness, then vanishing without a trace. Together with the Merry Thieves, Cordelia, James and Lucie must follow the trail of the knife-wielding killer through the city's most dangerous streets.

Brin, daughter of Wil Ohmsford, has been born with the magic of the Wishsong, which alone can open a way to the Ildatch. Reluctantly, she joins Allanon on his perilous journey east. Meanwhile her younger brother, Jair, learns that Brin will fail and die unless he can reach her in time. As Brin walks blindly into the trap the Ildatch has set, Jair's only hope of reaching her in time is to travel through the very heart of evil. . .

When different clans ruled - Burners igniting flames, Tiders beckoning waves, and Zelie's Reaper mother summoning forth souls. But everything changed the night magic disappeared. Under the orders of a ruthless king, anyone with powers was targeted and killed, leaving Zelie without a mother and her people without hope.

The face-off won't be straightforward either--the winged beast has a secret that Sif will have to unravel in order to defeat him before the village and its people go up in flames. Sif: Even Dragons Have Their Endings will be followed shortly by the final volume of the Tales of Asgard trilogy, Warriors Three: Godhood's End, also written by Marvel veteran and popular fantasy author Keith R.A. DeCandido. show more"

Lasko-Gross has crafted a coming-of-age story that's weird, cool, and touching."" -- Publisher's Weekly (Starred Review) ""Powerful.... The art style is fantastical and somewhat grotesque, an homage, it seems, to Maurice Sendak. Though the story is far more adult than ""Where the Wild Things Are."" ""Henni"" tells the tale of a young girl, a humanoid cat creature by the title name, as she is oppressed repeatedly by various kinds of religious philistines, all of whom happen to be men. It's a story that champions feminism and advocates a supreme distaste for religious extremism of all kinds.""-- SALON In a fantastical world where old traditions and religion dominate every aspect of life, lives a girl named Henni. Unlike most in her village, Henni questions and wonders what the world is like as she comes of age. Striking out on her own, Henni goes out in search of truth, adventure, and more! Written and drawn my Miss Lasko Gross (A Mess of Everything and Escape From Special), Henni is a commentary on, religion, coming of age, and being yourself. ""One of the most challenging cartoonists working today.... [HENNI is a] significant new work""--BLEEDING COOL ""A classic, clever, smart, timeless adventure story that builds an interesting, scary world with layers of storytelling that will make it a rewarding reading experience for almost anyone. It's like Maurice Sendak making A Handmaid's Tale.""--The VILLAGE VOICE's TOPLESS ROBOT ""Henni is set in a world run by a close-minded religious patriarchy and the titular young girl runs away when she realizes she doesn't want to live the life they've set for her. As she goes off discovering the world, she is bravely indifferent to questioning everything and everyone she comes across, making this kind of a fairy tale for teens... with a strong message about not being afraid to speak up and challenge authority.""--MENTAL FLOSS ""Henni isn't so much a coming of age tale as it is a refutation of our formative years-the time when adults, in their sureness of purpose, attempt to force structure upon those they can overpower. A story about art, feminism, and the paradigm-halting power of imagination in the face of repressive belief-systems, Lasko-Gross's vision teems with the sort of beauty Maurice Sendak might have lent to a children's book written by George Orwell, Virginia Woolf, or Sylvia Plath.""--Samuel Sattin, LEAGUE OF SOMEBODIES show more"

Dayoung Johansson is investigating the Quintum Mechanics megacorporation for crimes against time. As she pieces together the clues, she discovers the ""future"" she calls home - an alternate reality version of 2014 - shouldn't exist at all! Dayoung Johansson is a 15-year-old with attitude-and a jet-pack-wearing cop from the future! When a team of physicists at a corporate research lab switch on their experimental time machine in 1986, Dayoung bursts through the chamber and demands they stop their research. Their discoveries, she claims, set off a domino effect that leads to a future ruled by dirty megacorporation Quintum Mechanics, a future so bleak that she's willing to totally dismantle it. But NYPD cops in 1986 don't take kindly to a punk kid in a jet pack, and Dayoung-affectionally dubbed Rocket Girl after she performs a handful of daring rescues-quickly finds herself on the wrong side of the law. Flashbacks to the future (surprisingly logical) reveal, however, that she may be just a pawn in Quintum Mechanics' decades-spanning power-grab. Reeder does a stellar job of packing the cantilevered panels with bursts of bright, punchy color and clearly depicted, cinematic action, and her characters are refreshingly diverse in race, gender, and body type. Dayoung herself is notably free of the pernicious oversexualization that plagues so many girl superheroes in contemporary comics. With a complex, engaging story and beautiful artwork, this superb throwback series is the perfect fit for teen fans of superhero comics, particularly girls eager for a realistic-looking hero. - Sarah Hunter show more"

She and her best friend/supermodel-in-training Dace long ago mapped out their life plan: Pippa will be the noted fashion photographer, and Dace the cover girl. But ever since last spring, things have changed for Pippa -- and her junior year at Spalding High proves to have its own set of challenges. Not only is Vantage Point, the statewide photography competition, in three short weeks, but her mandatory volunteer placement lands her at St. Christopher's Hospital, a place Pippa never wanted to set foot in again. With humour and pluck, she navigates her new role as a candy striper (watch out for Code Yellows), her changing relationship with her best friend (goodbye Honesty Pact), and -- perhaps most stressful of all -- her new love interests (yes, love interests plural). Will Pippa make it to Vantage Point without having a panic attack? Will either one of the guys prove less sketchy than her last boyfriend? Can she and Dace figure out a way to dream big and be best friends? One thing is certain: real life is a lot more complicated than a photograph. show more"

Amelia Jane gets up to as much mischief as ever, swapping the toys' wind-up keys - so that the clockwork robot is jumping like a rabbit, the motor-car is turning head-over-heels and the mouse is zooming along like a train! Then she hides things inside the poor old bear's tummy, pours water down everyone's clothes! It's all in a day's work for naughty Amelia Jane. But the toys do sometimes manage to get her back - like painting spots on her to make her think she's got the measles, and making a special record to tell her what they really think of her! Short chapters and beautiful illustrations make Amelia Jane perfect bedtime reading for children aged six and upwards. A richly nostalgic offering for grandparents and parents to share with the next generation of Blyton fans. Have you collected all the Amelia Jane titles?

Kerr Dunn highlights how Anna overcame society's expectations of women and survived a life-threatening illness to become a prolific sculptor and an important benefactor of art and wildlife until her death at age ninety-seven. As a young woman, Anna moved to New York City at a time when American women of her class rarely lived alone or worked outside the home. Although she studied briefly under famous sculptors, she soon felt restless and left art school and began to teach herself to sculpt animals by watching them closely, trying to see the animal's true spirit and then representing that spirit in her work. Over time Anna established herself as an important animalier, an artist specializing in realistic portrayals of animals. By 1915 she was one of only ten American women artists earning enough money from the sales of her art to support herself. Later, with her husband, Archer Huntington, Anna founded South Carolina sculpture garden and wildlife preserve Brookgreen Gardens, the country's first public sculpture garden and the world's largest collection of figurative sculpture by American artists in an outdoor setting. This biography provides engaging details of Anna's life, such as her tendency as a child to lie in pastures studying horses; her travels around the country with her husband in a trailer full of monkeys, dogs, and birds; and the couple's purchase of a zoo. In Dreaming with Animals, Dunn has provided us with an affecting portrait of a strong, capable, talented, and innovative woman Robin R. Salmon, vice president for collections and curator of sculpture at Brookgreen Gardens, provides a foreword. show more"

Watchmen begins as a murder-mystery, but soon unfolds into a planet-altering conspiracy. As the resolution comes to a head, the unlikely group of reunited heroes - Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias - have to test the limits of their convictions and ask themselves where the true line is between good and evil. In the mid-eighties, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created Watchmen, changing the course of comics' history and essentially remaking how popular culture perceived the genre. Popularly cited as the point where comics came of age, Watchmen's sophisticated take on superheroes has been universally acclaimed for its psychological depth and realism. Watchmen is collected here in a deluxe hardcover, with sketches, extra bonus material, and a new Introduction by series artist Dave Gibbons. show more"

The first ten lies they tell you in high school. Speak up for yourself--we want to know what you have to say. From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school.

Primary children are now taught number and calculation skills using a range of different methods. This range and variety is most noticeable at Key Stage 2 but the foundations are laid in Key Stage 1. The most obvious difficulties emerge with how to teach multiplication. Most schools are now using a grid method, which should lead through to a vertical format, but many teachers are not clear as to when to make the switch or how to do it. What Number Journey provides is a clear, logical progression with lots of practice at each step along the way. It covers the four rules: addition, subtraction and multiplication and specify particular methods for each one. Most of the materials that are currently on the market are full maths programmes addressing all aspects of maths, including 'using and applying mathematics', or are targeting narrow areas such as mental maths. Number Journey would address strands 2, 3 and 4 of the new Mathematics framework: 'counting and understanding number', 'knowing and using number facts' and 'calculating'. An extremely useful feature of the series is the letters to parents helping schools to explain to parents the approach being used. show more"

A young artist takes a job at a department store in order to make ends meet... little does he know that he may meet his end! In this gothic story for fans of Black Swan, Blankets, and The Devil Wears Prada, can the artist withstand competitive pressure, treachery, and high fashion while still keeping his soul? What do you get when you put an artist in a department store selling nice clothes, all the while wondering why being so clearly in retail hell doesn't stop him from having a modicum of ambition to move up the fashion food chain? Grace (The L'il Depressed Boy) draws upon his experience in retail to craft a graphic novel that gives us a window into the life of an artist who is forced to take a job he doesn't really want in order to pay the bills. What make the story so moving are both the celebration of fashion Grace's character gives us and the introspection of the artist as he looks back on the relationships that have served to define him. While making connections to The Devil Wears Prada is natural, the protagonist's reliance on his partner's understanding and support gets him through the retail ordeal. Grace's attention to form and his skill with visual hyperbole (as in, for example, the saleswoman he depicts as a Skrull) are perfectly suited to the narrative. A sophisticated graphic novel that amply displays Grace's talent for visual storytelling. (Oct.) show more"

Now that Jane has survived her first season on the air, she has learned a few things. Most importantly: Hollywood is full of people trying to use you - especially her former friend and current co-star, Madison Parker. So Jane is trying to surround herself with the people she knows love her for her. Like Scarlett, her best friend since childhood. And Caleb, her high school boyfriend who happens to be back in Los Angeles for the next few months. Sure, after a recent - and very public - love-life implosion, Jane is on a break from boys. But that does not mean she can't spend time with Caleb. They are just friends. She and Braden are also now friends after they lived through a horrible photo scandal. Well, maybe not, but a little drama never hurt anyone... too badly. Full of the ripped-from-real-life plot twists that Lauren's fans love, SUGAR AND SPICE is another great page-turner in this juicy teen series. show more"

Read the book that inspired the Choose Kind movement, a major motion picture, and the critically acclaimed graphic novel White Bird. And don't miss R.J. Palacio's highly anticipated new novel, Pony, available now! I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid--but his new classmates can't get past Auggie's extraordinary face. Beginning from Auggie's point of view and expanding to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others, the perspectives converge to form a portrait of one community's struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel ""a meditation on kindness"" --indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can't blend in when you were born to stand out. show more"

""Segar was the seminal influence in my career,"" the cartoonist said. London updated the strip to reflect current pop culture and also brought back the extended story format favored by Segar. London gives us new yet familiar versions of Popeye, Olive Oyl, Swee' Pea, and Wimpy, as well as Popeye's Pappy, Olive's brother Castor, Eugene the Jeep, Bernice the Whiffle Hen, the menacing Sea Hag, Alice the Goon, and more! Bobby London's take on the Sailor Man has often been overshadowed by his being fired from the strip in 1992, ostensibly for presenting a storyline that was an allegory about abortion. Now, 20 years later, Bobby London fans as well as Popeye fans can rejoice with this first of two volumes that will collect every one of his daily Popeye strips. show more"

But this new Earth isn't the paradise Amy had been hoping for. There are giant pterodactyl-like birds, purple flowers with mind-numbing toxins, and mysterious, unexplained ruins that hold more secrets than their stone walls first let on. The biggest secret of all? Godspeed's former passengers aren't alone on this planet. And if they're going to stay, they'll have to fight. Amy and Elder must race to discover who--or what--else is out there if they are to have any hope of saving their struggling colony and building a future together. They will have to look inward to the very core of what makes them human on this, their most harrowing journey yet. Because if the colony collapses?

And still the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances. The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaesia? And if so, at what cost? Featuring spectacular artwork by cult artist John Jude Palencar, this stunning book brings the bestselling Inheritance cycle to a breathtaking conclusion. show more"

Meanwhile, the squad room becomes co-ed when Lizz permanently joins the cast. Money remains the motivating factor for a new host of crazed villains, including the gymnastic murderesses, the Kitten Sisters; killer con men, the Clipso Brothers; two different spouse slayers; a notorious counterfeiter; and a ""blind"" drug pusher. And, Gould interposes some comedic relief -- the return of bandleader Spike Dyke and the introduction of Morin Plenty (B.O.'s 88-year-old father) and his sugar-addicted wife Blossom -- but humorous interludes are short-lived.

Illustrated by F. Walker and Maurice Greiffenhagen. Unusually for Dickens, Hard Times is set, not in London, but in the imaginary mid-Victorian Northern industrial town of Coketown with its blackened factories, downtrodden workers and polluted environment. This is the soulless domain of the strict utilitarian Thomas Gradgrind and the heartless factory owner Josiah Bounderby. However human joy is not excluded thanks to 'Mr Sleary's Horse-Riding' circus, a gin-soaked and hilarious troupe of open-hearted and affectionate people who act as an antidote to all the drudgery and misery endured by the ordinary citizens of Coketown. Macaulay attacked Hard Times for its 'sullen socialism', but 20th-century critics such as George Bernard Shaw and F.R. Leavis have praised this book in the highest terms, while readers the world over have found inspiration and enjoyment from what is both Dickens' shortest completed novel and also one of his important statements on Victorian society. show more"

Frank Miller calls Pratt one of the true masters of comic art. Long before the term graphic novel entered the popular lexicon - ten years before Will Eisner's A Contract with God - Hugo Pratt pioneered the long-form drawn literature story. Corto Maltese set the standard for all adult adventure comics in Europe. By the mid-1970s, Corto was the continent's most popular series and Hugo Pratt the world's leading graphic novelist. Hugo Pratt's peripatetic sailor was featured in a series of twenty-nine stories. The adventures of this modern Ulysses are set during the first thirty years of the 20th Century in such exotic locales as Pratt's native Venice, the steppes of Manchuria, the Caribbean islands, the Danakil deserts, the Amazon forests, and the waves of the Pacific. EuroComics is working closely with Patrizia Zanotti, Pratt's long-time collaborator, to present the complete Corto Maltese in a series of twelve quality trade paperbacks in Pratt's original oversized B&W format. Corto Maltese: Under the Sign of Capricorn collects the first six inter-connected short stories Pratt created in France in the early 1970s: The Secret of Tristan Bantam, Rendez-vous in Bahia, Sureshot Samba, The Brazilian Eagle, So Much for Gentlemen of Fortune, and The Seagull's Fault. show more"

She also produced a number of captivating stories for youngsters. One of the best, A Dog of Flanders, is presented in this handsome edition -- complete, unabridged, and newly set in large, easy-to-read type with six original black-and-white illustrations by Harriet Golden. First published in 1872, A Dog of Flanders tells the moving story of Nello, a gentle boy with aspirations of becoming a painter, and Patrasche -- his devoted Belgian work dog. The two, along with Nello's grandfather, live in a little village near Antwerp where Nello's idol, the artist Rubens, once worked. Nello and Patrasche suffer countless hardships -- poverty, hunger, cruelty, and rejection. But they persevere in the face of adversity, up to their tragic, bittersweet end. Rich in the sentiment of its Romantic tradition, yet convincing in its portrayal of both human and animal nature, this touching classic has tugged at the heartstrings of readers and listeners alike for generations.

A. Milne, author of Winnie-the-Pooh, in his preface to The Story of Babar. ""And if you have never loved elephants, you will love them now.... After his mother is killed by a hunter, Babar avoids capture by escaping to the city, where he is befriended by the kindly Old Lady. He becomes educated and cultured and, upon his return to the great forest, is crowned King of the Elephants. Jean de Brunhoff's tales of Babar have charmed readers around the world for 80 years. His stories have followed the king of the elephants as he builds a city, founds a family and even meets Father Christmas. Tested by difficult trials - from snakes to fire to runaway prams - he always comes out on top, with the help of patience, determination and, on one memorable occasion, a flight of winged elephants. One of the most iconic series of animal books in history, Babar has become a household name both as a character in children's books and on TV. Beautifully illustrated, this edition is an ideal gift for children aged 3 and up. Also look out for The Babar Collection and Babar the King.

Mark Twain's story of a boy's journey down the Mississippi on a raft conveyed the voice and experience of the American frontier as no other work had done before. When Huck escapes from his drunken, abusive 'Pap' and the 'sivilizing' Widow Douglas with runaway slave Jim, he embarks on a series of adventures that draw him to feuding families and the trickery of the unscrupulous 'Duke' and 'Dauphin'. Beneath the exploits, however, are more serious undercurrents - of slavery, adult control and, above all, of Huck's struggle between his instinctive goodness and the corrupt values of society which threaten his deep and enduring friendship with Jim. Based on the first edition of 1884, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn includes a chronology and list of further reading by Richard Maxwell. Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910) trained as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi river; 'Mark Twain', a phrase used on riverboats to indicate that the water is two fathoms deep, became the pseudonym by which he was best known. After the Civil War, Twain turned to journalism, publishing his first short story in 1865. Dubbed 'the father of American literature' by William Faulkner, Twain led a colourful life of travelling, bankruptcy and great literary success. If you enjoyed The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, you may like Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, also available in Penguin Classics.

A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready? It's the year 2044, and the real world has become an ugly place. We're out of oil. We've wrecked the climate. Famine, poverty, and disease are widespread. Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes this depressing reality by spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual utopia where you can be anything you want to be, where you can live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets. And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade stumbles onto the key to the first puzzle. Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions - and that will leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed. ____________________________________ If you loved READY PLAYER ONE and can't wait for more, check out ARMADA, Ernest Cline's geek masterpiece!

When Autumn Collins finds herself accidentally locked in the library for an entire weekend, she doesn't think things could get any worse. But that's before she realizes that Dax Miller is locked in with her. Autumn doesn't know much about Dax except that he's trouble. Between the rumors about the fight he was in (and that brief stint in juvie that followed it) and his reputation as a loner, he's not exactly the ideal person to be stuck with. Still, she just keeps reminding herself that it is only a matter of time before Jeff, her almost-boyfriend, realizes he left her in the library and comes to rescue her. Only he doesn't come. No one does. Instead it becomes clear that Autumn is going to have to spend the next couple of days living off vending-machine food and making conversation with a boy who clearly wants nothing to do with her. Except there is more to Dax than meets the eye. As he and Autumn at first grudgingly, and then not so grudgingly, open up to each other, Autumn is struck by their surprising connection.

Because one day the three Hollow sisters simply disappeared. And when they came back, one month later, with no memory of where they had been, it was as if nothing had changed. Almost nothing. Apart from, for example, the little scar that had appeared in the hollow of their throats ... and a whispering sense that something is not quite right about them, despite (or maybe because of) the terrible passion to be with them that they can exert on anybody at will...

We were two nights out of Sydney, and there'd been no weather to speak of so far. I was keeping watch on a dark stack of nimbus clouds off to the northwest, but we were leaving it far behind, and it looked to be smooth going all the way back to Lionsgate City. Like riding a cloud. . . . Matt Cruse is a cabin boy on the Aurora, a huge airship that sails hundreds of feet above the ocean, ferrying wealthy passengers from city to city. It is the life Matt's always wanted; convinced he's lighter than air, he imagines himself as buoyant as the hydrium gas that powers his ship. One night he meets a dying balloonist who speaks of beautiful creatures drifting through the skies. It is only after Matt meets the balloonist's granddaughter that he realizes that the man's ravings may, in fact, have been true, and that the creatures are completely real and utterly mysterious. In a swashbuckling adventure reminiscent of Jules Verne and Robert Louis Stevenson, Kenneth Oppel, author of the best-selling Silverwing trilogy, creates an imagined world in which the air is populated by transcontinental voyagers, pirates, and beings never before dreamed of by the humans who sail the skies. show more"

Henry Page has never been in love. He fancies himself a hopeless romantic, but the slo-mo, heart palpitating, can't-eat-can't-sleep kind of love that he's been hoping for just hasn't been in the cards for him--at least not yet. Instead, he's been happy to focus on his grades, on getting into a semi-decent college and finally becoming editor of his school newspaper. Then Grace Town walks into his first period class on the third Tuesday of senior year and he knows everything's about to change. Grace isn't who Henry pictured as his dream girl--she walks with a cane, wears oversized boys' clothes, and rarely seems to shower. But when Grace and Henry are both chosen to edit the school paper, he quickly finds himself falling for her. It's obvious there's something broken about Grace, but it seems to make her even more beautiful to Henry, and he wants nothing more than to help her put the pieces back together again. And yet, this isn't your average story of boy meets girl. Krystal Sutherland's brilliant debut is equal parts wit and heartbreak, a potent reminder of the bittersweet bliss that is first love.

Delisle became one of the few Westerners to be allowed access to the fortress-like country when he was working in animation for a French company. While living in the nation's capital for two months on a work visa, Delisle observed everything he was allowed to see of the culture and lives of the few North Koreans he encountered, bringing a sardonic and skeptical perspective on a place rife with propaganda. As a guide to the country, Delisle is a non-believer with a keen eye for the humor and tragedy of dictatorial whims, expressed in looming architecture and tiny, omnipresent photos of the president. The absurd vagaries of everyday life become fodder for a frustrated animator's musings as boredom and censorship sink in. Delisle himself is the ideal foil for North Korean spin, the grumpy outsider who brought a copy of George Orwell's 1984 with him into the totalitarian nation. Pyongyang is an informative, personal, and accessible look at a dangerous and enigmatic country. show more"

But not everyone. In spellbinding linked narratives, Egan spins out the consequences of Own Your Unconscious through the lives of multiple characters whose paths intersect over several decades. Egan introduces these characters in an astonishing array of styles--from omniscient to first person plural to a duet of voices, an epistolary chapter, and a chapter of tweets. In the world of Egan's spectacular imagination, there are ""counters"" who track and exploit desires and there are ""eluders,"" those who understand the price of taking a bite of the Candy House. Intellectually dazzling and extraordinarily moving, The Candy House is a bold, brilliant imagining of a world that is moments away. With a focus on social media, gaming, and alternate worlds, you can almost experience moving among dimensions in a role-playing game. Egan takes her ""deeply intuitive forays into the darker aspects of our technology-driven, image-saturated culture"" (Vogue) to stunning new heights and delivers a fierce and exhilarating testament to the tenacity and transcendence of human longing for real connection, love, family, privacy and redemption. show more"

Apart from her father being away, and the 'townie' evacuees at school, her life is scarcely touched by the war.

Soon, the whole area is out of bounds, as the Allied forces practise their landings for D-day, preparing to invade France. But Tips, Lily's adored cat, has other ideas - barbed wire and keep-out signs mean nothing to her, nor does the danger of guns and bombs. Frantic to find her, Lily makes friends with two young American soldiers, who promise to help her. But will she ever see her cat again? Lily decides to cross the wire into the danger zone to look for Tips herself...

Cover may vary. Ever since Esther Solar's grandfather was cursed by Death, everyone in her family has been doomed to suffer one great fear in their lifetime. Esther's father is agoraphobic and hasn't left the basement in six years, her twin brother can't be in the dark without a light on, and her mother is terrified of bad luck. The Solars are consumed by their fears and, according to the legend of the curse, destined to die from them. Esther doesn't know what her great fear is yet (nor does she want to), a feat achieved by avoiding pretty much everything. Elevators, small spaces and crowds are all off-limits. So are haircuts, spiders, dolls, mirrors and three dozen other phobias she keeps a record of in her semi-definitive list of worst nightmares. Then Esther is pickpocketed by Jonah Smallwood, an old elementary school classmate. Along with her phone, money and a fruit roll-up she'd been saving, Jonah also steals her list of fears. Despite the theft, Esther and Jonah become friends, and he sets a challenge for them: in an effort to break the curse that has crippled her family, they will meet every Sunday of senior year to work their way through the list, facing one terrifying fear at a time, including one that Esther hadn't counted on: love. show more"

Will take your breath away."" --Kathleen Glasgow, author of Girl in Pieces A stunningly gorgeous and deeply hopeful portrayal of living with mental illness and grief, from an exceptional new voice. Biz knows how to float. She has her people, her posse, her mom and the twins. She has Grace. And she has her dad, who tells her about the little kid she was, and who shouldn't be here but is. So Biz doesn't tell anyone anything. Not about her dark, runaway thoughts, not about kissing Grace or noticing Jasper, the new boy. And she doesn't tell anyone about her dad. Because her dad died when she was seven. And Biz knows how to float, right there on the surface--normal okay regular fine. But after what happens on the beach--first in the ocean, and then in the sand--the tethers that hold Biz steady come undone. Dad disappears and, with him, all comfort. It might be easier, better, sweeter to float all the way away? Or maybe stay a little longer, find her father, bring him back to her. Or maybe--maybe maybe maybe--there's a third way Biz just can't see yet. Debut author Helena Fox tells a story about love and grief, about inter-generational mental illness, and how living with it is both a bridge to someone loved and lost and, also, a chasm. She explores the hard and beautiful places loss can take us, and honors those who hold us tightly when the current wants to tug us out to sea.

Kirkus Reviews From the author of The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender comes a haunting tale of magic and murder. When Rona Blackburn landed on Anathema Island more than a century ago, her otherworldly skills might have benefited friendlier neighbors. Instead, guilt and fear led the island's original eight settlers to burn ""the witch"" out of her home. So Rona invoked the privileges of a witch; she cursed them. But such a spell always comes with a terrible price, and in punishing the island's residents, Rona also bound her family ever tighter to them. Fast-forward to the present day and all Nor Blackburn wants is to live an unremarkable teenage life. And she has reason to hope that she may have escaped the thorny side-effects of the family matriach's curse. But then a mysterious book comes out, promising to cast any spell for the right price. The author - Nor's own mother - seems capable of performing magic that should be far beyond her capabilities. And such magic always requires a sacrifice. A storm is coming.

Billy's just being Billy. He can't be anything else. Can he? 'Phil Earle writes starkly but sensitively about damaged children in this brilliant page-turning novel. It moved me to tears' - Jacqueline Wilson 'Being Billy was a total page-turner - authentic and gritty. Billy's voice doesn't falter . . . spiky, brave and compassionate' - Jenny Downham, author of Before I Die 'Moving and powerful, I loved it' - Sophie McKenzie Phil Earle was born, raised and schooled in Hull. His first job was as a care worker in a children's home, an experience that influenced the ideas behind Being Billy. He then trained as a drama therapist and worked in a therapeutic community in south London, caring for traumatized and abused adolescents. After a couple of years in the care sector, Phil chose the more sedate lifestyle of a bookseller, and now works in children's publishing. Phil lives in south-east London with his wife and children, but Hull will always be home. show more"

The beginning of winter is marked by the solstice, the shortest day of the year. Long ago, people grew afraid when each day had fewer hours of sunshine than the day before. Over time, they realized that one day each year the sun started moving toward them again. In lyrical prose and cozy illustrations, this book explains what the winter solstice is and how it has been observed by various cultures throughout history. Many contemporary holiday traditions were borrowed from ancient solstice celebrations. Using clear, concise language, Pfeffer discusses important ideas behind the shortest day of the year, such as the change from autumn to winter as well as the concept of the Earth's tilting away from the sun.... While appealing to a younger audience, this treatment combines the cultural approach of Ellen Jackson's The Winter Solstice (Millbrook, 1994) and the activities of Sandra Markle's Exploring Winter (Atheneum, 1984; o.p.). Pfeffer uses an easy, comfortable tone for conveying the basic information, and the end pages will provide additional opportunities for would-be astronomers to explore the principles on their own. --School Library Journal Simple science activities, ideas for celebrating the day in school and at home, and a further-reading list are included. show more"

For Lady Gaga, kindness is the driving force behind everything she says and does. The quiet power of kindness can change the way we view one another, our communities, and even ourselves. She embodies this mission, and through her work, brings more kindness into our world every single day. Lady Gaga has always believed in the importance of being yourself, being kind to yourself and others, no matter who they are or where they come from. With that sentiment in mind, she and her mother, Cynthia Germanotta, founded Born This Way Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making the world a kinder and braver place. Through the years, they've collected stories of kindness, bravery, and resilience from young people all over the world, proving that kindness truly is the universal language. And now, we invite you to read these stories and follow along as each and every young author finds their voice, just as Lady Gaga has found hers. Within these pages, you'll meet young changemakers who found their inner strength, who prevailed in the face of bullies, who started their own social movements, who decided to break through the mental health stigma and share how they felt, who created safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth, and who have embraced kindness with every fiber of their being by helping others without the expectation of anything in return. Individually and collectively, the stories collected here prove that kindness not only saves lives but builds community. Kindness is inclusion, it is pride, it is empathy, it is compassion, it is self-respect and it is the guiding light to love. Kindness is always transformational, and its never-ending ripples result in even more kind acts that can change our lives, our communities, and our world. show more"

A child growing up knowing they have a right to their own personal space, gives that child ownership and choices as to what happens to them and to their body. It is equally important a child understands, from a very young age, they need to respect another person's body boundary and ask for their consent when entering their personal space. This book explores these concepts with children in a child-friendly and easily-understood manner, providing familiar scenarios for children to engage with and discuss. It is important that the reader and the child take the time required to unpack each scenario and explore what they mean both to the character in the book, who may not be respecting someone's body boundary, and to the character who is being disrespected. It is through these vital discussions that children will learn the meaning of body boundaries, consent and respect. Learning these key social skills through such stories as 'Let's Talk About Body Boundaries, Consent and Respect' and role-modelling by significant adults can, importantly, carry forward into a child's teenage years and adult life. show more"

Janusz Korczak was more than a good doctor. He was a hero. The Dr. Spock of his day, he established orphanages run on his principle of honoring children and shared his ideas with the public in books and on the radio. He famously said that children are not the people of tomorrow, but people today. Korczak was a man ahead of his time, whose work ultimately became the basis for the U.N. Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Korczak was also a Polish Jew on the eve of World War II. He turned down multiple opportunities for escape, standing by the children in his orphanage as they became confined to the Warsaw Ghetto. Dressing them in their Sabbath finest, he led their march to the trains and ultimately perished with his children in Treblinka. But this book is much more than a biography. In it, renowned nonfiction master Albert Marrin examines not just Janusz Korczak's life but his ideology of children: that children are valuable in and of themselves, as individuals. He contrasts this with Adolf Hitler's life and his ideology of children: that children are nothing more than tools of the state. And throughout, Marrin draws readers into the Warsaw Ghetto. What it was like. How it was run. How Jews within and Poles without responded. Who worked to save lives and who tried to enrich themselves on other people's suffering. And how one man came to represent the conscience and the soul of humanity. Filled with black-and-white photographs, this is an unforgettable portrait of a man whose compassion in even the darkest hours reminds us what is possible. show more"

This book can be read to children from 3 to 9 years. It is a springboard for discussions regarding children's choices and their rights. The 'Note to the Reader' at the beginning of the book and the 'Discussion Questions' on the final pages, guide and enhance this essential discussion. It is crucial that our children, from a very young age, are taught to have a clear, strong voice in regards to their rights - especially about their bodies. In this way, they will have the confidence to speak up when they are unhappy or feel uncomfortable in any situation. A strong, confident voice as a young child converts to a strong, confident pre-teen, teenager and adult. With the prevalence today of online and offline bullying and various forms of abuse, such as physical, emotional and sexual abuse; our young people need to learn (from a young age) to always speak up when their rights are not being respected. The aim of this book is to empower young children and to give them a voice so they can grow up into empowered adults. When a child, teenager or adult says, 'No!' to any form of coercion, this should be immediately respected. A world where 'No!' does actually mean 'No!' can be a world with far less violence and increased respect for humankind. By educating our children to have true respect for one another, this world can be a much safer and more positive place. Body Safety Education (aka sexual abuse prevention education) empowers girls and boys through knowledge, and teaches them they have the right to say, 'No' and to respect other's personal boundaries. Both girls and boys need to learn to ask for consent and this can be taught from a very young age. Some of the scenarios in this book are typical of approaches used by sexual abusers (sexual predators/molesters/pedophiles) when grooming children for sexual abuse. Their aim is to desensitize the child to having their personal space violated and desensitize them to touch.

Yet the truth about pirate women--who they were, why they went to sea, and what their lives were really like--is seldom a part of the conversation. In this Seven Seas history of the world's female buccaneers, A Pirate's Life for She tells the story of 16 women who through the ages who sailed alongside--and sometimes in command of--their male counterparts. These women came from all walks of life but had one thing in common: a desire for freedom. History has largely ignored these female swashbucklers, until now. Here are their stories, from ancient Norse princess Alfhild to Sayyida al-Hurra of the Barbary corsairs; from Grace O'Malley, who terrorized shipping operations around the British Isles during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I; to Cheng I Sao, who commanded a fleet of 1,400 ships off China in the early 19th century. Author Laura Sook Duncombe takes an honest look at these women, acknowledging that they are not easy heroines: they are lawbreakers. A Pirate's Life for She tells their full stories, focusing on the reasons they became pirates. It is possible to admire the courage, determination, and skills these women possessed without endorsing her actions. These are the remarkable stories of women who took control of their own destinies in a world where the odds were against them, empowering young women to reach for their own dreams. show more"

It's a who's who of the baddest of the bad, from those paradigms of literary terror, Dracula and Frankenstein; to the creatures of myth, both Western - like Polyphemus, the human-devouring one-eyed Cyclops of Homer - and not, like the Japanese Goblin-Spider; to witches, werewolves, golems, spirits, and scary human anomalies including the Headless Horseman, Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, and Rappaccini's daughter, the poisonous maiden of Padua. Every monster is brought to life first in a full-size, full-colour portrait that captures the essence of the beast, and in lively text that recounts the story, highlights the gruesome details, and rates each monster on the Scare-o-Meter. Sidebars explore the source texts, giving readers a geniunely exciting introduction to literary genres and history, and making this book especially valuable for reluctant readers. show more"

Thus begins the saga of Vikramaditya, the brave and noble king, and the Vetal, his tormentor from the spirit world. As Vikramaditya trudges through the forest, the Vetal narrates stories to him, ending each with a riddle that tests the king's famed sense of justice, his ideas of right and wrong. Many centuries later, a twelve-year-old girl, disgusted at the way her summer holiday is turning out, runs away to a dusty field where she meets a strange old man sitting under a large tree. The man tells her stories about kings and queens and people of long ago, tales of generosity, courage and wisdom as well as of treachery, deceit and great stupidity. Incredibly, each of the stories deals with ideas and issues that are being debated at home by her eccentric grandmother. She also learns that these are the ancient Vikram and Vetal stories, and that King Vikramaditya had asked for a boon wanting these tales to be handed down generations. But who is the old man? And what connects the girl to a king from ancient times?

Alexander Nevsky is a central figure in Russian history, having lived during one of Russia''s darkest periods -- the invasion of the Teutonic Knights. Alexander Nevsky helped establish the Russian nation by defeating the Teutonic Knights, invaders from the last vestiges of the Holy Roman Empire, with an army comprised of ordinary citizens who were poorly-equipped soldiers, but fought for their freedom. This ragtag band, against overwhelming odds, defeated the invaders in an epic battle on the frozen lake Peipus -- a spectacular achievement that is still celebrated in Russia to this day. In 1938, the great Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, much acclaimed for his masterful historical interpretations, as seen in Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944), brought the story of Alexander Nevsky to life on the silver screen in an innovative and brilliant way, by developing new film techniques that remain in use almost 100 years later by some of the greatest directors of our time.

It has been feared, worshipped, admired, hunted, studied, photographed, written about, immortalized in art and poetry and has enthralled king and commoner alike. Tiger Fire celebrates this magnificent predator by bringing together the very best non-fiction writing, photography and art on the Indian tiger from the first written description of a real-life encounter with the animal by the Mughal Emperor Babur in the sixteenth century to photographs and studies of the last of the species surviving in the wild today.Conceived and edited by the world's foremost authority on the Indian tiger, Valmik Thapar (who has also contributed many pieces and photographs to this volume), the book's contributors are drawn from an array of renowned naturalists, writers, photographers and tiger enthusiasts down the centuries including Babur, Akbar, Francois Bernier, Thomas Roe, R.G. Burton, Walter Campbell, Thomas Williamson, F.W. Champion, Kesri Singh, Jim Corbett, Hugh Allen, Richard Perry, Arjan Singh, George Schaller, Kenneth Anderson, M. Krishnan, Peter Jackson, Fateh Singh Rathore, Kim Sullivan, Tejbir Singh, Jaisal and Anjali Singh, Aditya 'Dicky' Singh, K. Ullas Karanth, Dharmendra Khandal and Dhritiman Mukherjee. Culled from over a million words (both published and unpublished) on the animal and several thousand photographs, the accounts and pictures assembled in this book show us the tiger in extraordinary and compelling detail. The book contains stories and reports of tiger hunts, attacks on humans by tigers, fights between the tiger and other animals such as the leopard, the bison, the wild dog, the boar and the elephant, narratives about tigers rearing their young, finding mates and wild tigers forging bonds with humans. Using his unequalled knowledge of wild tigers, derived from almost forty years of observing them in their natural habitat, Valmik Thapar has put together the most ambitious book ever published on the tiger in India. A lasting testimonial to an animal that has dazzled the human race, Tiger Fire will be treasured by everyone who possesses it. show more"

Stories of pogroms seeped through the countryside, and the czar was conscripting soldiers because of rumors of war and revolution. Benjamin Balaban, a poor but very devout Jew, determines to flee to America. He will take Raizel, his almost-twelve-year-old daughter, and once they are settled he will send for his wife and other children. Raizel doesn't understand the reasons for leaving. How can her village be dangerous? It's full of magic and the stories and poems that her grandmother Bubba tells her. But go she must. Her odyssey with her father across Russia and Europe and on to America is full of adventure, adversity, and hardship. She desperately misses her family, but she retells Bubba's stories to keep her memories alive. Finally, they board a ship for America, but a terrible storm makes Raizel and her father sick. All their food is stolen, and Benjamin won't eat non-kosher food. At Ellis Island, his long beard and ear locks, his peasant clothes, his deep cough, and emaciated frame get them turned away from America. Raizel, though, is now determined to get back to America and the hope of a new life for her whole family. She must convince her father that he'll have to give up his orthodox food and traditions and put on the clothes of his new country. She and her father both will have to leave everything behind to make their final crossing to America.

Baby's First Signs and More Baby's First Signs are two illustrated books designed to provide your infant with the means to articulate his or her fundamental desires. Baby's First Signs and More Baby's First Signs are durable board books, lavishly colored in bright reds, blues, greens, and yellows sure to please your child's eye. Each page features an illustration of a toddler signing a word as well as demonstrating what the sign is about. For example, on the ""baby"" page, the toddler makes the sign for ""baby"" by mimicking the cradling of a child in his arms while also smiling at his baby sister sitting beside him. The illustrations include both a diagram box that depicts exactly how to perform the sign and the English word in the top left corner, so that your child will learn English and sign language simultaneously. The books cover fundamental expressions such as ""sleep,"" ""cold,"" ""eat,"" ""hurt,"" ""rain,"" ""daddy,"" and ""car."" ""Signing is a beautifully tactile way for babies to learn about their world,"" the authors write. ""It acknowledges a baby's natural abilities and provides a powerful tool for self-expression.""

But the Legend of Parzival is more than the tale of one knight's epic journey to find the elusive Holy Grail; along the way Parzival faces a challenging journey of self-discovery. He must conquer his ignorance and pride, and learn humility and compassion before he is finally worthy of becoming a Grail Knight. This accessible prose retelling of the medieval German epic brings the wonderful story of the Arthurian knight (known variously as Parzival, Parsifal and Percival) to life for today's readers, while faithfully preserving the story, characters and tone of Wolfram von Eschenbach's thirteenth century narrative poem. In Steiner-Waldorf education, Parzival's quest is seen as a metaphor for the difficult journey through life, which speaks strongly to the adolescent, and its study is at the heart of the Class 11 curriculum. As a hugely experienced Steiner-Waldorf teacher, Robin Cook's engaging retelling will provide valuable inspiration for other teachers and students, as well as enjoyment and enrichment for all readers. show more"

It contains fourteen short stories based on strange events. Some highlights of the book are storiesby members ofAssociation of Writers and Illustrators for Children(Indian section ofIBBY) and artby well-known children's illustratorTaposhi Ghoshal The stories relate happenings that are unexpected and inexplicable, making a child wonder how and why those events must have happened. The enjoyment of the stories lies in the sense of wonder that they create. For instance, a boy falls into a ravine and discovers something unexpected, or a house comes alive in a strange way . . . The stories are based on ghosts and other worldly manifestations. The ghosts, however, are all friendly who seem to want to take care of children and people in trouble. There is no hint of malevolence or spite. In fact, one feels connected to people in history through their appearance as spirits in present times. The stories are thus a positive way of enjoying the imaginary world of spirits. It is well known that children these days read a lot of fantasy in which humans have to battle against other worldly forces. It is clear that there is a natural desire in them to imagine worlds that are different from the ordinary, everyday world in which they live. This need should be addressed through stories that stimulate the imagination in a positive way and not create worlds that are filled with violent and gory events. The stories in this collection recall the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, in that our everyday world is shown to contain many a curious tale. The fourteen stories in this collection have been written by well-known writers for children in India, such as Ramendra Kumar, Somya Dave, Nita Berry, Nilima Sinha, Dipavali Sen, Thangamani, Jaya Paramasivan, Devika Rangachari, Girija Rani Asthana, Ira Saxena, Neera Jain, Deepa Agarwal, Surekha Panandiker, and Swapna Dutta. The Stranger and Other Curious Stories begins with The Stranger by Ramendra Kumar. It narrates the story of a writer researching for his second novel - a ghost story set in the British colonial era. As he gets lost in the Devdar Woods of Landour, a picturesque town nestling in the hills above Mussourie, he encounters two ghosts. A chilling yet emotional story, wherein one of the ghosts tells the writer the story of his friend's death, and how he sacrificed his own life trying to save his friend. Some of the other curious stories include Nita Berry's Another Time, where two young girls on a field trip with their class to Chittor get a 'forbidden glimpse through the veils of time'. As they are magically transported back in time, they witness the jauhar of the Rajput queen, Rani Padmini. This extraordinary tale is followed by Nilima Sinha's Always with You, which shows the beautiful and endearing relationship between a boy and his grandfather. True to his promise that he would always stay with his grandson 'in spirit, if not in body', the grandfather, after his death, protects the young boy in the form of a benevolent and loving spirit, saving his life from a fatal accident. show more"

This book was written specifically for middle school performers -- about topics they can relate to in a language style they understand. A wide variety of topics to fit any student's personality allows young actors to choose from either humorous or dramatic selections.

These monologues, duologues, and triologues may be used for auditions, classroom assignments, or discussion starters. Many of the monologues are adaptable for guys or girls, making this book even more valuable as a resource! show more"

The six books use simple words that the early reader will easily grasp. They have been carefully chosen by a reading specialist to help students advance from the short vowels to the silent ""e"" to the vowel combinations. At the back of each book is a list of sight words that should be reviewed with the child before reading the book.

A Black Witch is set to turn the human world into a slavery of coldness if she finds her way in. Her accomplice, an elusive goblin, is trying to capture four children, and if these children surround the Old Oak Tree only darkness will prevail for eternity. But who is he? Angus Moon, a charming Scottish boy, is bewildering and no one seems to understand his role. Alyssa too seems a rather knowledgeable dark horse. And Myriad, the elf? Well, he's just ridiculously tiny. A new headmaster, Mr Vixonight, is acting suspicious. Miss Terrine? She just smells of old coffee. And Miss Lovett? Too bothersome she is. At the crux of Anouka, will the light or the dark side prevail? Will Mr Vixonight be able to hide his true colours? Will Angus Moon ever stop flirting. And Alyssa? Will her heroine nature help or hinder? William and Rosabella could get slain alongside their friends, or will Mrs Joy be able to rely on her son to get back home unscathed, with at least a semi-pleasing school report? For once. show more"

It was penned under the guidance of noted theatre personality Feisal Alkazi, who subsequently directed four successful performances of the play by his theatre group. This lively and humorous play is suitable for the middle school stage. Its theme of the immortality of books is greatly relevant, especially in times of distracting and addictive social media. The play brings together some of the most memorable and lovable characters from literature and media - the clever and sreet smart Aladdin who lives on his wits; Long John Silver from Treasure Island singing his trademark 'Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum'; the cackling witch from Hansel and Gretel who evokes fear in children; and the endearing pair of the bandar (monkey) and the magarmach (crocodile) from the Indian classic Panchatantra. These characters come face-to-face with P L Travers' Mary Poppins, the perennial friendly, singing nanny, who always carry an umbrella and a carpetbag; Satyajit Ray's creation, the detective Feluda; the 'Off with their heads' Queen of Hearts and the scared White Rabbit of Alice in Wonderland; and finally the robot R2D2 from Star Wars. As they travel together with the protagonist, a young girl, in search of the Magic Castle, they face many challenges. Disunity and greed break the travellers into two groups, with the rebellion led by Long John Silver. Although the group reunite, they face new hurdles. First, they meet Rangeela Raja and Rangeen Rani, symbolic of the distraction offered by the glamorous world of cinema and television, which threaten the habit of book reading. In spite of every difficulty, the Girl and her storybook friends march on. The characters fall into the Pit of Oblivion, symbolic of their erasure from our memory and our lives. On the girl's earnest request, Rangeen Raja jumps in the pit to save them. Soon after, they are attacked by Termites, which later transform into Computer Viruses, but are destroyed by the eponymous hero of the Prince of Persia video game. Finally, as they reach their destination, they realize that the Magic Castle is actually a library, a haven for books. The girl is awarded a lifetime membership of the library and a magic Gold Card that will transport her to the library any time she wishes, for escorting all the characters to their destination safely and thus giving them the treasure of immortality. The unique and symbolic play is a reminder of the importance of books in our lives and what we may do to preserve them. The journey of the girl and the fictional characters towards immortality and perennial readership is a metaphor of this need to keep books alive. show more"

Upon completion, the student will be more competent in 6th grade mathematics and ready to proceed with more difficult exercises. Unlike other math drill books, this is one of 24 workbooks created to establish a daily routine for each student to practice on their own from grades 1 through 7. It is specifically designed to gradually increase mathematic ability with the least amount of stress for both parent and student. Kids need to practice at home to support what they are learning in school, but finding resources to help with that goal can be daunting. It takes a lot of time searching online for free resources to print or for books with enough exercises. Beyond that, the options include going to libraries, enrolling them in an afterschool class or hiring a personal tutor. Who has the time and money for all of that? The answer is, not many parents. Each and every parent wants to provide enough practice work to their kids, but on top of the challenges in finding resources, questions remain about how much practice a child needs to boost educational success: twenty sheets of practice work a day? One sheet a week? What's the optimum practice work during a whole academic year? Confused? The authors have a decade of classroom expertise and have spent a large amount of time researching and wasting resources trying all the options for their own kids. Now you can benefit from what they have learnt. The result is finding out that ""ONE-SHEET-A-DAY"" is the optimum way to support classroom learning, and it is amazingly simple. This book eliminates the need to take home prints or run around franchises, bookstores and libraries trying to find enough material. It also prevents you from overwhelming your kids with too many math drill worksheets. There are approximately 200 school days a year. Simply have your child complete ONE per day. Work is far easier when it is part of a routine, especially for kids. The One-Sheet-per-Day program is an easy routine to start and maintain because it takes less than 20 minutes per day, using basic skills your child already knows. Simply take one sheet from the book, ask your child to complete it in a quiet place, and return it to you to check the answers, a painless routine for you and your child, and instant feedback for both of you. Geared to follow most math curriculums, most kids can do the appropriate sheet on their own based on what they are learning at school.

It contains 200 math practice sheets, one for each school day of the year. Upon completion, the student will be more competent in 6th grade mathematics and ready to proceed with more difficult exercises. Unlike other math drill books, this is one of 24 workbooks created to establish a daily routine for each student to practice on their own from grades 1 through 7. It is specifically designed to gradually increase mathematic ability with the least amount of stress for both parent and student. Kids need to practice at home to support what they are learning in school, but finding resources to help with that goal can be daunting. It takes a lot of time searching online for free resources to print or for books with enough exercises. Beyond that, the options include going to libraries, enrolling them in an afterschool class or hiring a personal tutor. Who has the time and money for all of that? The answer is, not many parents. Each and every parent wants to provide enough practice work to their kids, but on top of the challenges in finding resources, questions remain about how much practice a child needs to boost educational success: twenty sheets of practice work a day?

Though painfully aware of the dire political climate of the time, they work hard to instill their children with wholesome American values rather than crippling existential fears. Lenny, oldest of the five children, succeeds at school, plays alley ball with his friends and siblings, and occasionally listens to the radio or his father's conversations, which all seem to center around the events in Europe. Life is good. That is, until the neighborhood bully, Louis, comes along. A neglected child doomed to inherit the violent, racist ways of his alcoholic father, Louis increasingly antagonizes Lenny, culminating in a foolhardy dare to see which of them is brave enough to enter the Prescotts' allegedly haunted mansion. Lenny accepts Louis's challenge not out of spite or a desire to be seen as brave, but out of a need to prove to the world what he already knows to be true: that Louis, like all bullies, tyrants, and war-mongering dictators, is a coward. The only hope for liberation lies in direct confrontation, not appeasement. Can Lenny keep the evil at home at bay while the forces of evil are gathering abroad? Lenny's Dare: A Novel of Youth in a Time of War captures the essential incongruity of pre-WWII American life -- a world where children at home grew, played, and went to school while great forces abroad gathered like clouds portending the deadliest storm the world had ever seen. show more"

Then, everything changed when he discovered a rash of car thefts plaguing his neighborhood. His friends wrangle him into a weeklong caper of trying to discover the car thieves while keeping up with school, hiding out from bullies, finishing his paper route, and maybe, just maybe getting noticed by Jasmine Torrence.

One day, he is captured suspected of being a spy. They march him back to camp and present the boy to Leonidas. Once the king is satisfied the boy is freeborn and not an escaped slave, he summons his companions to pass judgment upon him. Strict obedience is a virtue among the Spartans, and breaking rules is severely punished. When the Spartan warriors hear of the boy's resolve to join them to fight the Persians, they approve of his high spirits. Leonidas proclaims the lenient punishment of a single lash, to remind him that a Spartan never turns his back in battle. One man steps forward to deliver the punishment. It is the one man Agis has come to see, yet the one man he dreads being disgraced before: his father. His father, Nikandros, delivers the lashing. Leonidas, guessing their relationship, tells Nikandros to take the boy back to his companions and look after him. They encounter another troop of warriors from the town of Thespiae, also on route to Thermopylae. Leonidas welcomes them, but points out that the Thespian hoplites all make their living as farmers, stone-carvers, weavers and the like, yet every one of the Spartans is trained to be a warrior. Leonidas declares that his troops will take on the brunt of the fighting, and will keep the other Greeks in reserve. They reach the Hot Gates, a narrow pass between the mountains and the cliffs overlooking the waters of the gulf. It is a ""choke points"" of Greece, a narrow passage around the mountains that anyone traveling south must pass through. The Persian forces will have to pass here, and here the Greeks will make their stand. The name of the pass is due to the hot springs that flow there. They find the remnants of a wall, and they work to rebuild it. Soon, scouts approach the pass, looking what resistance they will find. Leonidas banters with them. Although his father wants him safely away from the battle, Leonidas places Agis in a protected lookout to watch the road ahead and give warning. For two days the Spartans hold the pass. The Persian king throws his personal elite forces, the Immortals, against them, but to no avail. Then word comes that the Greeks have been betrayed. A traitor has revealed a goat path over the mountain and the Persians are already crossing to attack the Greeks from behind. Leonidas sends all the Greek reserves away, but the Spartans remain. He orders Agis to lead a blinded hoplite back to Sparta. They are to report that those who remained have been true to the common law of Sparta, never to retreat from battle. With a heavy heart, Agis obeys this last order from his king, departs from his father, and leads the wounded hoplite back to Sparta. show more"

Three years after being unjustly excluded from medical school, he tried again, by undertaking a science degree to regain his place.

It could be argued that organised crime - and the networks that supply controlled drugs specifically - are targeting people from the age of 13 and upwards in a way that previous generations never had to become aware of. While children and young people have always been victimised by criminal gangs the threat of County Lines makes this danger key to a vast empire of coordinated criminal profiteering. It is brutal. More than ever, a billion pound sterling black market venture is now built upon the exploitation of children. The question is - how many young people know about this? What do you know about this? If you or a friend are being drawn into the web of criminal exploitation, do you know what to do about it? How do you begin to protect yourself? This book is written out of respect for the fact that young people are capable of learning how to deal with this threat. From streetwise kids who have to fend for themselves, to financially well supported, but otherwise isolated young people. This particular form of risk shows no prejudice. It is something that could afflict anyone. Reading this book will give you the information you need to recognise County Lines when you see it. You will see it from a distance and you'll be able to avoid it. If you or a friend have been ensnared - this book will help you to take the first steps towards getting your life (or their life) back together. If you wake up in anxiety - worried that your life is getting out of control, if you feel that you are being drawn into circles of drug abuse and dependency, if you feel threatened, coerced, bullied, stalked or harassed: this book will offer you options that you can think about, and methods that you can turn to. You might feel trapped - but there is an escape. Written in a friendly and non-judgemental tone - free from the prejudice of victim blaming - this book will give any young person a refreshing opportunity to take stock of their own life and draw their own conclusions. The language is modern, accessible, and deliberately avoids patronising the reader by using an adult to adult approach and dialogue. The cover of the book is deliberately bland and doesn't seek attention. You can read this book discreetly - and quite unlike reading on the internet (where we all leave foot-prints) nobody ever needs to know that you ventured into it - unless and until you make the decision to talk to someone. County Lines - A Young Person's Guide is a book that is intended for you. It is written with the reader in mind throughout. Whether you are simply worried about this topic, or if you fear that you are already in too deep - reading this book is about the journey towards safety and peace of mind. show more"
