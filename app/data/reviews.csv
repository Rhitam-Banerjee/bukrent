9781416947370,My son (10 months) loves lifting the flaps on this book. The flaps are made from a heavy material and so far has lasted well (unlike some other board books where they have been easily torn from the page).,Pauline Banh
9781416947370,"My 18 month old loves this book! It's a simple story of various animals the zoo sends the writer to have as a pet. My daughter now knows which animal is under each flap and loves to call out it's name (e.g. ""monkey!"") on each page. This is a great book, especially for children 1-3 years old.",Natalie PageWeir

He loves lifting the flaps to see the animals so it's not just me reading the book to him, he's actively engaging too!

9781416947370,"This book is great Only down side is there are no names for the animals, so could be more difficult for English 2nd language. However is great as you can add your own words, as my husband likes to ...""so they sent me an... elephant from Thailand"" etc.",Anne-Maree

9780241003008,"""A favourite in our house. My daughter is transfixed from the 'teeny-tiny-shiny-egg' until the 'beauuuutiful butterfly' at the end. She enjoys 'helping' with the story, and in fact, while she can't read yet, pretty well knows it word for word we have read it so much. Highly recommend this book!""",a Book Depository customer

9781841215655,Both my kids (18 months and 3 months) really enjoy being read this book. My eldest loves pointing out the different animals and my 3 month old seems to enjoy the colourful illustrations. My kids may be too young to understand and appreciate the message of the book but I know they will when they get a bit older. Recommended.,Merryn
9781841215655,"Giraffes Can't Dance engages kids with the rithmic text and colorful illustrations. It is a great book for kids to pick up rhyming words and have some fun making up their own words. The story of Gerald has good moral to it of not to judge others and finding your own individuality. Giles Andraea manage to once again create a story that is educational, fun and a definate buy.",Yvette Spangenberg
9781841215655,what a beautiful book. My daughter got this as a gift from her kindergarten 10 years ago. It is a truly lovely read Highly recommend,Paula Mulholland
9781841215655,"my 1 1/2 year old son loves this book, however, his favourite part isnt the story or the giraffe but instead the cricket that plays the violin. He's hidden on every page and the fun for my son was finding him.... it provided months of entertainment for him!!",amanda donovan
9781841215655,"The words flow so beautifully, and it sounds fantastic read aloud. The illustrations capture expressions, and have movement (perfect for a book about dancing!). The message of the story is a nice one too.",Katherine Kerr
9780152067045,"Our absolute favorite! Teaches kids lots of concepts (near sheep/far sheep), can be read in any language, kids catch on quickly and the ending is fantastically fabulous! Our 18-month-old who has a slight problem to be gentle with books completely melts at the last page and kisses the sleeping sheep ;)",Pavel Ondrejovic

9780859537278,"This is a book I remember from when I was a kid and it was read to me at school, I loved it that much and so I bought it for mine. As she is only 9 months, she can't appreciate the rhymes yet but enjoys the pictures and poking her finger through the wholes.",janice
9780859537278,"..... and her 7 year old brother!!.... The cut out design of the book makes things a little more interesting for the younger kids, seeing all the animals inside the old ladys' stomach. Useful for reciting from memory when driving to keep little people calm. I like it,",Elizabeth Clarke
9780859537278,"""My daughter thinks this is a wonderful book! The repetitiveness is one of the reasons it's great for children. Both my kids like the hole in the book - it's good for poking! I have been reading this to my oldest since she was 2, she's now close to 5 and I think as time goes on, and she's become more familiar with the words she likes it even more! I expect she'll be saying it word for word with me before too long. And if anyone is worried about the PC of it - my daughter will tell you 'It's just a funny silly book!'.""",a Book Depository customer

9780142405802,"This is a beautiful story much loved by my son. I bought a copy as a present for a friend and was disappointed to discover when it arrived that it is a US edition, even though this is not marked on the description. Look out for US spelling ""gray"" rather than ""grey"" and the snail ""hitching a ride"" rather than ""hitching a lift"".",Sarah Wilcox
9780142501122,"Room on the Broom is another delightful rhyming book from the creators of The Gruffalo. This is a fun book to read aloud with children of all ages, but is especially good for preschoolers and lower primary school children. The illustrations are nice, and the story is funny, and I enjoy sharing this one with my kids. There is a dragon in this story, which my kids thought was a little scary the first time we read the book, but that hasn??????C/??t stopped them requesting many re-reads! This is one of our favourite picture books.",Sara Reid
9780142501122,"Both my children love this book especially after watching the story unfold on tv once. It is definitely a favourite of mine too, I love it when my 2 year old says the lines with me! A great read for the whole family.",Melissa Leader
9780142501122,This is by far my favourite book to read my 2 and 4 year old. They both love it! There's plenty of opportunity for putting on voices which my 2 year old especially enjoys. I'd highly recommned it. In fact most of Julia Donaldson's books are great to read!,Tanja Hoogenboom
9780142501122,"My children aged 2 and 4 absolutely love this book, at the moment it is requested every night. My 4 year old is at the stage of nearly being able to know it off by heart and even my two year old chimes in as we read it with ""whoosh they were gone"". What's best is that I haven't even tired of reading it every night - fantastic book!",Lyndal
9780142501122,My two kids (4yr & 2yr) love it as well as me. It is one of my favorite bedtime story. I think I even love it more than my kids.,Felicity
9780142501122,"My neighbour's five-year-old daughter asks to borrow it every time she comes over. She has been doing this for two years. As she turns the pages, a smile blooms on her face. That is enough review for me.",JY Lou Kraska
9780545261241,"Felt that the humor is rather crude for young children e.g. Donkey farts greenish gas and bird faints. The illustrations were quite disturbing to my 3 year old. She kept asking why the bird plucked out the donkey's eye, why the donkey was crippled with only three legs (a metal leg on an animal in place of a normal one can look v scary to a young child), what it means to be cranky 'because he had no coffee', why his teeth looked brownish(rotten). As this was a board book, I thought it was meant for younger children. But I found it can be quite jarring on a young child's mind.",Lizzy
9780545261241,"We originally came across the song and loved it so much we had to get the book too. My 9 month old loves this but ideally its probably ideal for 2yrs-6yrs. If you can get hold of the country song it transforms the story, its got great rhythm and silly lyrics, I haven't meet a kid or adult alike who hasn't had a good giggle from this.",Amy Deering
9780545261241,"My daughter was all excited when she saw this book as the teacher had read it to the class at kinder with the cd. When it arrived I read it to her several times. ( I thought it was silly) but she was in histerics, especially when we watched the you-tube clip. Great value.",Jane Baker
9780545261241,"Truly awful book, the pictures are grotesque and the story crude. There are so many great childrens books out there but this is definitely not one of them!",Dr Eileen Smith
9780545261241,"Repetition and rhyming is soothing and enjoyable to children. It also increases learning in a fun way. My daughter found this story so funny and enjoyable and was quickly ""reading"" along with the book through easy recollection of the story from the rhyming. The book and the CD make her smile and laugh every read and listen, without fail. She is now learning to read and beginning to read along as well. Thoroughly enjoyable read for my daughter Thoroughly enjoyable watching the delight for Mum! Do you and your children a favour, read them this book. Many, many times.",Dianne

9781406331264,"My one-year-old absolutely loves this book... it's beautifully illustrated, showing babies from all around the world. The predictable rhythm of the book gives it a good pace, and keeps her turning the pages until the end. Highly recommend! It's one of our favs.",Rachel Chappell
9780007215997,A marvellous story of a tiger who unexpectedly knocked at the door and asked to have tea with a little girl Sophie and her mother. This book is a favourite with my daughter (as well as others we read it to). It is wonderful to read and we read it over and over again. Highly recommended.,Giselle Cooke
9780007215997,A simple funny story for reading aloud - kids would love how the tiger finishes everything that was laid out for tea.,Yvonne Lee
9781409303183,I think it's very important to share books with children for a very early age. My 10 months daughter loves these tiny books! She can turn the pages so easily!,Anita Romhalmi
9781409303183,"This collection comes in a mini-sized hard board quality packaging. The books are smaller than expected but am satisfied with the quality. The stories in each of the 6 books are rather short and concise, even simpler than Maisy's or Spot's in my opinion. My 4 years old daughter is still entice with this new addition. With a price like this that comes with free delivery half way across the globe, I give it a thumbs up!",May Wong

9780761157281,"The perfect book for the whole family. Tough enough to survive our 1 year old, full of interesting ideas for the adults and perfect for our 3 year old who is forever asking for new paper because of an imperfection added by her brother. High quaity, well written and fun.",Katie Black
9780761157281,"This is one of my favourite children's books ever. As a teacher I have read it to many children, and they love it so much I often read it more than once :) It has a great message and is the basis for many art activity ideas. Love it!!!",Jemma Elkington
9780761157281,I bought this for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has nearly memorised it. It's visually tasteful and well worded. My only hesitation was when my son thought he could make all rips beautiful (so we had to teach him not to tear books that had started with a rip). but that was only drummed in once. i recommend it for pre schoolers.,Natasha macaulay
9780761157281,"This book is amazingly beautiful, and the construction is classy, and very nice for a child to interact with. So if you love lovely things, buy this book. For me though, the problem is the text. If this was a self-help book for adults, or even late teens, then it might be appropriate to address the theme of the book (you can change your mistakes into something beautiful) in such a direct manner. For kids though, subtly, and the chance to make their own discoveries as a story progresses is the most wonderful aspect of reading. As it stands now, the book is bombastic, and yet without changing a single aspect of the page design, it really could be enchanting if the words told a story with a little heart.",Katherine Knapsey
9781406338539,"I bought this book for my daughter, but I end up reading it to every one of my friends when they come over. It's such a great book in it's simplicity and dead-pan delivery. Pure gold.",LisaMarie IORFINO

9780141385112,Received my order and am surprised that it can actually fit into my mailbox! The books are much smaller than expected - but I guess my boy would be able to hold it nicely with his hands. Hope he'll love it!,Juay Puay Yong

9780141385112,Very cute books but ALOT smaller then I thought they would be. I received them in the mail today and the entire set fit into the palm of my hand which will be good for my one year old but I can't see them lasting her for very long.,Jennifer
9780141385112,"My 2 year old daughter loves these books! Her favorite is Colors, she keeps pointing to the beautiful butterfly on the last 2 pages.

I would definitely recommend this library!",Marija Fabiani Cuk
9780152632243,"Kids will love it. Has a lyrical tone to it. Full of fascinating little details for the growing minds. A bundle of implicit values and heaps of fun! And if that's not enough, it introduces kids to Aussie fauna, geography and food culture at an early age.",Gaurav Gupta
9780152632243,"My children (25 months and 5 months) adore this book, as I did when I was a child. 'Possum Magic' is timeless in its appeal, with its lovely narrative and beautiful pictures. I purchased this particular edition for a 12 month old cousin from South Africa. It is the perfect gift from Australian relatives to overseas children. I wish 'Possum Magic' was available in board book format.",Diana Boswarva

9780152060305,I wish I read the reviews before buying this book! I was absoluately horrified to see that the pages of this book have been cropped! What is this!? A Chinese knock off!? I am so upset with the Book Depository right now! This is a beautiful book but this copy of it is horrible! Avoid at all costs!,Monika Olley
9780152060305,"Although this version of this book is the cheapest available from the Book Depository, it has substantially cropped edges. Each page has a thick, intricate border, as if the picture were in a picture frame. On every page, this border is partially, or on some pages completely cropped out. I've read it as it is supposed to be presented, so I know that this is NOT as intended by Mem Fox. Although it is potentially a plus that the picture itself is larger as a result, the variability of the cropping makes it rather unsightly. I've never seen a printing mistake this profound in a legitimately printed book, and I question the Singaporean printing house. I suggest spending a few extra dollars and buying a different version of this book. The story itself has an important message for children of inclusiveness and tolerance..",Kelly Adams
9780152060305,This book is simply a joy to read to children. It freely offers them the opportunity to question differences and helps to teach them that everyone is united. A must for every home library.,Suzanne Hurley
9780152060305,"""Another brilliant Mem Fox book. It's long been popular in our family. The artwork is captivating. The littler members of our family enjoy finding 'the flying man' in each picture.

9780811879545,This is one of those universally loved books that children just can't get enough of. From the age of 3 my daughter would ask to read it over and over again (to say it is know off by heart is no exaggeration). Loved still by older children (8 years). Recommend for every bookshelf,GP
9780670882786,"My mother bought this book last Christmas, for my then 17 month old daughter, as she had fond memories of reading it to me when I was small.

9780670882786,"This book is a fabulous start to the ""I spy"" game. Each page has a rhyme that tells you who is hiding in the picture. Eg ""Cinderella on the stairs, I spy three bears"". The pictures are detailed enough to add interest, but not so detailed that the child cant find the character (not like Richard Scary books or Where's Wally?). We have read it so many times my daughter (2.5 years) can point to whose hiding in seconds, but this doesnt detract from her enjoyment. She likes the sense of mastery it gives her. I would say its great for 18 months to 3 years. Worth having in your collection. Gender neutral.",Roslyn Hughes
9780670882786,"I was sent this from a friend in the UK (through Book Depository) to read with my 4yo grand daughter. She loves it! We find new things in the pictures every time.

9781846432767,"My 2 year old daughter loves this book and will have us read it to her a few times a day. Unlike many of her other books that are about animals she can relate to all the pictures - eating, bathing, changing clothes, going for walks and story time which is why I think she likes it so much. I think this book good for preparing my daughter for her new sibling because the children in the pictures could be either sex so we can address them to suit our situation. There are pictures showing baby nursing while older sibling eats, being carried while older sibling walks and words that remind me to explain why this is. Baby is also shown crying and sleeping a lot. In each picture older sibling is included in the action and in one page shown as helping wash the baby. The last two pages shows older sibling touching baby who has fallen asleep and then in the final page older sibling gets parents all to herself.",janice
9781846432767,"I have purchased a couple of books for my toddler to help prepare him for his new sibling. This book is our favourite. It has big, bright illustrations, a very simple storyline, and every page has something that my son can relate to. I really like that the baby is gender neutral, as we don't know what we are having yet. I think this is a great book for a young toddler. My son is 20 months old, so I found this simple ideas in this book are perfect for him. I am still not sure if he fully understands that there is a new baby on the way, but we read this book every day now, and he seems to be getting it a bit more.",Fiona Cahill
9781844285136,"This book is an all time family favourite. The story begins with a bus driver asking the reader to keep an eye on his bus while he attends to something and to be sure and not let the pigeon drive the bus. The pigeon, of course, tries every argument and tactic in the book to convince the reader to let him fulfill his dream of driving the bus. It is a simply presented story because it is so well told and cleverly witty that it doesn't need more. Big and little kids will get the humour as we can all relate to having behaved in a similar way to the pigeon at some stage in life when we have been denied something that we want. Having borrowed this book numerous times from the library, we bought it for our daughter who simply giggles every time this book is read, along with mum and dad. Do yourself a favour and read this.",leigh Mckechnie
9781844285136,"Complete disappointment. The illustrations are bland and completely repetitive, and the storyline is completely lacking in humour or educational purpose. This is perhaps the only book in my child's vast collection that she has not liked.",Lottos Gutierrez
9781844285136,"Our 3 year old toddler, my partner and myself absolutely love reading this book. It's one book that we never tire of reading and we ALWAYS have a giggle. Pigeon is such a character and has us in stitches with his negotiations, scheming, plotting and temper tantrums. We love how involved our son gets with the characters in the book. I know my son will be absolutely delighted to receive some of the other Mo Willems 'Pigeon' series books for Christmas.",Farrah Tate

9780312601553,"This is a beautiful little board book to read to baby. We use this as part of her bedtime routine and as soon as we read this one, she snuggles right in. It's a very sweet story about how special baby is, because ""On the night you were born, the moon smiled with such wonder, the stars peeked in to see you and the night wind whispered life will never be the same. Because there had never been anyone quite like you ever before. So enchanted with you were the wind and the rain that they whispered the sound of your wonderful name! Not once had there been such eyes, such a nose! Such silly wiggly wonderful toes. When the polar bears heard, they danced until dawn. From far away places the geese flew home....."" and so it continues. it's a very sweet book and I highly recommend it",Brooke

9780061900624,"I got this for my niece who will be welcoming a little sister some time in the next few months. It's quite cute and shows what's involved in becoming a big sister in ways a small child could understand with sweet illustrations. However, beware if giving it as a gift - it has a little advice section in the back for parents, which although is quite nice and handy, it could rub certain more opinionated parents up the wrong way..",Jurgen Stipplington
9780340903179,Really love this book - it has fantastic illustrations and is easy to read aloud to kids. Great that it teaches children (and adults too!) that worries are only as serious as we make them out to be. Definitely a book for keeps!,Yvonne Lee

I am a pre-school teacher now and recently re-discovered brave, naughty Ping and was so happy to re-read a story I loved so much again. I still loved his adventure! But I was worried about how my current audience of 3 and 4 yr olds would respond to it's, not PC and very traditional, story line. They were enthralled! Ping is a story that stands the test of time. My kids request ""that little duck story"" frequently now and I just love reading it every time.",kelly smith

Ping hides to avoid trouble, only to find himself in much greater trouble - in fact - he nearly becomes a duck dinner!

While the moral is to promote sharing I'm not completely comfortable with how the little fish made friends by giving away its scales which is a part of the little fish. I bought this book online because it has a beautiful cover without knowing its content. Now that I have it I find myself having to explain to my child that the other fish shouldn't have asked the rainbow fish for its scales and that they should have gotten to know the rainbow fish because despite rainbow fish being different he was a nice fish and would have made a great friend and conversely friends that are bought aren't good friends...etc I don't recommend this book.

No matter what subject he's writing about, or speaking about, behind it all is the universal theme of diversity and acceptance.

Some families have children who are adopted, while some families even have two moms or two dads. Regardless of how your family is made up, all families share some of the same things: they like to hug, they like to celebrate together, and sometimes they're even sad together.

With a beautifully simplistic narrative, hysterically emotionless characters, and wonderfully dark undertones that entertain Mum & Dad.

The sticker book is good quality too and the stickers have nice frames there. So as I was saying in the title, it is wonderful gift for Harry Potter fans.

Whilst I think the artist is very skilled and I have enjoyed colouring some of the mandalas, I simply don't like some of them.

9780064440219,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader. Another fine collection of short stories about friends Frog and Toad. Frog is the wiser one with Toad being the one with more silly ideas. As usual we have five stories which are not related to each other. In the first Toad decides to write a list of everything he will do that day and he does not deviate from it until he looses the list, which creates quite the problem. Next Frog gives Toad some seeds to plant his own garden and Toad is very impatient for them to grow. He talks to them, yells at them, sings to them, reads them stories, plays music etc. all to no avail. The third story has Frog and Toad with a freshly baked bowlful of cookies which they can't stop eating and they try to come up with a way to make the cookies inaccessible so they can no longer eat anymore and make themselves sick. The fourth story has Frog and Toad wanting to be brave like the heroes in fairy tales so they take a walk up a dangerous mountain and encounter various dangers along the way running quickly back home and feeling quite brave. Finally Toad has a dream where he can do all sorts of performing arts in a theatre where Frog is watching him. But after each act Frog gets smaller and smaller, until Toad looses his friend altogether. Wonderful stories for all ages, but I think ""Frog and Toad All Year"" is my favourite so far.",Nicola Mansfield
9780064400565,"""Stuart Little"" is commendably original and I was delighted with the first half. Go with the flow of an author's imagination and you'll experience new realms. They needn't match the nature of our world but logic should balance within a tale. Two instances of Stuart's behaviour, derailed the character for me, enough to lower my assessment. I was startled by a mouse-looking life form, who wasn't an adoptee but a human's offspring. It's okay that the phenomena is unexplained because this isn't an adult novel that would expand fully. Problems like turning taps on sinks and getting rolled into window shades, were interesting. A loving family cared about each other, with their own peculiarity. I read a criticism in another review that the parents enlisted Stuart's help inside a drain and a piano. I say it illustrated his size could be useful, instead of something to regret. Imagine the esteem of a tiny person: ""This is something you need me to do""! The race was a fun chapter and not an unconnected device to generate excitement. Stuart befriends the dentist there and his knowledge of watercraft comes up again too. The bird, Margalo, is the loveliest addition and searching for her becomes the heart of the book. What bothered me is Stuart not telling his family he was going, nor having the dentist call them. When he visits a post office, it is to invite a miniature girl on a boat ride that unravels pointlessly, instead of contacting his parents. They were once frantic while he was merely lost inside the house. Perhaps E.B. White intended a sequel. I found the very best part short-changed, by leaving the search on-going. The end pages would soar exponentially with the emotion of a reunion. Instead we close flatly, on a poorly-handled date.",C. Riedel

9780064440592,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader. I've always enjoyed Arnold Lobel, but as a kid these Frog and Toad books didn't appeal to me so I've only discovered there charm as an adult. This book sees the two friends through the year with a story for each of the seasons, beginning and ending with winter. In the first story Frog forces Toad out of the house to enjoy the winter weather but Toad would rather be home warm and snug in his bed. Next, on a rainy Spring day Frog tells Toad a story of his childhood when his father told him Spring was just around the corner, so Frog started looking around corners trying to find Spring. Next comes summer and Toad buys two Chocolate ice cream cones to take back for him and Frog to eat. Along the way the summer sun melts them and Toad becomes a frightening mess, scaring everyone he meets along the way. Autumn is my favourite season and this was ds's favourite story. Frog finds his yard full of leaves to be raked so he decides to sneak over to Toad's place and rake his leaves, while at the same time Toad has had the very same bright idea. They both work hard all day long and as they walk home a wind picks up and they arrive back home to see that tomorrow they will have to rake their own yards. But each goes to bed feeling good about how the other must feel to have come home to find his yard raked for him. And finally we finish off with a Christmas Eve story, where Toad is worried what is keeping Frog so long to arrive and imagines all sorts of terrible things that could have happened to him on the way so he prepares a rescue kit for every possibility before he goes in search of him. Lovely stories of friendship with Lobel's usual delightful illustrations.",Nicola Mansfield

9781843109006,"I ordered this in anticipation of potty training my son. When it arrived I thought it looked too boring and basic but I was wrong. It is very simple but that is the genius of it. No bells and whistles. It just explains what happens when you eat food, where it goes, how it makes your tummy feel and that when your tummy aches a bit that means it is time to sit on the toilet and try to do a poo. It seems so obvious but to a child the process and connection between it all isn't obvious so this really helps them to understand. Neither of my kids ever had a problem with learning to poo on the toilet/potty immediately after reading this a few times and my daughter (2.5) still asks me to read it numerous times whenever she goes for a poo. She always shouts ""Good job, Liam!"" at the end of the book after he does his poo. Also a friend of mine was having terrible trouble potty training her son and after weeks he was still refusing to poo in a toilet or potty. By chance I looked after him for a few hours one day and read him the book and he actually went into the toilet 5 minutes later and did his first poo on the toilet - my friend was amazed and thrilled!

9780439678131,"After finishing Collins' phenomenal series The Hunger Games, I was hungry for more. I hadn't heard anything about her debut or the following books in the series, but it sounded good so I decided to give it a try. And I'm ever so glad I did, because Gregor proves to be just as exciting as The Hunger Games. In this first book of the series, we meet Gregor, an 11-year old guy with a two-year-old sister called Boots. When Boots goes through a grate in their laundry room, Gregor follows her and soon they find themselves in the Underland, a world without a sun where enormous animals live besides the humans. The animals have distinct personalities, from the giant cockroaches to the loyal bats who carry 'their' humans. While this is a middlegrade series, it reads very quickly and it's just as exciting as Collins' young adult series. The writing is to the point and makes it easy to imagine everything that's happening, even the talking insects, rats and bats. I loved how fast paced it was, how much adventure there was and how likeable the characters are. Gregor is a great main character and you cannot possibly read the story without liking Boots. She's small and still a toddler, but she's a feisty one at that! If you're looking for a fast paced, adventerous and exciting middle grade fantasy, this is the book for you!",Daphne for Loving Books
9780439678131,"After surviving a bizarre fall through a gateway to the Underland--conveniently located in the laundry room of their NYC apartment building--eleven-year-old Gregor and his two-year-old sister Boots discover a world filled with giant talking cockroaches, rats, spiders, and bats. The humans of this formidable world take them in as ""guests,"" but, as Gregor astutely observes, ""Guests could leave it they wanted to"" (p. 54). Not knowing whom to trust, Gregor flees the palace with Boots, inadvertently igniting the prophesied war between the humans and rats. Highlighting Gregor's role as the consistently responsible older brother, Collins creates a heroic character for young adult readers even before revealing that Gregor is about to fulfill his destiny as ""an Overland Warrior, a Son of the Sun"" (p. 109). Yes, there is violence, but not simply for the sake of being violent; Collins's use of violence is appropriate to her story. Gregor is a great introduction for readers who are new to the fantasy genre. The main characters are human, and are well-grounded in reality--New York City, doing laundry, babysitting, summer camp. Still, there is enough of the fantastic--giant talking animals, gateways into another world, prophecies--to stimulate the imagination and introduce newcomers to fantasy without being overwhelming.

Throw in Toothless, Hiccup's disobedient dragon who has a knack for trouble, and his evil cousin, Snotface Snoutlout, and you have a recipe for almost certain disaster. However, things change from embarrassingly to deadly in a snap. During a Reindeer Herding Lesson, the entire class nearly perishes in a freak forest fire. It turns out that the volcano is becoming active and thousands of vicious dragons called Exterminators are hatching from the heat. Hiccup and his best friend, Fishlegs, don't look like hero material. They are both eleven years old and the scrawniest boys in their Viking class. But through some luck and clever sleuthing, they uncover why the volcano is erupting and how to stop it. Once again, it all boils down to Hiccup to throw together a quest and save the day. Cressida Cowell's fifth story in THE HEROIC MISADVENTURES OF HICCUP HORRENDOUS HADDOCK III, HOW TO TWIST A DRAGON'S TALE, is a hilarious and fun read. Her Vikings, while unhygienic and violent, sing in perfect harmony. Almost every page is illustrated with black and white drawings or pithy song lyrics. This book is an odd combination of the strange and the familiar. Readers will encounter dragons of all kinds, a bit of magic, a few bullies, and the seriously weird but typical antics of parents.",TeensReadToo

9780142417119,"This book was spectacular! I really enjoyed reading it, very addicting. The story takes place in a sort of Asian themed world. Although the world itself is purely created by the author, Goodman did mirror some of the past elements of Asian culture and society, which I thought was a wonderful addition to the overall setting. Beautiful descriptions! The plot, while steady throughout the novel, seemed to fly by the last quarter or so! There was some predictability, and I was frustrated with Eon/a for not figuring it out earlier when it's so blatantly obvious! For a fairly smart boy/girl, she was considerably dense when it came to this aspect! Despite my frustrations, it did play out nicely within the plot, and while I became increasingly frustrated in this one element of the story I totally missed the obviousness of another! But perhaps that is what Goodman had planned all along. The characters were all fascinating and well-developed. My favorites had to be Lady Dela, Ryko, and Chart. Goodman's writing is filled with rich details! I loved the descriptive elements! Did I mention that already!? Can I just say that I really had no idea what a eunuch was and not come across as ignorant? I actually learned a thing or two while reading EON: DRAGONEYE REBORN.

It's a very good book for children, as I could attest with my 4yo cousin, even though it's a tad manichean (as in - good guys and bad guys are easy to spot and are indeed good and bad).

9780064440943,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader. This has always been one of my favourites of Lobel's books! While the whole story is about Grasshopper's journey, each chapter is episodic and tells a humorous tale of someone he meets along the way. These are so silly, they will have you laughing out loud along with your children. Ds enjoyed this one very much. He loves it when something silly or outrageous happens in a story and this kept him giggling. My favourite part is when he meets the beetles who love morning and they let Grasshopper join the club, giving him a sign and a wreath of flowers but as soon as he mentions he likes afternoon and evening as well they kick him out of the club and call him a 'dummy'. Ds's favourite is the story of a mosquito who insists that all must be ferried across the lake in his boat, no matter what. Well, the lake is a puddle and grasshopper won't fit into the boat and could easily hop over 'the lake'. The mosquito won't hear of it though, and grasshopper comes up with a great idea so as not to hurt mosquito's feelings. Since he can't fit in the boat he picks it up and carries it across the 'lake' and mosquito is happy that he has ferried Grasshopper across. Lovely illustrations, of course.

9780064410939,"Reason for Reading: Read aloud to ds. I'll keep this one short. There must be thousand's of reviews already of this modern classic. The edition that I have is the hardcover reprint with the gently colourized original illustration by Rosemary Wells, a beautiful book and a keeper for my personal library. This was my first re-read since my original reading as a child and it struck me again as being a wonderful book so full of feeling, even though I'd seen the cartoon movie year after year as a child. I was surprised that Fern wasn't really that big a part of the story as I had expected her to be and Templeton was all Paul Lynde to me. I heard his voice every time he spoke! This was my son's first exposure to Charlotte's Web. I've kept him away from the new version of the movie purposely until we'd read the book and the animated version just doesn't show up on TV like it used to. I wouldn't say say he absolutely loved it. He didn't cry are feel bad at the end, at all. It was very much ""c'est la vie"" for him. But he did laugh at all the funny parts and enjoyed Wilbur as a character the most. Oh, and the geese, he loved their double talk! So he enjoyed the book and we've got a hold on the animated movie version at the library to watch and will watch the newer real life version if he's interested afterwards for comparison. (I personally do not like talking animal movies). For myself it was a great enjoyment to re-acquaint myself with the original book and remember why E.B. White was such a beloved children's author. Why did he have to leave us with only three children's books, though?? That is the sad part. The Trumpet of the Swan is still my favourite of the three.",Nicola Mansfield

9780316016681,"Although WE BELONG TOGETHER is geared towards adoptive parents and their children, any family can benefit from reading the book, especially if done so together. Although I've read some negative reviews about the book, statements made that it gives the wrong message to adopted children, I don't think that's the case at all. Both of my children have, at one time or another, asked why they were our kids and not someone elses. How is it that we became their parents, and not the parents of some other children? For younger children, who don't know all of the details of how becoming a parent works, this is a valid question. My answer has always been the same as the one Todd Parr provides within the pages of the bright, bold, beautifully illustrated WE BELONG TOGETHER: because you needed love, and I had a lot to give. This book, although it doesn't mention birth parents, makes the act of adoption a two-way street: both child and parent need something (love, learning, shelter, fun & laughter), and both have things to give in return (a hug & a kiss, knowledge, safety). I think that this is a great book for adopted families, especially when read together. But all families will enjoy it, and the positive message of love and acceptance that it gives.",TeensReadToo

9780547595290,"i bought this book for my son who is 4 years old. it is absolutely magical. there are 8 stories in this book (which is of very high quality, the binding is strong, the pages are rip resistant and the ink is exquisite). my son's bedtime routine includes having 2 bedtime stories read to him each night, and each story takes about 10 minutes to read .well, it takes us about 15 minutes because we like to discuss the beautiful illustrations on each page before moving on to the next page..., but if you are only reading the story without discussing what George is doing in the illustrations then it only takes about 10 minutes to read each story. as you have probably guessed, the illustrations in this book are first class. any child between the ages of 2 and (i would say) 7 will love them, but children older than this will probably be past the Curious George stage anyway, but if your child IS older than this and still loves Curious George then they will love them too. the stories themselves are told in a very easy to read and understand manner that will have both parents and children laughing out loud at George's antics. this book is so worth buying, either for your own son or daughter or as a gift for a friend's/relative's son or daughter in the right age group. it is one of the best books i have ever bought for my son, and he has a LOT of books Enjoy!",marleen molloy

9780694012275,"I found that there was a rather limited selection of good, meaningful christmas books for kids that really hit home the real meaning of christmas. Most are either very dated and have a heavy text to them, or they swing to the other extreme and completely negate the real reason or theology behind christmas and are simply just about santa or presents. 'Christmas in a Manger' was a lovely find, engaging with the real reason for Christmas but still a fun, simple and uncomplicated book, appropriate even for those who are not 'religious'. I used if from when my son was just a baby and at 2+ now, he's still finding it quite a fun read. Here are some things that I really like about the book. - it's a board book, so very durable and easy for the child to handle as well. - the illustrations are simple but still pleasing to the eye. - each page opens and has 4 lines that rhyme and these are printed in a very easy to read font. - because it rhymes it's easy for kids to read and imitate. - the sparkly star - my kids like it Something a bit strange that I can't quite figure out is why the page with Mary and Joseph has the picture on the left and the text on the right - that's the only page in the book like that. Also, I know books can be pricey, this one is reasonable, maybe slightly more than I'd normally pay. Lastly, I think a good book is one that you would buy other people. This is a book that I would keep buying for friends that have kids as a nice Christmas present.",DT

For teaching it may be exciting. But, I'm disappointed as a scientist and octopus lover - they are so intelligent - that it doesn't reveal the true characteristics of octopuses.

(I took care to give no obvious spoilers about the story) <b>Title:</b> Julie of the wolves <b>Author:</b> Jean Craighead George <b>Format:</b> paperback <b>Pages:</b> 170 <b>ISBN:</b> 0064400581 <b>Back cover text:</b> To her small Eskimo village, she is known as Miyax; to her friend in San Fransisco, she is Julie. When the village is no longer safe for her, Miyax runs away. But she soon finds herself lost in the Alaskan wilderness, without food, without even a compass to guide her. Slowly she is accepted by a pack of Arctic wolves, and she grows to love them as though they were family. With their help, and drawing on her father's teachings, Miyax struggles day by day to survive. But the time comes when she must leave the wilderness and choose between the old ways and the new. Which will she choose? For she is Miyax of the Eskimos - but Julie of the Wolves. <b>First alinea of chapter 1:</b> Miyax pushed back the hood of her sealskin parka and looked at the Arctic sun. It was a yellow disc in a lime-green sky, the colors of six o'clock in the evening and the time when the wolves awoke. Quietly she put down her cooking pot and crept to the top of a dome-shaped frost heave, one of the many earth buckles that rise and fall in the crackling cold of the Arctic winter. Lying on her stomach, she looked across a vast lawn of grass and moss and focused her attention on the wolves she had come upon two sleeps ago. They were wagging their tails as they awoke and saw each other. <b><i>Review:</i></b> <b>Story:</b> I had wanted to read this book as I had often seen it recommended together with Scott O O'Dell's <a href=""http://www.librarything.nl/work/6215"">Island of the blue dolphins</a>, which was a book I really enjoyed. The story wasn't exactly what I expected (I was thinking along the lines of a Jungle Book -like story), but I thought it was nice that Miyax' interaction with the wolves was the way it was (and not a re-telling of Jungle Book in the Arctic). I thought the second part, of her memories, and the last part were the most interesting. The first part deals mainly with Miyax getting to know the wolves, but during that part I got curious about her past (which was explained in the second part). I liked the third part because there she chooses between going to live with her pen-friend in San Fransisco or staying where she is. I've seen there are sequels, but I don't think I'm going to read those. I like the story as it was concluded in this book! (I also read that there is a sequel to Island of the blue dolphins, but for the same reason as with this book I don't plan on reading the sequel). <b>Illustrations:</b> The book has some black-and-white illustrations, drawn with a lot of lines to indicate shadows/highlights. They're located at the beginning of each part (the book is divided into three parts: with the wolves, memories of how Miyax came to ran away, and the conclusive part in the present) and at some important scenes in the story. The drawings really fit in the story's mood and I think they're beautifully drawn. The wolves also look very realistic in the drawings. <b>Writing style:</b> It really is a childrens' book, so the writing style is quite simple and the sentences are short. There was quite a lot of description of the events. The surroundings were also described a lot, but not too much - just enough to get a good idea of Miyax' world. <b>Rereadability:</b> No, I'm not going to re-read it. It was nice to have read this book, because it was a nice story, but there are a lot more (childrens') books I liked a lot better.",S. Broers

One day he gets his very own beautiful bay pony for his birthday and names it Blaze because of the white streak down its face. Billy and Blaze go riding through the fields and woods. Billy rescues a dog from a trap, names it Rex and, since the owner could not be found, keeps it for a pet. Billy and Blaze learn to jump over fences and fallen trees with ease, but are they good enough to win the gleaming silver cup at the Mason Horse Show? This charming story is the first book in the classic Billy and Blaze series. Author and illustrator Clarence William Anderson (1891-1971) is best-known for his ""Billy and Blaze"" books which revolve around proper care of the horse while teaching a valuable lesson. All of the tales which Anderson wrote were based on true events or people that he knew--only the plots were fictitious. The Billy and Blaze stories are enjoyable, and the lively black and white illustrations are incredibly beautiful and realistic. There are a total of eleven books about Billy and his horse.

This is probably not a true issue with the book, because these hints are done very wittily and with humor. I've now heard there's a sequel, so I'd like to read it too!",Tarissa

9781599902753,"DRAGON SLIPPERS is one of the best fantasy books I've read in ages! I always feel like good fantasy is hard to find, but this book certainly succeeded in being that and much more. When Creel's parents die, her rather silly aunt is going to be hard-pressed to come up with the money to feed Creel and her brother, so she comes up with a plan. She's going to give Creel to the dragon rumored to live in the hills near their town and convince a local nobleman's son to rescue and marry the ""fair maiden."" Anyone with sense knows this is ridiculous. The dragon is only a myth...Right? Wrong. Creel, however, is clever enough to talk her way out of the hands of the dragon (who doesn't really want to eat her, and, by the way, collects shoes, not gold), and out of the bargain she gets a comfortable pair of blue slippers, which she wears on the long walk to the capitol, where she wants to find work putting the sewing and embroidering skills taught to her by her mother to use. It seems like a simple enough plan; however, life is never as simple as we think it is going to be. DRAGON SLIPPERS is an un-put-downable read, set in a vividly created fantasy world. The characters are wonderful, too (although I feel the storytelling, rather than the characters, is Jessica Day George's strength in this story). DRAGON SLIPPERS is an excellent novel, one sure to appeal to fantasy fans of all ages. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780071408271,"Although it is primarily intended for children and young beginners, I think it could be a valuable addition to any Japanese students library. Hundreds of words each have their own illustrations and most pages have large, beautiful composite drawings. The subjects are incredibly diverse and include very useful and some unusual and fun words as well. The book uses English, roomaji, kana and kanji, so even advanced learners can use it to improve their kanji skills. I teach Japanese and find myself using this book as a support material for various age groups. I own several picture dictionaries of the sort, but I find this one the best by far. Highly reccomended!",Lilla

When ever I have a few minutes to spare I just take this book out and memorize a few more words. I find it easier to remember with the help of some illustrations.

The pictures are well illustrated too which is a plus point. Further, most of the words are written in Kanji. This provides good exposure to beginners of the Japanese language. No doubt one would not be able to memorize all the different Kanji if they are still at the Hiragana and Katakana level. However in time to come, it would serve as a good reference material once learners have advanced to the Kanji level in learning Japanese.",Fal

9780735841673,"If you're looking for a new picture book to share with your family, Lindbergh is the one to pick. Before the Spirit of St. Louis became an airplane... before Charles Lindbergh flew across the ocean... THERE WAS A MOUSE WHO LIVED IN HAMBURG. This mouse, a courageous inventor and pilot, dared to go where no four-legged creature had aspired to go before. To the skies. Studious and intelligent, this mouse has been presented with a problem: the appearance of metal contraptions to which his other furry friends, one by one, have succumbed to. He decides his best chance at survival would be in America -- but how? Although ships could take him to his desired destination, he runs into predicaments at the docks... leaving him nowhere else to turn to except the uncharted, faraway clouds. With a Victorian-era steampunk elegance, the illustrations in ""Lindbergh"" are stunning and beautiful. You'll find richly fascinating and tasteful details throughout the pages. (Oh, and the mice are so cute and cuddly!) The imagery truly ""makes"" the book, for the pictures alone speak volumes even without the accompanying text. Consistent with the vintage ambiance of the plot, the sepia-toned artwork beams with brilliance. Overall, young readers will pick up on historical cues and the pioneering aviation ideas. The story is about exhibiting fortitude and ingenuity against the odds... and innovation in the face of failure. You couldn't ask for any more from a book. It is PERFECT.

9781442430426,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. Well, I feel a bit guilty not giving this book a 5* rating but I must be honest, we were somewhat disappointed. For those not sure how this series works. It is made up of picture books and chapter books which in the long run are related to each other, same characters, but supposedly could be read apart from one another. The picture books are called ""The Guardians of Childhood"" while the chapter books are called ""The Guardians"". We are reading all the books in order as they are published and *highly* enjoying this series: the writing, the world-building, the plot and the illustrations. We came to this book, looking forward very much to the picture book format again, expecting to be taken back to the world of ""The Man in the Moon"" and perhaps a small insight into the continuing storyline as we know the next chapterbook is titled after the Sandman as well. First, our disappointment came in that this story is very much a stand-alone. Yes, the man in the moon (MiM) is briefly present but this is ""Sandy's"" story of how he came to be in the ""Golden Age"", a time far in the past before the events taking place in the chapter books. None of the chapter book characters are mentioned except of course the villain Pitch, neither is any of that plot, nor is the story advanced in anyway. In truth, while the Sandman is an interesting character, his story is rather boring and feels out of place within the context of the overall series. Some sort of continuity for readers of the entire series (picture & chapter) would have been appreciated. On the other hand, William Joyce is an illustrator extraordinaire. He should be remembered as one of the greats of our time to follow in the footsteps of the likes of N.C. Wyeth and the Hildebrandts. This book is exquisite. Each page is simply beautiful and the story, as it is, is fully realized with the fantastical, otherworldly illustrations which use a dark palette of blues, purples and browns contrasted with the bright glimmering yellow/gold light of the sandman, his sand, his star and the moon. Beautiful, beautiful! Recommended age is 5+ for reading aloud but quite a bit older for individual reading, perhaps 9/10+. Not what we had expected storywise, but nonetheless a gorgeous book.",Nicola Mansfield

9780441000319,"In the prologue to this fifth novel of Redwall, Ferahgo the Assassin, a weasel, has killed the badger lord Urthound and his wife Urthrun, leaving their two babies, one striped and the other white, to die of starvation. But do they die? Chapter one opens after many long seasons. Ferahgo and his Corpsemakers have slowly moved northward and are determined to capture Salamandastron, ruled by the badger lord Urthstripe and protected by the hares of the Long Patrol. However, Urthstripe's daughter Mara runs away with one of the hares named Pikkle Ffloger. Ferahgo's son Klitch tricks the two, and they are almost captured by the horde, but they escape, only to be deceived by a lizard named Slinkee who leads them to a group of cannibal toads under King Glagweb. However, they are rescued by Log-a-Log and his shrews, and together they set out to find the Blackstone, symbol of leadership among the shrews, which is now in the possession of the white ""ghost badger"" who lives on a mysterious island in the middle of a large lake. Their plan is then to head for Salamandastron and help in the fight against Ferahgo. Meanwhile, at Redwall, two deserters from Ferahgo's army, Thura and Dingeye, are taken in, but after they accidentally kill Brother Hal they escape with the sword of Martin the Warrior, intending to return to Ferahgo. A young squirrel named Samkim and a molemaid named Arula set out after them. Shortly afterwards, however, the abbey is plagued with Dryditch Fever, so the otter Thrugg and his little friend Dumble, a dormouse babe, set off for the Mountains of the North, ruled over by the golden eagle Wild King McPhearsome, to find Icetor Flowers which are said to cure the fever. After Thura dies of Dryditch fever and Dingeye is killed by the fox Dethbrush, whom Ferahgo had sent out to find them, Samkim and Arula, along with another group of shrews under the leadership of Alfoh, chase after Dethbrush, who now has the sword and is trying to escape in a boat through the same lake where Mara, Pikkle, and Log-a-Log have gone searching for the Blackstone. Will Samkim and Arula recover the sword of Martin the Warrior? Will Mara and Pikkle get the Blackstone back for Log-a-Log? Will Thrugg and Dumble return fever cure in time to save Redwall? And what will happen in the battle for Salamandastron? Some people may find the plot a little confusing, because the chapters go back and forth describing the activities of Urthstripe and Ferahgo at Salamandastron, of Mara and Pikkle on their journey as they look for the Blackstone, of Samkim and Arula in their search for the sword, of the Redwallers as they deal with the Dryditch Fever, and of Thrugg and Dumble seeking the Icetor Flowers. However, the story is told so well, in Jacques' inimitable style, that this should not be too much of a problem for most readers. The ""veiled curse du jour"" of this particular Redwall book is ""hellsteeth."" There are also a few common euphemisms and childish slang terms, such as gosh, darn, and ""frogsbum."" Otherwise, it has the usual strong sense of good versus evil, with no lack of villains to overcome and a host of quaint characters, such as Furgle, Tubgutt, Nordo, Spriggat, and Rocangus, to work together in overcoming them-and a few surprises along the way. I especially liked the way that Mara eventually comes to understand the truth, even though in the end it is a little late to do anything about it. That happens in real life sometimes. I have never read a Redwall book that I did not thoroughly enjoy.",Wayne S. Walker

Just like in LOVE THAT DOG, Jack uses poetry to discover his true feelings about some important things in his life, the two most important being his mother and cats.

I'd recommend it for anyone to read (teens, adults, or boys and girls 10 & up). I love the author's writing style... how the names of the people are never revealed--you only know Sounder's name. It seems to keep the other characters in a slight obscurity, as if there is a shadow over their face and you cannot see the person... but yet, you know everything about them.

9780064400206,"Sounder is a coon dog which lives with a poor, African-American family of sharecroppers in the post-Civil War South. The family consists of a father, a mother, an older son, and several younger children. The father struggles to feed his family in hard times. After working hard in the fields all day, he and Sounder go out hunting night after night but come home empty-handed. Then one morning, a ham is cooking in the cabin's kitchen. However, that evening, an angry sheriff and his deputies come to arrest the father for stealing food and take him away to jail. When Sounder tries to go along with his master, he is shot in the face and crawls away, whether to heal or to die no one knows. After the trial, the father is sent away to work in the chain gangs. Then the waiting begins for the boy, his mother, and the family-waiting for word from his father, waiting to hear Sounder's familiar bark, always waiting. After a while, the boy, angry and humiliated, begins going out all over the countryside to look for his father wherever he hears that there is a chain gang at work, returning home frequently to take his father's place in the fields. His search continues for a number of years. Along the way he encounters a lot of abuse from guards and others, but he also meets an elderly schoolteacher who helps him to learn how to read. But will he ever find his father? And what will happen to Sounder? This extremely well-written, powerful story, which won the Newbery Medal in 1970, clearly portrays the hopelessness of black sharecroppers during the late nineteenth century. Everything in the novel is understated, allowing the emotion to speak for itself. In addition to the history lessons on sharecropper life in the South, the book illustrates responsibility, faithfulness to family, and hard work. Even though she cannot read, the mother tells Bible stories to the children, and, encouraged by hearing about Joseph, David, and others, they patiently endure. William Howard Armstrong (1911-1999) is the author of some twenty other books, including Sour Land, a companion novel to Sounder. He based Sounder on stories told to him by an elderly African-American teacher who worked for his father.",Wayne S. Walker

9780061935084,"I've been wanting to read this forever! Not only because of the synopsis, but because opinions are divided when it comes to this book (or this series). Some loved it and some didn't and that's mainly why I wanted to finally finish it so I can have an opinion of my own. Truth is... I loved it! Dragons, love, friendship... I don't get how can someone not like it. Jacinda is a girl that knows from the very start who she is. She's not denying her draki, in fact she embraces it. Doing everything in her power to hold on to that side of her, defying rules... she's a tough one. Strong willed, unique, these are just some of her many many traits. The book puts a lot of emphasis on Jacinda's feelings and her struggle to keep her draki alive. I was glad to see she stays true to her nature, no matter what. I absolutely love the relationship Jacinda has with Will. I like to read a relationship building up, that's what's the most interesting part in my opinion, and then when the two characters are together, it's awful. It's all lovey dovey, puking rainbows and everything, speeches like 'I can't live without you', it's all just a big NO for me. Well, here it wasn't like that. When they first meet, when they're together, when they're not, I believe it's perfectly written because I enjoyed every moment they spent together. There's a little bit of a love triangle going on, though not that much... (I believe it's gonna happen more in the second book), but despite having two guys in the picture, she knows exactly who she loves and who she wants to spend her life with, she doesn't wonder. And when she does wonder, it's not for which guy to choose, is for what life she wants and where she can be more... herself. The story didn't lack action (and no, I'm not talking about Jacinda getting some, I'm talking about fights. And stuff. Bad stuff). Chases, fights, students going WHAAA-, evil people... you know, the usual. Overall, if you like fantasy books, dragons, a good written romance and basically everything I said above, then read Firelight. I'm giving it 5 stars, after all.",Ioana Culcea
9780061935084,"I love this cover! The fire red hair, eye scales makeup, and slitted pupils make the cover amazing. This book had me hooked by page one. I loved the idea that dragon like Draki could be in human form. What an exciting story idea! The plot was great, the characters likeable. The plot felt like reading a story from Edward's perspective (Twilight). The main character wasn't the innocent human this time but a powerful Draki trying to stay in human form with all her volatile emotions. Intense. The only thing that annoyed me about this book was the insta-love. There was a reason for it, but it still bothered me that their relationship was at a certain level before they decided to spend some time talking. Oh well, it was still enjoyable to read. Firelight was an intense, exciting, and deeply romantic book. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!

Goodreads Synopsis: A hidden truth. Mortal enemies. Doomed love. Marked as special at an early age, Jacinda knows her every move is watched. But she longs for freedom to make her own choices. When she breaks the most sacred tenet among her kind, she nearly pays with her life. Until a beautiful stranger saves her. A stranger who was sent to hunt those like her. For Jacinda is a draki-a descendant of dragons whose greatest defense is her secret ability to shift into human form. Forced to flee into the mortal world with her family, Jacinda struggles to adapt to her new surroundings. The only bright light is Will. Gorgeous, elusive Will who stirs her inner draki to life. Although she is irresistibly drawn to him, Jacinda knows Will's dark secret: He and his family are hunters. She should avoid him at all costs. But her inner draki is slowly slipping away-if it dies she will be left as a human forever. She'll do anything to prevent that. Even if it means getting closer to her most dangerous enemy. Mythical powers and breathtaking romance ignite in this story of a girl who defies all expectations and whose love crosses an ancient divide. My Thoughts: Well, let's see. Where can I even start? This book was amazing! So much drama! So much action! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! This has got to be among the top ten best books I've ever read in my life (which is honestly not that many.)Jordan has outdone herself with Firelight and I cannot wait to get my hands on Vanish and Hidden. I loved Jacinda! Her will to keep her Draki alive was so admirable. I also loved the aspect that she was such a rare comodity in among her kind. Jacinda being able to breath fire is such an amazing talent! As for Will, well, I think I have a new book boy crush! Tehehe. Will is so amazing! I can't describe much I want him to be my boyfriend! Even with the whole Draki hunter and Draki blood thing he has going on, I still wanted him so, so bad! His cousins and family, however, freak me out. They're all evil. How can Will be so different? I truly believe it stems from the fact that Draki blood flows through him. Tamra, in my opinion, was whiny sometimes,and bossy. And Jacinda and Tamra'a Mother was no better. I thought it was absolutely unfair that they were both looking to Jacinda to make all the big sacrifices so that they could live in the desert. I mean, come on! Ok, I get that the Mom made a HUGE sacrifice by giving up her Draki for Tamra, and took a huge risk for Jacinda by leaving the pride. Seriously though, when I think about it I applaud Mom for being brave enought to stand up for her babies and not let them be taken advantage of.",Golden Apple YA Book Reviews
9780061935084,"My Summary: Jacinda lives to fly and to make her own choices. But the pride makes both of those difficult. Born a draki -a descendant from dragons - Jacinda has an ability that has long been absent from the world. Her every move is watched and her future mate decided. Smothered but dealing, she breaks a rule that puts her and the pride at risk. Running for her life, she unexpectedly is saved by the very one sent to hunt her. Now she must hide in the mortal world to try and stay safe but the dry heat of Arizona stifles her draki. Her only hope is Will, the georgous boy that makes her draki come alive as it never has. But spending time with him risks her safety because Will has a secret too, one that risks not just Jacinda, but her family and the pride. How can she fight the pull to him that fires her insides and keeps her draki alive? How can she keep the secrets and protect the ones she loves? My Thoughts: 5 stars - a must read Since I listened to this book, let me start with the narrator. I don't think I have ever listened to Therese Plummer before but she did a fine job with this book. I wasn't distracted by her voice and I loved her reading Will. Very delicious. The draki world is a totally new world for me. I love paranormal. I love my vampires and werewolves but it's so fun to find something different. Magical abilities that are not available is so many other books. Sophie does that for me in Firelight. It was fun to learn about a world where draki live and hide with lots of different lure. Learning about Pride rules and culture, learning about family life in a pride, learning about alpha's rules that aren't always what the individual wants - it was all so much fun. Really enjoyed the world building. The characters were fabulous. It was interesting that Jacinda is a twin and yet her and her sister are so different. I won't tell you the big difference but I will say that while Jacinda is miserable in the human world, her sister Tamra is happy for the first time in her life. I keep thinking that the total opposite situation between them will have to be resolved at one point, but I am certainly getting ahead of myself. Jacinda is a typical teenager in that she wants to make her own choices and doesn't understand why her family won't accept her for what and who she is. Sounds familiar enough, but the differences to typical outweigh the similarities from there. Jacinda is struggles to decide what to do to survive as a draki and those decision change by the minute as she tries very hard to stay away from the one person who could both save her and destroy her. At first, I thought, make up your mind. But then I realized how much she sounded like the teens I spend so much time with at school. Her character rings very true. Cassian is still very much a mystery to me. We spend so little time with him but his character is so vital to the story. I'm sure there will be more of him in book two but for now, I'm not on his team. Sure, he's a hot male draki, strong and gorgeous but right now I'm not sure he's the best choice for Jacinda. Who is the best choice for her, well I'm committing to Team Will. He is a mystery that I don't think we know enough about yet, but he loves Jacinda. He protects her. He battles for her. He's kind. He forgives. He has these awesome hazel eyes that change from green to brown to gold depending on his mood. I Just can't resist that. As for the plot, I was surprised a couple of times. The story moved quickly and I really didn't want it to end. I read it in about a day. As for that ending, I cried. It was sad. But it's a book one and I can't expect everything to work out. It certainly makes me want to read book two. This is a fabulous read that you really should check out if you are the YA paranormal type, like me.",Valerie Fink
9780061935084,"I absolutely loved this book! The plot is fantastic. One doesn't often see such cleverly written novels about draki, or dragons. I was a little skeptical for that very reason, but there was something about it that made me take another look. I am very glad that I did. Sophie Jordan's writing style is very well developed. She has published other novels, but this her first in the YA genre. I think she has done a fantastic job at writing for teens. Firelight is a novel that could convert any a person who dislikes reading into one that cannot stop. It is really that good. Ms. Jordan dragged me into her fantastic world where I was held captive until the very end. The characters and love interests are very well developed. Jacinda is very strong and determined. She experiences many trials before she realizes that happiness may well be within her reach. She not only has to fight to preserve herself but also for her family and Will. Jacinda will do whatever it takes to keep her future bright and stay ""alive."" To do so, she has to have Will in her life, even if that means putting the lives of other draki in danger. Her development is important to the story and to the series and she is well on her way. Will is a fabulous love interest. I found myself cheering for him from the very beginning. When Will is first introduced to Jacinda, you know that he is not like his family. He is much different from them in many ways, but to avoid spoilers I will say that he is much more sympathetic and curious. Will really develops in this story and I can't wait to see how much of a role he plays in Vanish, the sequel. Cassian remains a mystery throughout the story. Sometimes he is possessive and uncaring, while other times he is sincere and kind. He is the future leader of their pride and is a very strong draki. He wants Jacinda for himself. She is mostly uninterested, but is a little unsure of her feelings. The epic tale will have readers' hearts torn in many directions and desperately awaiting the next book. The characters and relationships are eloquently built. Readers will find that they dislike some and love other right along with Jacinda, and with good reason. This story is definitely worth a trip to the bookstore or library to check out. You won't regret it. I know that I will be reading this again (possibly twice) before the sequel, Vanish, is released.",Raychelle Smith
9780061935084,"When i first saw this book, it immediately drew me in!they say 'don't judge a book by its cover', but this cover was surely very tempting and proved my assumptions correct. The story of Jacinda is something unique.Jacinda belongs to a pride of draki, human with the ability to manifest to dragons, that have survived throughout history.The draki exist in a limited number due to the fact that are tracked down and killed, sold for their rare skin and whatsoever. But what happens when the hunter falls in love with the prey?And the prey can't resist how alluring the hunter is because he is the only way to maintain the dying draki inside her? Surely, Jordan presented us a story that hasn't been said, like in other fiction books. The writing is really unique and caught my breath!Most of the times in the book you can actually share the feelings of Jacinda, feel traped when she is, enjoy the thrill that Will causes her, been condused with the dead-ends that she has to face. And that is something exceptional. To be able to be one with the hero, share her thoughts, feelings and decisions. Live the story yourself! Firelight is definately a must-read!I'm sure it will capture all of you and excite you to the core!",amalia

9781595143426,"My first thought when finishing this book was along the lines of ""Wow, so much better than I expected!"". Tory is the niece of my beloved Tempe (from Bones) and she's a little mini-version of her. So smart, and so young that it blows your mind. Tory and her crew of friends are all smart in their own areas, and I loved following the adventures of this nerd herd! They live on a remote island, so they really have to come up with their own fun. Tory is obsessed with a pack of wolf-dogs on a remote island, but the pup has been missing. When they break into the lab to clean an old war dog-tag they found they also discover the missing puppy and just can't leave it behind. The mystery of the dog-tag becomes quite an adventure, and saving that puppy will lead them on a path they never could have imagined. I was so engrossed in this book. I would think I'd been reading for only a few minutes, then I would look up and realize it's been much longer and I'm 1/2 way through the book! The mysteries unfold at a great pace and the action just explodes off of the page. I was drawn into the lives of these kids and didn't want to reemerge. Tory is super smart and so snarky and wonderful, I would have loved to have a best friend like her when I was in high school (even though I would have felt dumb hanging around her). The best friends each have their own qualities that make them a great team and each of them add a great element to the story. Chance (the uber-jock, son of a senator, prince of the school) and his girlfriend Hannah really added a great twist to the story. I really recommend this book to any lover of mysteries, Bones, fantasy, or YA. I can't wait for book 2 and where this series can go from here. I also loved that the mystery of this book wrapped up completely by the end. There was no cliff-hanger to leave me ready to throw the book, but the next book could go in so many directions still. I only wish I didn't have to wait so long!",Reading Angel
9781595143426,"Tory and her father live on an island reserved for the faculty who work at the remote research facility on a nearby island. She and her friends often explore the research island. One day, she convinces them to break into the facility to use their equipment in rejuvenating a dog tag ID they found in the woods. While they have no problems cleaning the dog tags, they discover a missing wild puppy locked in a cage. Outraged, they immediately break Coop out and hide him in their secret cavern. Tory and her friends take turns caring for the puppy while also trying to unravel the mystery surrounding the dog tags. They search the library, where they uncover clues to the identity of the man. Unfortunately, their search triggers a reaction. Someone doesn't want that information uncovered, and they'll do almost anything to keep Tory and her friends from learning and sharing the truth. Coop is sick, sick with a strand of virus that infects Tory and her friends. Suddenly, they're having hot flashes, blacking out, and using bursts of adrenaline to execute inhuman feats. These feats occur in times of extreme danger - being followed, chased, shot at, or while breaking into secure buildings. VIRALS is Kathy Reichs' first foray into the young adult world, and she knocks it out of the park. After a slow start, the tension, drama, danger, mystery, and the strange virus pulsing through the characters' bodies make this book extraordinarily hard to put down. I'm already waiting for the next book in the series. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

Although the young beetle and his relatives try to help the Pompadays in little tasks, like fixing the thermostat and retrieving a lost contact lens, they know all too well the danger that exists for them simply by being beetles in the world of humans. Marvin, however, feels a kinship with James Pompaday, and he is determined to find a satisfactory present for the boy's eleventh birthday, especially since the rest of the boy's day ended up such a disappointment. For James - whose ambitious mother invited the children of clients as his guests and whose artist father showed up for only a few moments near the end to deliver an ink-and-pen set as a present, when James has no interest in art - his birthday ended up exactly as he had known it would. As the oldest son in a blended family, he often finds himself passed over and ignored. All of that changes thanks to Marvin. While delivering the beetles' gift of a buffalo nickel, Marvin, on a whim, draws a teeny, tiny picture of the view from James's bedroom window with the ink that James received from his father. When James awakens and discovers the tiny beetle's masterpiece, Marvin takes a chance and reveals himself to the boy. Astounded, James realizes that the work is Marvin's, and although the two can't speak or communicate, their bond of friendship will take them through a mystery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The adults, under the impression that the tiny drawing is the work of James, ask the boy to copy a famous work by artist Albrecht Drer. One of a set of four, the rest of the collection has disappeared at the hands of an art thief, and, with a plan to have James's forgery stolen instead, they hope to recover the rest of the stolen art. However, Marvin is the real artist, and his parents forbid him to get involved. It is up to Marvin to decide how important his friendship with James is, and how important art is to him. Chock-full of artful conversations and historical tidbits regarding the Renaissance era, MASTERPIECE is a masterpiece that blends several storylines and character motivations into a wonderfully deep work. Fans of ""small world"" stories, such as THE CRICKET IN TIMES SQUARE and THE BORROWERS, will delight in Marvin's relationships with the complicated worlds around him, and how he manages to cross the line to affect both for the better.",TeensReadToo

9781416927853,"If you went to Vermont, back in the time of the late 1700s... you would meet Justin Morgan. He was a man who had a problem. It all started because a farmer owed Justin some money. The farmer couldn't pay the debt, so instead, he gave a horse. To some people, that would be a wonderful thing to receive, but Justin didn't need a horse. He needed money. One might say, ""Sell the horse""--but that's just the problem. No one wants to use their money on a small, (VERY small), scrawny animal, who is weak and cannot work like other horses. Since no one will buy poor Little Bub, Justin is indeed stuck with him. See what can happen that turns this story upside-down when Justin Morgan's friend decides to help out. Why, even President Monroe takes notice! This book tells a true story. I liked the book because while I was reading it, I knew that it actually happened. In fact, Little Bub's tale became an American legend. This is a delightful horse story, great for boys & girls to read (ages 9 and up).",Tarissa

9781442430488,"I picked up this book as a part of the Magnificently Magic Read-A-Thon* both because it was a book I had been wanting to read and because of how perfectly it fit the criteria. Being as it weighs in at 228 pages and is assuredly lower middle grade might have had something to do with choosing it. Nicholas St. North and the Battle of the Nightmare King is the first book in The Guardians series. It takes place after The Man in the Moon, which is the first book in the picture book companion series, The Guardians of Childhood, also written by William Joyce. (It's a quick read, and I recommend that you read it first.) The Nightmare King, Pitch, escapes his imprisonment after the inadvertent actions of a moonbeam releases an elfish boy made of light encased in a dagger in Pitch's heart. This sets of a chain of events that is the focus of this. I'm not sure if I've ever said this on the blog, but I have a special place in my heart for middle grade novels. There is rarely any gore, minimal depressive events (before you say anything, I believe Harry Potter 5-7 is YA), and a lovely, magical sense of fun whether there is literal magic or not. Nicholas St. North gives us just that. Joyce & Geringer brilliantly draw the reader into the story, while setting up the world in the novel for the entire series. Where the picture book, The Man in the Moon introduced the reader to Mim, AKA Tsar Lunar, in this novel we meet Nicholas St. North (Santa, perhaps?), Ombric the Wizard, and Katherine, a little foundling girl in Ombric's care. Nightlight, a character and friend of Mim's in The Man in the Moon, makes a reappearance in this novel. The first half of the story is mostly devoted to world-building (which is rich), but the action is exciting once it comes. This would be a fantastic story for fans of fairy tales or reimaginings, and I highly recommend this book for reluctant readers. There are illustrations scattered throughout the book, and the pacing is gripping and fast enough to hold on to those frustratingly short attention spans. There is also the film adaptation, The Rise of the Guardians, that can be used as a tool to bring readers to Nicholas St. North and the Battle of the Nightmare King and vice versa. 3.5 Stars",Kayla Beck
9781442430488,"Not since ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" have I read a children's fantasy aimed at the 7-11 crowd that is so engaging, quality literature with awesome illustrations to bring the story to life. This book is not genre specific as it mixes fantasy, science fiction, steampunk, and fairytale retelling all together until one can't really categorize it. It takes place on our Earth and yet includes creatures from Atlantis and the Moon. As I was reading I often had a feeling of L. Frank Baum's writing style; the book looks and has a voice similar to a 19th/early 20th century children's fantasy, chapters have titles such as "" In Which a Twist of Fate Begets a Knot in the Plan"" and ""Where the Impossible Occurs with Surprising Regularity"". The text is large and double-spaced with frequent illustrations so is much shorter than the page numbers would indicate and this does make character development suffer. One never really gets a full sense or deep caring for the characters but I did find the little girl Katharine to be the most fleshed out character and the one I cared for the most. The book ends with the story arc being concluded and yet the overarching story of the series has only just begun, thus it very much has a first in a series feel. However, to clear a little confusion. This is not the first book in the series, even though it is called Book 1. This is a direct sequel to ""The Man in the Moon"" which is confusingly listed as ""The Guardians of Childhood, Book 1"". The Man in the Moon is a picture book but characters and events from the book are present and crucial to the story in ""Nicholas St. North"", so do read it first. Those over 11 may find the book lacking in depth, plot development and characterization as this is not a heavy or detailed read. What it is though, is a fun, whimsical, outlandish fantasy crossed with other genres written to especially appeal to the 7-11 age group and those adults willing to be a kid again. I'm impressed and eager for the next book which will feature the Easter Bunny (excuse me, E. Aster Bunnymund).",Nicola Mansfield

9780061935091,"I have wanted to read this for ages now, because I have watched the beautiful covers for years and wanted to read about the girl who shifted into a draki, a dragon. So, I finally found the ebook at my library and had a bit to read it, so jumped at the chance. I connected with Jacinda and liked being immersed into her world. She is energized by the mists and water from the earth, and she is a part of a tribe. But her mom doesn't shift anymore and her twin sister never transformed, so she feels like a bit of a loner even in her own family. She loves them a lot but their priorities and the way they perceive draki, the tribe, and their hidden existence has a huge gap. When Jacinda breaks a huge rule, her mom pulls them into the regular world and Tam, her sister couldn't be happier joining a new school and being away from the draki culture. But Jacinda hates the desert, it makes her uncomfortable, and hard to maintain her shifts there. But at school she meets the boy, the hunter that didn't kill her for some unexplicable reason and she feels amazing around him. She is trying to hide as a human in the regular world but her skin changes and she feels fire in her chest. The draki in this story all fall into different talents and she is the only fire breather, which made her special in her tribe, but also a commodity. I enjoyed the chemistry and the build up between Will and Jacinda. Its a case of forbidden love, because he is a hunter and she is the prey. But there is something different about Will. She learns things about him that shocks her and maybe makes sense with some of his differences from his family and the draw between Jacinda and him. So, Tamra and Jacinda's mom. In some aspects I enjoyed the family dynamics and that even though Jacinda didn't understand that her mom is acting in her best interest. No matter how painful or against it Jacinda is. There were also times that I didn't like Tamra much. She seemed so selfish at times and mean to Jacinda, with unrealistic expectations. But the story is also through Jacinda's eyes, so we're biased. But I can also take a step back and imagine how Tam would feel. For most of her life she has been the outsider, the one who didn't fit in because she didn't manifest, and had to watch Jacinda be fawned over and such a big deal while I am sure she felt like a failure. The twists towards the end as well as things revealed about the pride and their intentions were pretty shocking. I also couldn't quite figure out Cassian and whether he was truly a faker or if there was a bit more beneath the surface. I will be continuing with this series and can't wait to find out what is next with the draki, Jacinda and Will, and how they will make everything wrap up with an HEA. Bottom Line: Great premise, intense forbidden romance and great start to the series.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780061935091,"I never paid much attention to dragons or dragon-like creatures, only detected them as secondary characters, until Firelight. Jordan introduces the species of draki, the dragon at heart, human on the outside. The very different types of draki fascinate me, from water to fire, onyx and many more. Jordan's got a detailed writing style, still I couldn't properly imagine how a draki really looks like. Jacinda, our protagonist has got a twin who plays an interesting role. They've known each other for their whole lives, have been friends till the time one of them changed and the other didn't. Sophie Jordan invented many different characters, drakis, humans and dragon hunters. So we can explore a wide network of relationships and have to expect many variations and interactions in Firelight's sequel. A love story emerges between prey and Will, the predator, it's sweet and dangerous at the same time. We got many kisses, many planned or coincidental meetings just the way I like them. Annoying about Jacinda is her way of arguing. She revised the same reasoning why she can or can't be near Will felt one thousand times. It's her nature as a draki that makes me like her, but her character is not the most appealing. The only aspect that makes me want to be Jacinda is her connection to Will, who is adorable. Will is supposed to fight drakis and with that fight what Jacinda truly is. At the same time he, as the most dangerous possible threat, prevents her spirit from dying. What's new to this novel is that her supposed enemy revives Jacinda while her family, the ones who are supposed to protect and accept her the way she is, wants her draki to die. Jordan reverses the roles of enemy and family which is very uncommon and adds one more conflict to the great list of possible threats and struggles. Although Firelight felt like only an average read, its end drew me in and left me hanging. I really want to know how Jacinda's story continues and how Jordan intends to solve the overall conflict between drakis and dragon hunters. Hope I can get my hands on a Vanish copy soon. THE VERDICT I give it 3,5/5 stars. I recommend Firelight to every fantasy fan. This novel is represented by a solid writing and expandable character portraits.

9780140310108,"A lot of animals live on Rabbit Hill in rural Connecticut outside of Danbury. They include Father and Mother Rabbit, their son little Georgie, Porkey the Woodchuck, the Gray Fox, the Gray Squirrel, Willie Fieldmouse, Mole, Phewie the Skunk, the Red Buck, and many others. Over three years ago, good Folks lived in the house, the lawns were thick, the fields were covered with clover, and the gardens were full of vegetables. Then evil days fell on the Hill when the good Folks moved away and their successors were mean, shiftless, and inconsiderate. Last autumn, even they left, and the house had stood empty since then. However, now little Georgie comes running with some good news. ""New Folks Coming!"" He even makes up a song about it to sing while going up Danbury way to fetch Uncle Analdas. But will the New Folks be planting people who will provide a good garden that will bring better times to the Hill, or will they have guns and traps and poisons with vicious dogs and nasty cats? And when little Georgie gets hit on the Black Road by a car, what will the New Folks do? This delightful story for younger readers won the Newbery Medal in 1945. Uncle Analdas uses some ""countrified"" euphemisms such as ""tarnation,"" ""gumdinged,"" and especially ""dingblasted."" Also there are a few occurrences of pipe smoking and one reference to elderflower wine. I can understand how some modern kids whose highest notion of ""good reading"" is junk like Harry Potter or A Series of Unfortunate Events would find Rabbit Hill ""boring."" However, for those who like to savor truly fine children's literature with charming characterizations and lovely illustrations, it is a heart-warming and beautiful tale that deserved the Newbery Award. Of course, that was back in the days before the leftists took over the American Library Association. One person noted that the book, apparently based upon the actual hill on which author Robert Lawson lived, is ""a powerful reminder that we are stewards of God's creation,"" and another pointed out the clear message about being kind to our fellow creatures.",Wayne S.

9780618128099,"It is the year 1290 and eleven-soon-to-be-twelve-year-old Walter Tell lives happily in the remote heights of the Swiss Alpine Mountains near the village of Burglen with his father William, who is known as the greatest bowman in the canton of Uri and perhaps even in the nearby cantons of Schwys and Underwalden, his mother Hedwig, his little brother Rudi, and their herd dog Prinz. Nearby also live their friend Marie the herd girl, Brother Klaus the monk, and Grandfather Furst. King Albrecht is the new ruler of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, but unlike his late good father Rudolph he sends cruel bailiffs like Gessler to live at nearby Altdorf and oppress the people. William Tell is one of 33 men who have met secretly at Rootli to formulate a plan to secure their freedom at the beginning of 1291. But it appears that Gessler suspects something. I suppose that nearly everyone has heard the story of how William and Walter go to Altdorf to sell furs. Tell refuses to bow down to Gessler's cap which has been put on a pole in the middle of the town. Gessler is so angry that he punishes Tell by commanding him to shoot an apple off the head of his son. If he misses, both will die. But do you know ""the rest of the story""? The legend of William Tell has survived for more than 700 years. Exactly how much of it is true and how much is fiction perhaps no one knows. But it is certainly a stirring account that resonates in the hearts of all people who love freedom and oppose tyranny. Told simply and well with a good eye for detail and setting from the viewpoint of young Walter, The Apple and the Arrow, which won a Newbery Honor Award in 1952, was first recommended to me in the catalogue of Love to Learn, a homeschool resource center. One reference to drinking wine occurs, but there is a great deal of emphasis on looking to God for guidance and trusting in Him. With its serious themes of independence and responsibility, it will appeal to both children, especially boys, and their parents. Conrad Buff was born in Switzerland in 1886, studied art in his native country and Germany, them emigrated to the United States in 1904, settling in Los Angeles, where he became a noted landscape artist. Along with his wife Mary, he coauthored and illustrated a number of children's books.

But in the first hour, she loses control of her frightened horse - causing an accidental spill. In doing so, she made her first enemy. Luckily, Sasha adores her roommate, Paige, who isn't involved in the equestrian side of school. Canterwood Crest is a huge step up from her previous riding experiences. Sasha hopes that she can live up to the school's reputation and her riding instructor's expectations. After her first day, it's clear that Sasha can handle the riding portion of school. However, Heather's not used to sharing the spotlight. She senses competition from Sasha and it becomes her personal mission to take Sasha down. Sasha never dreamed she'd have to deal with mean girls on top of challenging classes, long riding lessons, and competing to make the advance riding team. She's determined to come out on top, but first she has to go through Heather. This series is THE SADDLE CLUB meets THE CLIQUE in a seriously fun and addicting read. Sasha could be your best friend: she's smart but relaxing and knows how to have a good time. Plus, she's determined and can hold her own against Heather. While Sasha might not always like Heather (or her comments); she can sympathize with her. She's a great character who shows depth and wisdom. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

Finally Spencer's mom has had enough, and after a litigious negotiation, she helps Spencer pack a box of toys to give away. At the last minute, though, Spencer reconsiders the plan in unexpected ways. Shannon's illustrations are cacophonous explotions; even the title page is so chaotic that the text is crowded into the corner. Shannon's fans will recognize elements of his previous characters-Alice the Fairy's expressive aspect; David's corn teeth-in this current cast, portrayed with ebullient vigor. Also effective are the almost surreal backdrops to some of the disagreements. When Spencer is asked to let go of some of his treasures, for example, he resembles a sad-eyed puppy, standing in a gray wasteland, a barren tree in the background. Shannon's story carries an attitude large enough to entertain a big group, while the illustrations are detailed enough to engage even the most inattentive individual when viewed up close.

9780441016433,"For his entire life, Jacob Mendoza has lived in Smokehill National Park, one of the last and largest wildlife preserves for Draco australiensis in the world. His father, who heads the Institute dedicated to the study of the endangered dragons, has kept a tight leash on him since Jacob's mother died while on sabbatical a few years ago. Finally, though, Jacob's father has agreed to let him finally go on his first solo overnight stay deep in the park. Although not as excited as he probably would have been about it before his mother's death, Jacob hikes out on his own, determined to cover some good ground before he has to meet up with the head Ranger the following morning. However, his plans for doing so are cut short when he comes across a horrific site. A wounded mother dragon who has just given birth lies next to the remains of the poacher who presumably attacked her. Jacob creeps up to the massive creature and finds himself drowning in her eyes before she dies, leaving him with strange sensations of anger, despair, and hope swirling inside him. Stunned and crying, he begins to stumble away, passing by her babies who are now scattered on the ground...and he notices that one is still alive. Instinct takes over, and Jacob now finds himself a surrogate mother for a creature that nobody knows how to raise. What's worse is that, now that a dragon has killed a human, all of Smokehill may be gravely in danger, for, not only is it against the law to kill a dragon, but it is also against the law to save one's life. Although I enjoyed watching the bonding of Jacob and his foundling, and the descriptions of some of these otherworldly sensations impressed me, I found this book very difficult to read. Jacob as narrator tends to ramble a lot, and he ""speaks"" in an extremely informal manner. However, some readers may find this style more appealing and easier to understand than traditional narration. The idea of a dragon preserve is nevertheless an appealing one, and I think that any fans of dragons may find this story fascinating if for that reason only.",TeensReadToo

Griffin and his friends (if you've read SWINDLE by Mr. Korman, these are the same kids that managed to pull off the baseball card caper) are on a class field trip to the traveling exhibit All Aboard Animals. An old paddleboat has been converted into a traveling zoo. The kids are grossed out by the stench of the animals, and when Savannah finds Cleo in a cage marked Eleanor, she is absolutely livid. She demands her monkey back, but the zookeeper, Mr. Nastase, insists he bought her legally and has a bill of sale to prove it. The kids, grumbling, leave the floating zoo, but Savannah is determined to get Cleo back. It's Griffin who comes up with the idea: Zoobreak. He assembles a team of friends, each with a specific job, and comes up with the plan. The kids successfully (though with some hiccups in the execution) retrieve Cleo, along with all the other animals in the exhibit. If they had left the other animals, they'd have been home free. But Savannah can't stand the thought of leaving the rest of the animals in such squalid conditions. Trying to conceal such exotic animals as a meerkat, loon, beaver and more create havoc in the kids' lives. They realize they have to get rid of the animals before they are found out. Their only option is to break the animals INTO another zoo. If you think this is as crazy as it sounds, it is! The adventures Griffin and his friends get into are hysterical. The fact that the plans actually work are astounding. But of course, there are obstacles along the way, and it's navigating the obstacles that are the most fun.

This book tells the story of Sam who does not doubt his abilities but instead writes mouse-sized books and places them around the library he lives in.

The story continues on from Book One which ended happily but left a quest unfulfilled. All our old friends are back again as they search for the second artifact and it is this journey which leads them to Bunnymund and his steampunk world of egg-shaped machines. A delight to read, this book (and series) is especially aimed at that special age of 7-11. As I've remarked before, not since the Spiderwick Chronicles have I been so taken with the whimsy of a fantastical setting and story.

While Wendell's costume is an hydrogen atom, Christiana's is a salmonella bacteria and Christiana talks science using words even Wendell has to look up in a dictionary.

In the middle of June, one of their hens starts looking pretty queer and gets so big that she could hardly waddle. Later she lays the biggest egg that Nate had ever seen. It has a leathery shell and is as big as a mushmelon, measuring fifteen inches around and weighing three pounds and a quarter. What do you think finally hatches out of that egg one Sunday morning? Well, it isn't a chicken. It is a dinosaur called Triceratops. As luck would have it, Dr. Oscar Ziemer, a paleontologist with the National Museum in Washington, DC, just happens to be vacationing in the area, staying with the MacPhersons down at the nearby lake, and has heard about the egg, so he asks to be notified when it hatches. Nate names the dinosaur Uncle Beazley, after his mom's great-uncle John Beazley. The Triceratops begins to eat and grow-and eat and grow-and eat and grow, until most of the available grass in the whole neighborhood is gone. What will the Twitchells do, especially when the weather gets too cold for a dinosaur? Dr. Ziemer suggests sending it to the National Museum in Washington. But with the change from the quiet country to the busy city, what will happen to Uncle Beazley? I started liking this book as soon as I began reading it. Aside from a few common euphemisms (darn, gosh, golly, and gee), one use of the exclamation ""My Lord,"" and some references to tobacco use and a brand of whisky, the biggest objection that might be lodged against it is the evolutionary presuppositions undergirding the story. There are copious mentions of ""millions of years ago."" While we creationists reject this hypothesized scenario, the vast majority of the world accepts it, and the book is fiction anyway, so with that understanding one can still enjoy the story. I did notice a couple of things about the book that I appreciated. Nate is told in no uncertain terms when he asks if they still have to go to church on the morning when the egg hatches that ""there's no reason to give up going to church just because we've got a dinosaur out back."" And the way Senator Granderson is pictured as wanting to get the federal government involved in nearly every aspect of our individual lives is certainly true to form.",Wayne S. Walker

The old woman decided that they needed a cat, so the old man set out to find one. Finally, he came to a hill which was covered with ""Cats here, cats there, cats and kittens everywhere, hundreds of cats, thousands of cats, millions and billions and trillions of cats."" He never could decide which one to choose, so he brought them all home. However, the old woman knew that they could never feed them all, so they determine to keep only the prettiest one. But how will they decide which one is prettiest? And what will happen to all the others? This enchanting tale was a recipient of the 1929 Newbery Honor Book Award. It has been said that it is a wonderful story of vanity versus humility. Gag's simple yet appealing black ink drawings are perfect illustrations of the plot and are able to capture the idea of millions of cats on a single page. We are a cat-loving family, and our experience confirms the nature of cats as described by Gag. By modern standards, it is basically a picture book. In fact, many children's literature historians consider Millions of Cats to be the origin of the modern picture book. The Caldecott Medal was created in the late 1930's, in part to recognize books such as this. A couple of reviewers did not like it because the million cats eat each other in a battle over who is the prettiest and because it raised too many questions about why all the cats were fighting and what happened to the other cats. Actually, the old man and woman just assumed that the cats must have eaten each other. They could have fought and then just run away. On the other hand, most people who have reviewed the book said that they enjoyed it. Other books by Gag include The ABC Bunny, also a Newbery Honor winner (1934); The Funny Thing; Gone Is Gone: or the Story of a Man Who Wanted to Do Housework; and Snippy And Snappy.

While the latter series is for established, and perhaps reluctant readers, this new series is for emergent or reluctant readers. All six books in the series are at a GR. 2 level with this one being at a RL:2.8. Following the same format as the established series, DC Super Pets uses colourful cartoon graphics for all the sound effect words. It goes on to make the books more appealing to younger readers by using different colours of text for each character's spoken words. There are also illustrations on every page, using a variety of formats from full-page to half-page to single illustrations amongst the text. This may sound crowded at first but the lines of text are double spaced creating a nice graphic display, easily read on each page. We've now read all six books in this new series. Ds asked if there were any more and I had to tell him this was all there was for now. He's really enjoyed reading this series and it has stretched his reading capabilities.

THE UNDERNEATH is lyrical, strong, and extremely well-written. It is thought provoking and ""can't put it down"" fantastic. Kathy Appelt does not lower the bar in the slightest from page one until the book is done. Not one bit. Appelt weaves a brilliant tale about an old, beaten-down hound dog and the felines he loves. She also weaves an almost entirely separate folktale of a miserable, bitter, shape-shifting snake. How do these two stories fit into the same book? Ask Kathi Appelt, because I'm still trying to figure out how she beautifully intertwined them. But she did. She did. In the acknowledgements, Appelt mentions advice from M.T. Anderson (THE ASTONISHING LIFE OF OCTAVIAN NOTHING) that she took to heart: ""Write what you think you can't.""

The book actually involves a mystery that is solvable by the reader if they pay attention to the clues given out along the way. Danny and Wendell have become bonafide complete characters with their background stories built up over the last several volumes to create two very good, but opposite best friends. The reader can count on how each will act in certain situations and we know their strengths and weaknesses, but also knowing, more than they do, that their friendship is stronger than the sum of their parts, proving they can overcome obstacles for each other. This strong friendship, at this time in the series, welcomes the addition of Christiana as a third member of the team, having met her in the last book. Her character is given some good development to allow some interplay between both Danny and Wendell as well as a bit of a background story. We are also, once again, introduced to a new relative of Danny's only this time it is a younger cousin, but it does bring back the recurring theme of the previous books where Danny visits a relative, only this time the relative visits him. A solid plot and a good story, though lacking a little in the humour department. I didn't find this one near as funny as the others, perhaps because it was more serious when the antagonists are adults (mind you, still animals) and the victims are cute animals, even if they are mythological jackalopes. There were funny scenes and lines but on the whole more of an adventurous frolic than the simple humorous story of the previous volumes. A solid entry in the series.",Nicola Mansfield

Seeing as how her last pet-owning experiences haven't turned out so well, though, mom isn't having any of her pleas and begging. Sure, you could feel sorry for Babymouse, but you have to admit that the belly-up goldfish, escaped hamster, runaway turtle, disappearing ferret (need I go on with the salamander, hermit crabs, Venus Flytraps, or sea monkeys?) have mom worried about her ability to take care of a dog. But Babymouse, being Babymouse, has big plans for this dog that she'll have, which will include proper care, feeding, walking, and grooming. Perhaps a dog show. When she finds a stray dog without a collar, it's love at first sight! Even though the dog doesn't any of the names she picks out for it and can't seem to behave for even a minute, Babymouse just knows this mouse-dog relationship is meant to be. Or is it? As always, this eighth adventure starring Babymouse is another winner. You can't help but love her, even when her schemes go wrong, or her hilarious daydreams take a turn for the worse. Sister/brother team Jennifer L. and Matthew Holm have got Babymouse down to a science, and I for one can't wait to see what she comes up with next!",TeensReadToo

She wants a dog and she wants one bad. Her best friend, Mimi, also wants a dog. They decide that Grace has a better chance of getting one, so when Grace does get a dog, they plan on sharing it. Of course, it's not easy convincing Grace's parents that she's responsible enough to have a dog -- and there's also the fact that Grace and Mimi can't decide on what type of dog to get. It turns out that getting a dog is harder than Grace expected. JUST GRACE WALKS THE DOG is a great addition to the humorous JUST GRACE series. Harper does a great job of capturing the voice of a young tween.

9780547248196,"Theodosia Throckmorton, precocious daughter of a London museum curator and a top archaeologist, is back again in this sequel to THEODOSIA AND THE SERPENTS OF CHAOS. In that previous volume, eleven-year-old Theo used her knowledge of Egyptian curses to keep her parents safe from the dangerous artifacts that they handle on a daily basis, but in doing so, she ran afoul of a secret organization known as the Serpents of Chaos, whose goal, as their name implies, is to destroy order and plunge the world into violence. Now, the Serpents are back, trying again to use their knowledge of Egyptian lore and curses to encourage the tensions building between Victorian England and Kaiser Wilhelm's Germany. Theo may be just one girl, but she's got the backing of an entire museum worth of information and newfound friends to help her figure out the latest mystery. When she's assigned to clean out and catalogue the museum's basement, she comes across an artifact with more power than she suspected--the Staff of Osiris, which, when properly wielded, can reanimate and attract the dead toward it. Unfortunately, Theo's accidental activation of the staff leads all the mummies of London to make their way through the streets to her father's museum, leading the police to suspect Theo's father of stealing them. Theo must work to clear her father's name and keep the staff safe from the Serpents of Chaos, who wish to employ it for its more diabolical ability to produce a poisonous gas that will kill anyone who breathes it. I thoroughly enjoyed this second story of Theodosia's. LaFevers wittily mixes serious historical ramifications with comical moments. Even at its most serious, the story finds a lighthearted core in Theo's first-person narration, which continues to be a wonderful vehicle for exploring early 1900s London. It's quite possible that I enjoyed this book better than the first one, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in magic and adventure!",TeensReadToo

9780547334004,"It is around the turn of the twentieth century, and sixteen-year-old Ramon Salazar lives in the town of La Paz on the Baja California coast of Mexico, with his father Blas, the owner of a lucrative pearl fishing business, mother, and two sisters. Blas Salazar had promised his son that when he turned sixteen he would make Ramon a partner in his business, allow him to sail with the fleet, and teach him how to dive for pearls. However, following his birthday Ramon gets to go only once, staying on the boat, and afterwards is left home to work in the shop because his father is afraid of losing his only son to the sea. So Ramon makes a secret arrangement with an Indian diver named Soto Luzon to learn how to dive for pearls from him while his father's fleet is out. One of Senor Salazar's divers, Gaspar Ruiz, a young man who is called the Sevillano because he came from Seville, Spain, claims to have found a giant pearl the size of a hen's egg in the Gulf of Persia which he sold to the Shah for a lot of money. Also, in the Vermilion Sea off the shores of La Paz, there is a giant ray known as the Manta Diablo, stories of which mothers in La Paz used to frighten their children into obedience. Soto Luzon says that the Manta Diablo lives in and guards the lagoon near his house, so Ramon goes there to dive and finds The Pearl of Heaven. When Senor Salazar is not offered enough money for it, he gives it to the church. But after the Salazar fleet is destroyed in a storm and everyone, including Ramon's father, is lost, except for the Sevillano who manages to escape, Ramon finds that the pearl has brought him two enemies-the Manta Diablo and the Sevillano. Then the pearl is stolen. Who took it? And what will happen to Ramon? Author Scott O'Dell has written some great books. We liked Island of the Blue Dolphins, although we did not care for its sequel Zia quite as well, and we really liked The Hawk That Dare Not Hunt by Day about William Tyndale. I wonder if O'Dell based The Black Pearl on the same Mexican legend that John Steinbeck used for his book The Pearl. It is an interesting adventure-type story with a touch of suspense that has little objectionable. The Spanish phrase ""Madre de Dios,"" which means ""Mother of God,"" is used a couple of times as an exclamation, which I understand is fairly common in Mexico. As one might expect, there are several Roman Catholic beliefs and practices mentioned, with which those of us who are Protestants would not agree. In fact, one person suggested, ""Treatment of the Madonna by the people could be impetus for a paper on the theology errors in the book."" However, I choose to look upon these things as simply O'Dell's depiction of the religious customs of the people in a historical fiction setting. It won a Newbery Honor in 1968. Another individual said that it contains ""elements of The Old Man and the Sea and Moby Dick"" and is a ""heavily symbolic tale about evil, art, the artist, greed and nature.""",Wayne S. Walker

9780394875798,"This introduction to the Arthurian legends for children before they can manage Howard Pyle or Sir Thomas Malory's editions contains short chapters which tell about the sword in the stone, Lancelot and the fiery-mouthed dragon, the beautiful witch Morgan Le Fay with her scheme to usurp the throne, Sir Gawain's marriage to the ugly Ragnall to save Arthur, the kitchen knight known as ""Big Hands"" who rescues the Lady Linness, and Mordred's treachery leading to the last battle. Readers are asked to imagine a mythic kingdom in England of wizards and witches, fire-breathing dragons, and dreadful giants. Who can rule this magical land? Who can overcome the powers of evil? It is the destiny of King Arthur and his noble knights, who protect and serve the people of Camelot. In the Preface, the author writes, ""Was there a real King Arthur? People who study the past think there was. They know only a little about him. He ruled in England about fifteen hundred years ago. He won many battles. And he was a king no one could forget."" Of course, what little we know about the real Arthur is quite different from all the legends that grew up around him, but the legends have become part of our English literature and still deserve to be studied. Many of those legends contain a great deal of immorality, such as Guinevere's adultery, which is not appropriate for young children and is thankfully omitted in this book. The simple vocabulary with large print and the gray pencil and charcoal drawings will appeal to early readers. One of the biggest complaints about this book was the bad grammar with a lot of sentence fragments which make the narrative choppy. ""For seven days King Arthur and Sir Gawain rode through the land. They asked the riddle of every woman they met. Young maidens with flowers in their hair. Mothers carrying their babies. Poor women tending sheep by the road. Rich ladies covered with jewels. Some said that women wanted beauty. Some said love. Or wisdom. Or children. Or riches. Or Adventure. Or truth."" I noticed this in reading it aloud. While one wouldn't hold the book up as a model of sentence structure, it could be argued that the stories are written in the same style with which we often speak to express emotion and inflection of voice. The book is apparently available in two editions. Someone suggested that the Bullseye Classics version is without what some see as the horrendous grammatical errors, whereas the Stepping Stone edition is thought by them to be quite poorly written.",Wayne S.

9780920236161,"At first, the story looks like any other fairy tale. There is a princess, a prince and a dragon, typical fairy tale characters; however, this is not your classical fairy tale. Thank god for that. Stories where princesses are waiting to be rescued by charming princes and are so delicate and helpless that they might faint any moment, are really getting old. This one is different, all the pieces of fairy tales are there (big bad dragon, a prince, a princess, a castle, the rescue and cunning) but the way they are put together is something different, something new and fresh. The language is smooth and the characters are well developed. The author managed to create real, picturesque characters with only a few lines. Forget about Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora who get their happy ending not because they are particularly smart or because they had worked hard for it but because they are beautiful, that is all. What an accomplishment. This is not what we want to teach our children. The Paper Bag Princess gives us a real heroine. The main character is strong, clever and independent, a great role model for girls and boys. The story is appropriate for children between ages 3 to 8, but even I as a grown up enjoyed reading the story. I think that has a lot to do with the story itself, characters, wonderful illustrations and humor. Humor is what gives the story that kick, children and adults alike would appreciate it greatly. The story has an interesting and unexpected ending and it makes you say: ""High five."" The story comes to life with the help of expressive illustrations: the snobbish prince, the mean and not very clever dragon and one determined princess. The illustrations are playful with a dose of funny. Nicely done.",Nadja
9780920236161,"Judging by the title, The Paper Bag Princess looks just like another fairy tale princess story about a poor girl who meets a prince and in the end they live happily ever after. However, the real story begins when the reader discovers a unique heroin. The story begins as a picture perfect fairy tale where Elizabeth, a beautiful princess, is about to marry her prince charming but then a dragon comes along and everything changes. Instead of taking the princess, as it happens in any other princess story, the dragon carries Prince Ronald off to his cave. The idea of a strong heroin is what makes this story so powerful. She outsmarts the dragon and saves her prince, while wearing only a paper bag (ironically this is the only thing that didn't get burnt). She doesn't need a horse, an armour and a sword to fight the villain. And just when you think that there will be a usual a??happily ever aftera?? ending, the author adds another twist to the story. Martachenkoa??s amuzing illustrations really create the illusion of a determined princess and a stuck-up prince. I believe that this book is appropriate for all children, regardless of the gender, as it shows that even if a a??dragona?? comes along and takes everything that you care about, you can still make a change and have your own a??happily ever aftera??.",Breda Meza

I wish that this book was around when I was a tween - so witty, entertaining and fun - loved every second I spent with Jade! Jade is your average tween just trying to find the perfect swimsuit for her best friend's pool party... so happy to have found the perfect one, she was not prepared for all that happens afterwards! First period. First crush run-in. Major embarrassing moment with Dad in front of first crush. Could Jade's day get any worse? How 'bout a giant fish-tail??? Yes. It is completely possible for a bad day to get worse. Poor Jade! In less than 24 hours, Jade 'becomes a woman' and finds out that she's half human, half mermaid. And that her mother used to be a mermaid too. Her mother who drowned in the lake last summer. Everything about Jade, her family and friends, her life seemed so realistic. Her attitude, whit and independence made Jade such a strong character that many girls will love and admire. Jade is inspiring, no matter what happened, she dealt with it the best way she could. And I loved that she was so close to her dad and was able to go to him for anything that she needed help with - including the embarrassing trip to the store! Which made their relationship and story so much more realistic and relatable. There were so many laugh-out-loud moments, I was smiling the entire time. And of course, there were moments where my heart went out to Jade - this is an age where a girl really could use a mother figure and she was truly missing her mom so much, there were quite a few tender moments where she needed her so much. Oh, and Jade's crush, Luke. I wasn't sure at first if he was a keeper or not. Still not sure. But Luke's got a few secrets of his own! He's a keeper, for now! Also, the way that the author was able to integrate Jade's transformation from human to mermaid was so natural. Every time it happened it seemed like something normal, something that may actually be able to happen in real life. The changes that Jade went through physically were not simple, but the explanation and details made it seem very believable and mesmerizing. I am really looking forward to watching Jade grow and blossom, and also learning more about Luke and what has happened to Jade's mom in the next book, Real Mermaids Don't Hold Their Breath.",Margarita Cortina

After falling asleep in the bath, she wakes up to discover a mermaid's tail in place of her legs. Jade freaks out, but eventually changes back to human. Soon, her Dad's forced to tell her that her mother used to be a mermaid. His answer raises all kinds of questions, but the most important one is ""If Mom was a mermaid, how did she drown?""

9780142420980,"Review: I love this series. I loved the first book and I loved the second book. The story definitely intensifies in this book. We lost some characters from the first book (no they didn't die just not in this book as much) but we gained a slew of new characters. Quite a bit that I just fell in love with . This installment is full of twists, turns, heartache, action, and lots of history. I loved every moment of it. Long Story Short: The story picks up right where we left off in Nightshade. Calla and Shay have been taken by the Searchers. Calla wakes to find herself in what she would think is a dangerous situation, but what she finds is that the Searchers are far different than she ever imagined. They don't like her much for sure but they need her and she needs them. As her stay continues she learns there is more history that belongs to her people, the searchers, and the keepers, and what she learns changes her world. In the middle of all her history lessons, she starts to miss her pack and even Ren, she is confused and doesn't know which path to take... freedom and the chance to be with Shay or to return to her pack and help those she loves. My Thoughts: This book was so intense. First off, I loved hearing all the history, the beginnings, and the secrets the past holds. I find that if an author does it right, storytelling within a story can be just super fascinating, Andrea Cremer did it more than right! It was pure enjoyment, interesting, and enlightening. Second, I loved that this book took place in a new setting with some new and very lovable characters. An entire new world but still held onto the important elements of the old world. It was crazy awesome to see how the searchers live, what they can do, and where they fit in to the story exactly. If I had to choose a side, it would be with the searchers for sure... unless I could be a wolf with no keeper. The new characters were so different and captivating, they really brought the story up to a new level for me. Last but not least.. I am glad to have back the beautiful writing and superb storytelling from the first book. Everything that made me fall in love with the first book was included in this book. I really missed my time with the wolves while they were away.... I was glad to have them back. The story just keeps getting better, this is for sure not one of those empty filler, middle book, it's another stepping stone in Calla and Shay's story. The twists are there, the love, joy, devastation were there (Andrea Cremer is not afraid to make me cry) and the action packed scenes were there all wrapped up in beautiful words.

Although oblivious at first, Harold begins to worry that something is wrong with Bunnicula. Could he be sick? Chester knows for certain that it has nothing to do with being sick; he is set on Bunnicula acting this way because he wants to cause trouble. Chester saw what Bunnicula had done before... sucking up all of the juices from the vegetables! Of course, Chester doesn't want Bunnicula to strike again, so his infamous plans are put into action. On the side, the Monroe family is trying to save the movie theater, where they found Bunnicula, from being torn down, since it's a landmark in Centerville. Ironically, though, the last movie they will be playing is Dracula. Could this possibly have anything to do with why Bunnicula is acting weird? It's up to Harold and Howie to crack the case, and to make sure Chester doesn't go too far -- or it just might be the end! BUNNICULA STRIKES AGAIN! is a very entertaining sequel to the hit BUNNICULA. Once again, Harold writes and narrates the story, making the tale even more humorous. Fans of the first book will definitely want to sink their teeth into this one, especially if they want to know what Bunnicula and even Chester are up to now.",TeensReadToo
9781416906384,"This book tells the story of a Vietnam hero. It's not your usual run-of-the-mill war story because it's told from two points of view. A young soldier named Rick Hanski and a German shepherd he trained for the military share the spotlight as they recount their adventures from training camp to active duty in the jungles of Vietnam. Cracker and Rick are paired together in training to sniff out bombs, booby-traps, and enemy soldiers. Neither one is too sure of the other at first, but they eventually become inseparable friends and soldiers. Rick's goal is to prove his worth and ""whip the world,"" and Cracker is by his side throughout the experience. Cynthia Kadohata gives the reader detailed descriptions of the dog training process, as well as a view of the dog handler/animal relationship. The scenes set in Vietnam provide a close-encounter type look that makes the reader feel part of the action. CRACKER! is a book for anyone with a love and respect for the intelligence of animals and an interest in how they can interact with and serve humanity. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

The artwork is so cute and the animals have such personalities it was a joy to read. Elementaries are going to love this series. Sasspants PI inadvertently gets mistaken for a detective and the hamsters call on him to solve the case of the missing sandwiches. Every day the owner puts a sandwich near the hamster cage for his lunch and every day it disappears. He has said if it happens one more time he is going to get rid of them once and for all. Only the hamsters don't know what is happening as they can't stay awake and Sasspants takes the case to get the annoying hamster off his back. The owner is somewhat addlepated, having labeled the animal cages with all the wrong names: the hamsters are koalas, the mice are walruses, the chinchillas are camels and so on. But what really makes this so entertaining are the personalities of the animals. Sasspants is a reader who wants to be left alone, a take charge guy just to get everyone off his case. The goldfish are my favourite with their short term memories, they can hardly remember each others names long enough let alone have an intelligent conversation. Then the hamsters who spend most of their time sleeping except the one who has befriended Detective Pants and thinks they have become best buddies, though he does have a tendency to fall asleep frequently and also believes he may still be a koala like the sign says. The last pages include an article on a non-fiction topic relevant to the story, this time explaining how a snake can eat something four times the size of its mouth and a last page telling the differences between what the owner labeled the animals and what they really are.

9781416914730,"Pete, the eldest of the Monroe boys, has won an essay contest for describing why the Fleshcrawlers book series grosses him out the most, and now the author of the series, M.T. Graves, will be visiting his school. What's even more exciting is that, instead of staying at a hotel like he normally would, Mr. Graves has asked to stay with the Monroes, all so he could meet their most unusual pets. The entire family works hard to prepare for their guest, especially Howie the puppy, who is as big a fan of the Fleshcrawlers series as Pete. Chester the cat, however, does not feel as excited about this as everyone else. He's convinced that M.T. Graves has some nasty things in store, since all of his stories involve changing animals into horrible things. Why else would he have made all of these strange requests, like having the vampire bunny, Bunnicula, stay in his room, and dressing-less salad left by his bed at night? Why did he specifically say he wanted to meet the pets? A flock of crows blankets the Monroe house when their strange guest arrives, and it's all downhill from there. Is the author's corvine pet, Edgar Allan Crow, in league with the leader of the flock, and what does M.T. Graves plan to do with Bunnicula? It's up to Chester, Harold, and Howie to stop them and save their friend. I was surprised and sad to find that this is the last planned book in the BUNNICULA series.

My eldest son was quite fond of this author so we've had a lot of his books in the house and I still have some left, but my youngest never took to them. Smasher is a cute book. A bit of a take on the ugly duckling story. This is an easy chapter book as well. Probably good for average 3rd grade readers. This is a realistic story of a ""throwback"" puppy of a litter; he's not weak or a runt. In fact he's the biggest and strongest, but looks nothing like the mother or other pups and is, in the farmer's opinion down right ugly. Smasher truly owns his name by causing all sorts of trouble from chasing chickens and sheep to entering the house, stealing a steak, whizzing in the living room and causing major havoc. Mrs. Farmer has enough and orders the pup begone. In this heart-warming story the kind-hearted farmer has grown too fond of ""Smasher"" to get rid of him so instead secretly spends three months training him. On his first day back to the farm Smasher surprises everyone with a skill no one knew he had. Now he can earn his bread and board as a house dog!

9781404868441,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader. Well ds (and I) really enjoyed this title even more so than usual. This is a very fun story that doesn't follow the usual supervillan plot of the other books in the series. Instead, this time, we have two cyborg salamanders who idolize Professor Zoom, follow him home, find a giant robot and get it working. They then proceed to cause chaos in Central City. Luckily The Flash's pet turtle the Terrific Whatzit is nearby to rescue the day. Ds had a great time reading this one and enjoyed the antics of both Whatzit and the newts. Being autistic he doesn't often get a lot of humour unless it is right in your face but he laughed all the way through at the shenanigans of cyborg newts, X-43 and Bit-Bit. He even got 2 out of the 3 jokes at the back of the book! He usually doesn't get any of them.

9780803735255,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. This is the fourth book in the series and Ms. Vernon is still going strong. I'll say this was not my favourite of the bunch but it is still a worthy entry in the series. Danny and Wendell save a tiny bat from drowning and true to the form that the series ventured from in book three, Danny asks him mom for a relative who can help them save the bat's life. So she sends them off to visit cousin Steve in the rain forests of Mexico as he is conducting research on bats there. Whilst there, the three come upon the existence of a new giant species of bat that kidnaps Danny. Fortunately Steve and Danny get along amazingly well from the beginning because, as Wendell notices, they share the same attitude and humour. This helps carry the story and keep the dynamics rolling along as the reader is used to when Wendell and Steve are partnered up for a good portion of the book searching for Danny. Of course, as expected, the plot is full of action from start to finish in this part text, part graphic novel chapter book. The humour is off-key and as hilarious as ever with Danny/Steve and Wendell's character's being so completely different. Perhaps I've gotten used to the silliness of these stories and that is why this one didn't quite thrill me as much as the last two. Another difference is that this book does manage to add quite a lot of actual scientific information about real bats into the story. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different for a Dragonbreath book. The end of the book warns us that next time Danny will have a ""Haunting"" adventure, which sounds promising as the fifth book will be released in August is called ""No Such Thing As Ghosts"".",Nicola Mansfield

They want to do something different, so they follows the rumors of an empty window, excited to find that the window belongs to the local library. Though they don't get to see inside the library very often, many members of the colony look forward to this rare treat. The older ones rush off to explore the shelves of books, while the little ones romp through the halls, using a projector to make shadow puppets or playing in the water fountain. The adult bats settle the little ones down with a lively story time, until every bat on the premises can imagine themselves in the various worlds of books. After a wonderful evening with Little Red Riding Bat, Make Way for Batlings, and the Velveteen Bat, they see the sun lightening the sky outside the window, and know they must leave. However, they all look forward to the next time a librarian leaves a window open, so they can have another Bat Night at the Library. Smooth rhymes and even more impressive artwork make this second book on the bats of Brian Lies a truly delightful read for anyone, young or old.

He tries to tell his family, but they are all too busy, and no one notices when the pirates pull up in their rowboat and ask Jeremy if they have reached the Spanish Main. When he says no, they are at North Beach, the pirate captain notices Jeremy's sandcastle. They need a good digger, so they invite Jeremy along with them to bury their treasure. Life as a pirate starts out very exciting. Jeremy finds that pirate table manners don't include saying ""please"" or chewing with mouths closed. He doesn't have to eat vegetables (since there aren't any on board), and he even teaches the pirate crew how to play soccer before the ball ends up overboard in a shark's mouth. After a hardy pillow fight, Jeremy heads to bed without brushing his teeth...but he can't sleep. Pirates don't tuck in, or read bedtime stories. And when a terrible storm hits the ship, Jeremy is forgotten in the chaos, and being a pirate isn't much fun anymore. He'll have to do some quick thinking to escape the ship and get back home in time for soccer practice the next day. A hilarious read with goofy, guffaw-inducing illustrations, this whacky tale of a modern boy pirate teaches the important lesson that getting what you wish for is not always best.

It could almost make them wonder if there are any good people left! Yet, we know that there are many good people like carpenters who build the houses in which we live, farmers who grow and cooks who make the food we eat, doctors and midwives who deliver babies, teachers, musicians, and millions and millions of others who help us in various ways by doing very good things, including our moms, dads, sisters, and brothers.

9780899424354,"Reason for Reading: Every Mon-Fri (mostly) we read a Bible story. We converted to Catholicism two Easter Vigils ago and were already in the middle of another Bible Story book at that time. When we finished it we moved onto this one, our first Catholic Bible story book. I'll review this book in particular and then compare how I found it to the usual Protestant or ecumenical Bible story books we had previously read. This is a nice gift Bible with puffy boards and a Presentation page to fill out. Each story is a two-page spread with the left-hand side usually being an illustration and the text on the right-hand side. There is some variety to this though as there are some longer stories where the picture is shrunk to half or a third of the page to make more room for the text and there are scattered throughout some short stories that take up one page with illustration and text sharing the same page. The illustrations are beautiful old-school paintings, very realistic and religious. Mary, Joseph and Jesus are always shown with a halo. Unfortunately no one is credited with the illustrations. The text is a delight to read, presented chronologically and has a suitable reading level for a wide range of ages. I've read many, many Bible story books through the 21 years I've been a mother. How did we find this specifically Catholic Bible story book different from all the others? The beginning and the end to start. This Bible starts with the fall of Lucifer and his ""bad angels"" and ends with the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Earth and the conversion of the first Christians. This Bible also has a definite emphasis on Christ and the Gospels. During the Old Testament, whenever an event or prophesy was made there would be an explanation of how this referred to or was fulfilled in the New Testament. I really appreciated this as it kept us focusing on Christ even during the Old Testament, just like during Mass. The other difference is of course, the Catholic element found in the New Testament where all the Biblical references to the Church are explained and events that are Holy Days are mentioned as such. Also the Eucharist, the Transubstantiation, the Stations of the Cross, the establishment of the Church and the Peter's Primacy are all told from within the Bible stories from whence they came. Thus, I have no problems with reading any Bible story book, Protestant or ecumenical, even as a Catholic, but I do see the advantages of a faith specific Bible story book. Given a choice, though, I would now chose a Catholic Bible story book over another. A lovely Catholic Bible story book, recommended for gift giving.",Nicola Mansfield
9780007519484,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins UK, Children's, and Netgalley.) 18-year-old Tavia recently survived a plane crash that killed 256 other people, and since then she's been living with some distantly related family - Reese and Jay. Tavia doesn't have many friends anymore, apart from a boy that she met at the library - Benson, so when she starts noticing someone following her, he's the person she tells. There's more going on than Tavia realises though, when it suddenly seems that she can make things appear out of thin air, and her relatives may not actually be her relatives. What is really going on? What are the strange triangles Tavia keeps seeing? Who is the man who is stalking her, and who is the man with the sunglasses? Are her relatives really who they say they are? Can she trust Benson? And why can she suddenly create something from nothing? This was an interesting paranormal story, with plenty of twists and turns. It had its dull moments too though. Tavia was an interesting character because of the fact that she had no idea what was going on, but she also didn't really ask enough questions. If I suddenly had strange supernatural powers, I think I might worry more about what was going on than what Tavia actually did. I'm also not sure I'd be quite so quick to trust people as she was. The storyline in this was pretty good. There were loads of twists and turns that I didn't see coming, but at times I did wonder where the story was going. I liked the action that we got at times, but the pace between these action scenes was a bit too slow in comparison, and some parts of the story really seemed to drag. The actual plot did feel a little flimsy in places too, but most of the time I was in the dark as to what was going on, and it was the mystery behind all the crazy stuff that was going on that kept me reading. When certain things were revealed, I was a little unsure as to whether what was going on felt really believable, and I'm still not really sure how solid certain plot points were. The ending really seemed to drag for me, and I'm not sure why as the answers that we got and the action should have made the end really good. There were a lot of answers revealed at the end, including some that I hadn't guessed at, but ultimately the ending was left very open for the next book in the series. I'm a little unsure as to how I really feel about this one overall as there were parts that I liked, and parts that were a bit slow and boring. I think I'll read the next one in the series, but I don't think I'd want to read the books back to back.

As I reviewed this book now, as an adult, I was still amazed that I could hum the tunes to the songs written as poems in the book. FREE TO BE...YOU AND ME is one of those rare gems that have managed to stand the test of time. Updated with vibrant new illustrations, FREE TO BE...YOU AND ME takes controversial messages (imagine how controversial they would have been in the early 1970s!) and brushes off the impossibilities of what can be. FREE TO BE...YOU AND ME emphasizes to children the endless possibilities that are available to them. The book encourages children of all ages to do what they want, and not be limited by what society expect of them. Take the story of ""Atalanta."" The princess's father automatically expects her to marry the man he chooses for her. Atalanta wants nothing to do with that. She wants to be the creator of her own destiny. She compromises with her father that if she can run the race with the possible suitors, if she loses the race, she will do as he wishes. But ultimately, Atalanta holds her own fate in her hands by risking running the race against the suitors. Or, there's ""William's Doll."" What father doesn't cringe at the thought of his son wanting to play with a doll? But this story shows that by allowing William to have the doll that he desires, he has gained the knowledge to be an awesome big brother. These are just two of the wonderful parts of FREE TO BE...YOU AND ME. With poems, comics, songs, and amazing illustrations, parents will fall in love with the book again, and children will immediately make FREE TO BE...YOU AND ME one of those treasures to be read time and again.

9780375847325,"ELSKA is a horse story like no other. Mainly because this story comes straight from the horse's mouth. That's right; Hapka lets Elska tell her own story. The book begins with Elska's birth and follows her as she grows and learns the way of an Icelandic mare. Jump into this book and follow this magnificent horse through training, growing, and even a daring rescue. Reading ELSKA took me back to my childhood when I read horse books by Marguerite Henry. I have to say, I enjoyed Hapka's story as much today as I would have back then . . . maybe more. If you have a horse lover in your life, trot on out and pick up a copy of this book for them. I am passing this book on to my nine-year-old and I'm sure she'll love it. I look forward to future HORSE DIARIES books. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781591473145,"""If you are reading this review you must have a child who worries. When endless amounts of love, understanding and persuading dont make a difference leaving us parents physicaly and mentally exhausted. Don't even hesitate BUY THIS BOOK It will be the best money you have ever spent!! I have never written a review before but after purchasing this book to read with my 10 year old daughter I felt compelled to. It is recomended for 6-12 year olds and is cognative behavoural therapy for kids. If you are not familiar with cognative behavioural therapy it is simply becoming aware of the problem and learning a new way to deal with it. The book is in chapters which the author suggests you read one every couple of days. In each chapter there is a space in which your child is instructed to draw or write something. This helps the information stick in the childs mind and makes it fun for them. this book does not lecture it is gentle and understanding. It is written in an very imaginative way making it both interesting and informative. On the day the book arrived my daughter had 'pulled a sicky' but then owned up that she was worried about school and didnt know why. We were able to read the first chapter of the book which likens a worry to a tomato seed that if tended often, will grow into a huge plant towering over you. By the afternoon she was ready to go to school. ( probably also something to do with no DS, TV or playing games just helping me clean) but seriously this book is absolutely fantastic at explaining feelings why we feel them and how to get through the difficult anxious times. I'm learning a few things too! I am going to reccomend this book to everyone I can think of including the kids schools its amazing and I am about to order more from the series for my son (who realy should worry more!)

9780064441551,"I loved Amelia Bedelia as a child (I remember I asked my mother what draw the curtains meant). My seven year old daughter read it on a car trip. She enjoyed it so much she read it again to my five year old son. I explained draw the curtains, but she also did not get why Amelia cut the towels. Amelia Bedelia is a great book for children to read with/to an adult, because it is easy to read and the humour requires the children to comprehend what they are reading. It is also a good excuse to discuss the difference between what people say and what they actually mean. Amelia Bedelia is a hilarious read and I highly recommend it.",Denise Wessner
9780064441551,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader. Well, everybody knows the antics of Amelia Bedelia, the maid who takes everything literally. This is the first book written about the famous maid, that made her such a beloved literary character. My son loved the book, thought it was just absolutely hilarious and couldn't believe how ""stupid"" she was. ""Stupid"" is a word we are not allowed to say in our house so I asked for another word to describe Amelia and he came up with ""very dumb"". {sigh} We later agreed upon ""very silly"". I wasn't sure he'd like this so much since he's autistic and does take things literally himself, to a point. Truthfully, I never liked Amelia Bedelia as a kid because I just did not get it at all. I found it entirely confusing and I guess that was my Asperger's coming out. Being an extremely literal person, I did not see the joke. (I don't get many jokes) Besides I had no idea what ""trim the fat"" ""dress the turkey"" or ""draw the drapes"", for example, meant in the first place! (I do get it now.) Surprisingly, my son knew what they really meant for her to do in every situation, except ""trim the fat""! For some reason, I have no idea why, while reading this I did wonder if the illustrations were the originals and they are. Fritz Siebel is the original illustrator. However after examining the copyright page, I see that his estate allowed the illustrations to be ""revised"" in 1992. I'm wondering just exactly what was revised for as they stand now there are two things that stand out as having been left ""as is"" when one knows the illustrations have been tampered with. On the first page Mr. Rogers has pipe in mouth and in all the last pages Mrs. Rogers is wearing a real fox stole, complete with head! I'll be looking around to replace my copy with an earlier hardcover ""I Can Read"" book edition (as I collect those) to see for myself just how the illustrations have been ""revised"". I can't see it being much since they left those two very un-PC illustrations alone.",Nicola Mansfield

9781442430419,"Reason for Reading: I received this book unsolicited but it captured my fancy as soon as I saw it. This is an absolutely beautiful book. First of all it reminds me of a late 19th century picturebook with the lavish illustration, the text and the layout when looking at the endpages, the title page, the first page and so on. It has that old-time feel about it, but as one really starts looking the illustrations one recognizes the steampunk theme, the clockworks, the airships. Pure delight! In fact I'm not sure whether I enjoyed the pictures or the story most here. A whimsical story of how the man in the moon got to be there, what he does and how he gathered the guardians of childhood together. Starting with himself, the keeper of lost balloons and secret wishes, he also found Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and others who would protect children from Pitch the keeper of Nightmares.

The illustrations are a little dark, but that is a truer portrayal of the depths of the sea. They are also very soft and calming. Campbell captured the gentle motion of the water very well. In reading the first few pages, it appears that this book is a re-telling of The Little Mermaid (think Disney classic here). As I read further, it became it's own story. Minnow doesn't appear to have any exceptional talents but she proves to be full of questions and quite daring and observant. I ended up really enjoying this story.

9781581341065,"What is the most important thing that a child can learn from his parents? Eight-year-old Caleb and his younger sister Cassie live with their dad and mom. The whole family is striving to be godly. They all regularly attend church services, and every night the parents teach the children about Jesus using the catechism. Caleb's best friend Angus and his family attend the same church, but their other friend Daniel and his family, who recently moved into the community, don't go to church. So Caleb and Angus ask Daniel to go to church with them. Will he be allowed to go? How will his parents react? And what will be the result? The reader needs to be aware that the authors come from a highly Reformed (Calvinistic) religious tradition. Susan Hunt is the women's ministry consultant for Christian Education and Publications of the Presbyterian Church in America. Her son Richie Hunt is the children's and youth minister at Grace Covenant Presbyterian Church in Dallas, GA. Bible believers from other religious backgrounds may not necessarily agree with some concepts and practices set forth in the book, such as salvation by praying to ask Jesus into your heart, total hereditary depravity, tithing, keeping the ""Christian's Sabbath,"" following the Ten Commandments, and baptizing infants. In fact, many of us would prefer to instruct our children simply from the Scriptures rather than using a man-made catechism. However, putting the issue of the catechism aside, the thing I really like about this book is that the 36 stories illustrate how the truth of God's word can be practically applied even in the lives of young children and also how important it is for parents to teach their children what the Bible says. Youngsters have a much greater capacity to learn than a lot of people think, so we shouldn't wait until they're older but start from the very beginning to inculcate within them both Biblical morality and Biblical doctrine. Each chapter concludes with a ""Let's Talk"" section with questions about the lesson and a ""Let's Pray"" section which, rather than having a written prayer to repeat, gives a passage of Scripture and just encourages the reader to pray based upon what that passage says.",Wayne S.

It seems utterly amazing. But this is based on a true story and the volcano really did appear in a farmer's cornfield and bury the village with lava and ash.Written in a simple, easy to understand narrative, from the point of view of the farmer's son Pablo. This is a truly unique story that is sure to please any child, even those who don't usually like non-fiction. The illustrations are ok. We weren't too pleased with the depiction of the erupting volcano as it wasn't realistic enough and my son kept asking what's that?, what's happening there? and it was just that the illustrations didn't show the *how* of it very well. A diagram at this point would have been appreciated. Fortunately, I was able to explain and illustrate with my hands to his satisfaction. Otherwise, a very entertaining book.

9780140305029,"Moomins hibernate every winter with a bellyful of pine needles... but what happens when one of them wakes up before the spring? This book explores Moomintroll's adventures in Moomin Valley after he awakens from his slumber to a sunless world. The book follows the style of the previous titles in this series in some ways, introducing us to quirky new characters, churning out line after line of brillantly quotable dialogue, and raising more than one smile with some eccentric author's notes at the bottom of some of the pages. However, the happy-go-lucky life normally associated with Moomintroll is drastically changed, and in this sense we realise that Moominpappa's and Moominmamma's beloved son is starting to grow up. It's both amusing and slightly sad to see how Moomintroll reacts to the new world around him - with denial, anger and a heart-rending longing for the spring. But, as you might expect from a Moomin book, there's lots of adventures to be had nevertheless, meaning that the reader is carried away on a rather wonderful ride filled with endearing squirrels, sculptures that come to life and lots and LOTS of lovely, lovely jam. A brilliant read for young and old Moomin fans alike.",Dipika Patel

Wendy does not like to cackle or talk in a scary voice. And she cannot stand darkness. Wendy begs her older sisters to teach her their witchy ways, but they refuse. Polly and Wog do not think that she has what it takes to be a true witch. She cannot even keep track of her own broom! Sad and alone on Halloween night, Wendy wonders what will become of her.

9780763649968,"Reason for Reading: I am a fan of the author. This is a lovely Christmas picture book that, aside from a religious aspect, captures the true essence of Christmas. First of all, the illustrations are absolutely breathtaking paintings done in acrylic gouache. They place the story in the past sometime, but it is not until we see the photograph of the man in uniform do we place the story as being during, World War II. This book is worthy for its pictures alone. Yet, it has a text equally breathtaking to match. The story of a little girl who has compassion for the organ grinder she sees across the street each day, wondering where they go at night. The mother has no time for the girl's interest in the man, understandably so, under her circumstances. But when the girl stays up late one night and finds out that they live on the street, she sees the sadness in the man's eyes and invites him to church to watch her Christmas Pageant. At first it does not look as if the man will show up and the girl, playing an angel cannot get her lines out. But when she sees him enter the church she boldly cries ""I bring you tidings of Great Joy!"" Later, we see the organ grinder happily talking to the mother at a reception in the church hall. A heartwarming, touching story for the Christmas season which I think shows a great response to Christ's words ""whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.""

9781416986898,"I have not graded this book - but if I go looking for a description i like to post them and share them .. and save someone else (you) the trouble. ....... PreS-Gr 3-For those who like their picture books with a little edge and offbeat humor, this is a surefire hit. Henry and Eve are ""going through a TERRIBLE phase""; they whine constantly and are eventually stolen by a monster and taken to his lair. To be fair, their kindly father did warn them. Luckily, the monster and his wife whine and argue even more than the children, and cannot agree on what to make: whiny-child salad, burgers, or vindaloo? On the advice of a deliciously cantankerous aunt, the monsters finally agree on simple whiny-child cucumber sandwiches on fluffy white bread. In the meantime, however, the clever children escape, having learned an important lesson about whining-mostly. The recipe for cucumber sandwiches, minus the whiny children, is included. Kaplan's minimalist cartoon illustrations bring to mind Quentin Blake's work and complement the humorous, quirky text with its askew frames, thick black lines, and color accents. The book makes a great read-aloud. Opportunities for whiny monster voices abound, and readers are guaranteed a laugh when the monster's wife insists she cannot eat whiny-child cake because her bottom is too big. Suzanne Myers Harold, Multnomah County Library System, Portland, OR Â©ï¸ Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc. -------------- From Booklist Take a dollop of Edward Gorey, add a dash of Lemony Snicket and a soupcon of Struwwelpeter, stir briskly, and voila! You have Monsters Eat Whiny Children. New Yorker cartoonist Kaplan's first picture book for children is a droll cautionary tale about what happens when whiny little Henry and Eve are kidnapped by a hungry monster and whisked off to his house. There, the monster and his wife begin to argue about how to serve the kids, who are sitting in a salad bowl, still whining. Then a neighbor arrives with his own idea of a menu (whiny-child burgers), and the kitchen is soon filled with disputatious monsters, and, sure enough, their bickering eventually allows the kids to make an escape. Kaplan's distinctive cartoon drawings adorn each page and-no surprise-add a seasoning of welcome humor. As a bonus, the endpapers feature a mini adventure that invites readers to employ their own imaginations. Grades K-3. --Michael Cart",Julie Sincock

I still have a very battered copy on my bookshelves from my own childhood which I'm looking forward to sharing with my child pretty soon (it's equally suitable for boys and girls). The Robber Hotzenplotz is one of those fabulous books that you might not recall for years after reading it, but you'll never forget it. It has drama, humour, a couple of dastardly villains, heroes you want to root for, and a good fairy named Amaryllis. You could want no more from a story. If you're looking for a book for an older reader, Preussler's The Satanic Mills is another winner (and no, I'm not related or on commission!).",Kate Thomson
9780140363821,"One of my all time favourite books. I discovered this book on World Book Day many years ago and happily went up to the register clutching the book and my book token. I laughed so much reading the antics of Roo and Grandfather. It's an absolutely wonderful book, I can't express how much I adore it. It's 80 pages long, oh I wish it was longer but I'm only now (many years later) purchasing the 3 other books that followed in ""The Last..."" series. I can't wait to read them. The Last Polar Bears is a beautiful tale of Grandfather's expedition to the North Pole to see with his own eyes, The Last Polar Bears. He brings his dog Roo, who only goes on the belief that there will be ice cream and who is the true star of the show. Roo is hilarious and smart and absolutely wonderful! I can't do the book justice with the sentences I've typed. Just know that if you read this book, you won't regret it. Five stars every time.",SSlatts
9781414348308,"I have been trying to incorporate Bible reading into my girls' (ages 4.5 and 1.5) daily routine, and this book has been a great help. It uses the NLT, which is generally easier to understand. There are 85 stories from both new and old testament, written in actual Bible text, but abridged, so I don't lose their attention (the older one's, at least). I like that it exposes the kids to actual Bible-speak without being too overwhelming. The kids enjoy the different activities that are scattered throughout the stories, and at the end of each. I particularly like Pockets the Kangaroo, who leads a short prayer connected to the story at the end of the story. Colorful illustrations help hold interest as well.

Years ago, when the movie version, starring Johnny Depp, was released, I absolutely loved it and fell in love with the story and characters. Well, this is one of those cases of wrongfully watching the movie before reading the book. They were so utterly and completely different. In all honesty, I didn't really like the book.

9781554515653,"I received an eARC copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley. I also borrowed the print version from my library. Here is my honest review. A sweet story with a message for all of us to slow down a little and notice things. As with most picture books, it is the art that captures our eye; Petricic has done a phenomenal job with this book. Despite being a 2D flat picture, one can sense movement and hear sound. It's incredible. Worth noting: a notice on the back states: ""A portion of the proceeds from this book will be donated to a charity that promotes engagement with music among young people."" As a mom, I think this is a book we should read often to remind us to pause with our children and discover the world around them. It is so new to them and we have a chance to see the world through new eyes again. As a teacher, this is a book that I would definitely want in my classroom library. It would make a wonderful book to build a writing/illustrating unit around. It is also a great example of a fiction work based on a true event (non-fiction). This is a book that I will be adding to our bookshelf.",Cassie Larson

9781615992119,"Have you ever known anyone with cerebral palsy? Do you know what it is and how it affects people? While helping her mother with a special needs class at a local community center, a seven year old girl befriends another seven year old girl named Suhana who has cerebral palsy. Suhana cannot stand, walk, talk, play, answer when called, play tag or hopscotch, or ride a bike like other children. However, Suhana's new friend holds her, rocks her, comforts her, helps her in other ways, and just generally shows love to her. She especially draws pictures for her. How do you think Suhana responds to the girl's art? When I lived and preached in Dayton, OH, there was a young man attending the congregation who had cerebral palsy. His mind was brilliant, and he could do many amazing things with a computer. Unfortunately, his body was twisted and he was confined to a wheelchair. However, he didn't let that stop him. Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition which causes physical disability in human development, chiefly in the various areas of bodily movement. ""Cerebral"" means having to do with the brain. ""Palsy"" means having a problem with moving. The cause is believed to be congenital, coming at or about the time of birth, resulting from a permanent, non-progressive defect or lesion of the immature brain, and producing a central motor dysfunction affecting muscle tone, posture, and movement. My Friend Suhana, for which Kindle and ePub editions are also available, was inspired by the experiences of the authors. Shaila Abdullah, a writer and designer, and her daughter Aanyah, now ten, often volunteer at a special needs community center, and Aanyah is drawn to children born with physical and mental disabilities. In addition to the cute story with adorable illustrations, the book contains a page of general facts about cerebral palsy to help youngsters better understand this condition. They will learn that while a person who has CP finds it difficult to communicate or control movement, he or she still needs love and can make friends. It is a simple tale of love and friendship that will warm everyone's heart.",Wayne S. Walker
9780807507940,"Reason for Reading: I am working my way through the original 19 books. This is also from the Random Bookshelf I am reading from. Returning to the typical theme of these books, the mystery involves finding out the identity of a mystery person. This time it is a little different though as the children can't find the person but know he is there. Grandfather takes the children plus Ben's friend Mike, again, to the South Seas to a desert island for a vacation. Lars is their guide and completes the group. While having fun living on a deserted island the group find clues that there is someone else on the island and eventually meet a castaway boy. The tale he has to tell them is adventurous and exciting. This is a fun book in the series. It holds true to form and gives what is expected from the series by now. Grandfather's inclusion stunts the children's style a bit but they do get some time to go off on their own. Children will enjoy the excitement of the castaway boy and his experiences, but I think the story would have been better served if he had been introduced earlier as we don't get enough time with him. Overall, a good entry in the series.",Nicola Mansfield

Being about a third grader it certainly is for the younger crowd but elementary students will probably have a hard time reading it themselves as it is not exactly an easy read and the print is quite tiny. No, this story is going to be much more appreciated as a read aloud. It's the first day of school once again and Stuart, constant worrier, has even more things to worry about than usual. But with the help of his magical cape he made for himself he thinks he'll be able to make it big at school this year. Well, magic doesn't always work the way you want it to and Stuart ends up having some hilarious adventures and in the end the cape does help him make friends but not because of the magic. The last page contains a step-by step ""how to draw Stuart"" which looks simple enough for anyone to try.

9781408845462,"Unnatural Creatures is a collection of short stories compiled by Neil Gaiman. From werewolves to cockatoucans - there's a lot of variety in this volume to interest readers. And whilst I found the stories entertaining, what I loved most about this book was the personal touches. Before each story, Gaiman gives a brief synopsis of the author and why he included the story in this book. The illustrations which accompanied the tales added perfectly to the reading experience. It is clear upon reading Unnatural Creatures that each story was selected with care. Most compilations I've read contain stories which have no apparently relation to the others but in this book - whilst the tales are independent, they each feel as if they belong in the same compilation as the others included. Each of the sixteen stories give something different. I had my favourites amongst them with Diana Wynne Jones' tale about gods, a missing Sage, and invisible dragons being the one I liked most. Gaiman himself contributed a story about a Sunbird and there is even a story with a completely unpronounceable title made up of a cartoon instead. I loved the inclusion of the cartoon story and never realized before just how creepy a plain and simple black dot could be ... I was surprised by the variety of the authors. Some of the stories in this book were first written a hundred years ago with others being relatively recent in comparison. This is a compilation like no other - the diverse backgrounds of authors, the creatures which they wrote about and the era in which they were written all add to the dark and fantastical vibe. Mythology, horror and the supernatural - Unnatural Creatures is a short story compilation with vast appeal. With a wide range of creatures and authors, I feel this is a book which will interest fantasy fans, young and old alike.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts

Three children, who appear to be 9 or 10 year olds find a lunchbox with an apple in it then one of them mentions a few elements from a popular fairy tale, in this case Snow White. Then another says that's not the version I've heard and they proceed to tell an ethnic version of the Snow White story.

Then the final chapter brings us back to what the children were doing in the first place that brought the topic up. All the books in this series follow the same format. Snow White is explored here with versions from Greece, Armenia and Italy. I didn't quite enjoy this as much as the previous book from the series, ""Crumbs"", that I have read so far. The stories were all entertaining. I especially enjoyed the first one, perhaps because it was so similar to the Snow White story, the other two were less similar though they did have direct connections with each other. The tale from Armenia was quite unique. I also enjoyed that I had not heard any of the tales before and I've read a lot of fairy tales from around the world. Between each story there is a segue that returns to the original three children and introduces the new tales. The last page in the book tells the author's sources from which she based her tales that may perhaps inspire some to reading the original ethnic tales. As to reading level, there is no reference to it on the books at all. It would have been nice had the publisher's actually determined the RL for the books in this series.

The publisher describes the reading as ""Written in short, easy phrases with carefully selected vocabulary..."" but these are books the parent will have to see to judge whether they are up to your child's reading level. Otherwise, I never find anything wrong with a child reading a book that is too easy, if they enjoy it.

It has wonderful tales inside, and all totally different from each other. The tales are not just the average fairytale you hear from Disney stories about the 'happily ever after' it's far from it... because in these tales, mostly everyone is magic... so it has a rather different twist to your average fairytale.

Numerous events happens along the way as Suzanne Collins (spoilers) pulls a Harry Potter situation and decided most of the characters didn't need to be there as a result she -magically- cut them of (using her keyboard, get it? cause she's the writing? Ohh never mid). It felt quite rushed to me as the characters slowly disappears one by one throughout 5 chapters. But this is not all negative! The book still carries on the concept of a love triangle and seeking vengeance. Thrill seeker will obviously like this book as it is FILLED with amazing events and situations.

9781407132082,"The book takes place in Panem, a country divided in 12 districts, plus the Capitol which controles them. Because of a rebelion, some years ago, - there were 13 districts, but the 13th one was completely destroyed in the events - against the Capitol, they created the Hunger Games. It happens every year and consists in choosing two tributes from each district, one boy and one girl, from the age 12 to 18, to go to this arena and fight for their lives in a game where only one gets out alive. This games were created with the purpose of keeping the districts controled, and combine peace with fear, because it's a way of showing that the Capitol have their lives in their hands and there's no way out of that. And in a twisted way, the Capitol want them to believe they show some kind of mercy towards the ones who betrayed them. The story is told by Katniss Everdeen, sixteen-years-old, who lost is dad in a coal mine explosion and had to take the responsability to guarantee the survival of her family and hers aswell by hunting in the woods were is not allowed to go. Here she is introduced to Gale Hawthorne and they become best friends. The story actually begins when is the time to the 74th annual Hunger Games, and two tributes are going to be chosen and sent to the Capitol. This year is also the year Prim, Katniss' sister, is signing in for the first time to the games and even being the odds in her favor, she is picked up and Katniss ends up volunteering in her place. She's sent with Peeta Mellark, also sixteen, the baker's son to the Capitol, us tributes, and she actually knows him from a difficult situation and a good gesture from him to her from the past. That's when the fun starts, going to the Capitol to get prep and going to the arena with 22 other tributes, some of them who trained all their lifes to be there. MY OPINION AND SPOILERS This book made my heart beat like crazy almost the whole time I was reading it. I felt that I wanted to be there with Katniss the whole time, trying to figure it out what dangers where there when she slept or needed to keep moving or hunting, I don't know, it was crazy. I loved that even reading in Katniss' point of view I was able to know some of the things that crossed other characters' minds by the dialogues, like Peeta's love torwards her being true. It wasn't all expected for me, in exception for the reaping situation, of course, but I was kind of surprised when Peeta discovered that all that Katniss said and done was part of the strategy for their survival, not only his reaction but also hers and how everything went. I mean, the starcrossed lovers strategy they used were Peeta's idea and Haymitch knew he was actually in love, and at the end of the book he really thought that some of her actions were beyond the crowd's amusement and were true. I mean I understand that he didn't know about the strategy between Katniss and Haymitch in the arena, but because I knew all along the feelings Katniss had for him, I dismissed or I didn't even thought about his own perception of her attitudes and words. I was heartbroken when he found out and I was so sorry for him, because at the beginning I was rooting for Gale, but them Peeta is so sweet and really loves her and wants to protect her. I loved that the author was able to bring in the finale, a ""little"" struggle of Katniss' feelings towards the two boys and try to start comprehend them, but in a very smooth way. I really enjoyed the book, great pacing, great suspense throughout the book. We can relate easily with the characters and suffer with them and actually feel like we know them. It was just great, I never felt this was towards a book, and I now that I will re-read it soon.",Catia Sofia Almeida

9781407132082,"In the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen's little sister, Prim, was drawn out of thousands to participate in the games. Fearing for her sister's life, Katniss volunteers herself and knows she must survive for her family's sake. For Katniss, survival is second nature. It took me awhile to really get into the novel, but after several chapters, it really had a hold of me. With its action, twists and plots, The Hunger Games in short is a gripping story about survival in a war and poverty stricken world. Suzanne Collins has created an interesting and complex dystopian, from each districts speciality, to the rules and technicalities of the Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen, our heroine, is a strong, focused and motivated character, who further develops as the story unfolds. Her family values are admirable, and her switched-on personality makes her a likeable and relatable character. She is not your typical girly-girl, in fact, she's a hunter and looking pretty is the least of her concerns. Apart from Katniss, The Hunger Games is laden with various fun and interesting characters. Peeta and Gale, the two male leads, form a love-triangle with Katniss. Gale being her bestfriend, and Peeta, her Hunger Games companion. Both boys have their good qualities and flaws, and both very important to Katniss. Then we have her sister, Prim, and her mother, Haymitch, Effie and the Hunger Games supporting team of designers and make-up artists. And of course there is Katniss' Hunger Game competitors from each district; each player holds their own unique character traits. Overall, The Hunger Games is a great young adult novel. It's a quick and easy read, a page turner, and very engaging. Its plots and twist will keep you amused and interested through out. Highly recommended!",Tran Nguyen

9780061478789,"The first time I ever heard of this book was in 2006 when we lived in St. Louis, MO, and Jackson Pierce, a friend of our younger son Jeremy with whom he played homeschool baseball, gave the following report in the St. Louis Homeschool Network newsletter. ""A long time ago, I had seen ads for the movie Howl's Moving Castle. A few days ago, I saw the book at Borders bookstore, so I bought it. The book starts: 'In the land of Ingary, where things as seven-league boots and cloaks of invisibility really exist, it is quite unfortunate to be born the eldest of three. Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst, if the three of you set out to seek your fortunes.' The main character is Sophie Hatter, the oldest of three sisters. Her parents own a hat shop in a town called Market Chipping. She has two sisters. Her mom died when she was two years old and her sister, Lettie, was one year old. Their dad married an assistant from the hat shop named Fanny and Fanny had the last baby, Martha. Now one day, their father died. Fanny sent Lettie to be apprenticed at Cesari's, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, and Martha to a witch named Annabel Fairfax. Sophie must stay and work in the hat shop. It turns out that Martha and Lettie had switched places and used a spell to make them look like each other. Now it just so happens that there was an evil witch named the Witch of the Waste. Sophie doesn't know that the woman is the witch at first, and insults her, and when the witch leaves, she curses Sophie into looking (and sometimes feeling) like as woman 90 years old! So Sophie goes to the one place that could help her: Wizard Howl's Moving Castle. It's called a 'moving castle' because it literally moves around. The castle had moved near Market Chipping before Sophie had been cursed, so it wouldn't be too much of a walk. But I'm going to stop here, as not to give anything else away. The book is very well written, and is kind of long, but it should only take you 2 or 3 days to read it if you are a fast reader. It is suitable for children of all ages, but that's expected because they made an anime (Japanese animation) movie of it. If you don't want to be too disappointed by the movie, watch it first (it doesn't look very accurate). So in conclusion, I think this book is very good and won't put you to sleep when you read it."" That is a pretty good summary of the plot. A few years later, after we had moved from St. Louis to Salem, IL, we picked Howl's Moving Castle, made from the book in 2004 by Hayao Miyazaki, for a family video. The film generally follows the book, but as Jackson noted there are some major differences. I read several reviews by people who actually liked the movie better than the book. The main complaints about the novel are that it is has poor character development, flimsy story lines, implausible plot devices, and too many words yet not enough real description. Personally, I found the book well-written and generaly easy to read with a fair amount of excitement, but I did note a few concerns. First, the plot has an almost ""absurdist"" quality to it. That doesn't necessarily make it bad, but some people may not care for that sort of story. There are some common euphemisms, such as ""drat"" and ""confound it,"" a few curse-like terms (""damnation"" and ""Hell's teeth""), and one instance of the word ""Lord"" used as an exclamation. Howl has as reputation as a womanizer, courting girls until they fall in love with him then dropping them for someone else but nothing sexual is actually implied. References to drinking beer, brandy, and wine occur, and Howl comes home drunk once towards the end. If you prefer not to have your children reading books which contain magic or witchcraft, you would obviously want to avoid this one. I do make a distinction between books which I believe promote an interest in the occult, such as Harry Potter, and those where the magic or witchcraft is simply part of the fictional setting of a story. Howl's Moving Castle comes about as close to the former as possible, and only the ""absurdist"" nature of the plot might keep it from falling into that category. Author Diana Wynne Jones, was born in London, England, on August 16, 1934, the daughter of Marjorie (nee Jackson) and Richard Aneurin Jones, both of whom were educators. She is a British writer, principally of fantasy novels for children and adults, as well as a small amount of non-fiction. Some of her better-known works include the Chrestomanci series. Her books range from a broad, almost slapstick delight in the construction of absurd-yet-logical situations, especially evident in the endings of some of her books, to sharp social observation, to witty parody of literary forms. Foremost amongst the latter are her Tough Guide to Fantasyland, a non-fiction work on cliches in fantasy fiction that has a cult following as a reference among writers and critics, despite being difficult to find due to an erratic printing history, and its fictional companion-pieces Dark Lord of Derkholm (1998) and Year of the Griffin (2000), which provide a merciless, though not unaffectionate, critique of formulaic sword-and-sorcery epics. Charmed Life, the first book in the Chrestomanci series, won the 1977 Guardian Award for Children's Books. Archer's Goon (1984), a Boston Globe - Horn Book Honor Book and World Fantasy Award for Best Novel nominee, was adapted for television in 1992. According to her autobiography, Diana has been an atheist since she was ten. Howl's Moving Castle won a Boston Globe-Horn Book Award and was named an ALA Notable book for both children and young adults. A sequel, Castle in the Air, was published in 1990. A second sequel, House of Many Ways was released in June 2008. Both are also young adult fantasy novels set in Ingary, though the two works are only loosely related to Howl's Moving Castle.",Wayne S.

9780818402531,"I had this book as a little girl in the 80s and 90s, and it was the one book that didn't sugar coat and lie about things - I absolutely loved it! It's very descriptive, and not at all obscene. It's clear, and makes it fun to learn. It's also good to have those 'a-ha!' moments like ""so *this* is what's happening"" and also to prepare you for what *will* happen so it's not a shock. I've added this to my wishlist for my next payday so I can get a new copy for my own child, and will likely get the follow-on book as well. I remember watching a video version in school, as well.

9780818402531,"an absolutely perfectly balanced book. describes beautifully the creation of a baby. In 1986 many parents were utterly disgusted by this book and tried to ban it from school. i am quite alarmed to see the amount of dislikes marked against this book. Why are people so scared to explain the origin of life to their children? It doesn't need to be done until you know your children are ready to hear it. And the answer to that is simple. They are ready to hear it when they start asking questions. And why do so many children grow up thinking a baby grows in a stomach? Why are we scared to use the word 'womb'. It's like a 'room'. the baby grows in it's special womb-room. It's special. Come on guys! Get with the times! My son is 5 and he knows EVERYTHING because he wants to know - right down to the details of how a sperm has to meet with an egg and implant in the uterus wall, and how twins are made, the difference between identical twins and non-identical. I bet some of you grown ups don't know that. He knows why I have a menstrual cycle - not because I've forced it on him but because he has asked questions! Maybe he's going to be an amazing medical expert one day. I'm proud that he asks, and I'm proud that I know enough to provide him with the answers.

9780006751038,"When I saw the cover of the book, I thought that it would be just another story about an animal with special, unique, or even human characteristics. It is, in fact, a story about an animal but also so much more. The Butterfly Lion is a story about love, faithfulness, destiny and a lucky coincidence. This book with its unpredictable ending begins in a different place and time, but Morpurgo, however, manages to write a story within a story and masterfully connects them into a beautiful vivid tale that teaches us about true love. When ten-year old Michael, the narrator of the story, escapes from school, he meets an old woman - Millie. After a short chit-chat on the street, she invites him to her cosy home. She there tells him the story about the lion and Bertie. This story begins in Africa; the main character Bertie rescues an orphaned lion cub and they are inseparable until the day Bertie has to go to England to boarding school. The lion is sold to a circus and it seems that they will never see each other again. Bertie, however, swears that one day he will find his lion - a friend that made his days in Africa full of joy and happiness. The story offers many unpredictable situations. It captures the atmosphere so beautifully that a reader can easily travel in their mind from one location to another and is never disappointed by any description. It is a human story and a complex tale of different kinds of love. Although it is considered a children's book, an adult reader could enjoy it just as much as a child. Adults, however, will probably understand it differently and find a deeper message that Morpurgo wrapped in intelligent writing. The book can easily make you cry; not because the story is so sad, but because it shows us that although life can be cruel it is also simple in its complexity. Worth reading. Epic. Brilliant. I loved it.",AnjaS
9780440414803,"HOLES was first released over a decade ago, so I have no excuse for not joining the masses in reading it before now. But, I kept telling myself, it's about boys digging holes. What's interesting about that? So years passed. When the anniversary edition, complete with its Newbery-medal-bearing jacket, caught my eye, I decided it was time to see what all the hype was about. After all, clearly the book was good enough to be made into a movie starring some of my favorite actors (Jon Voigt, Henry Winkler, Sigourney Weaver, and a young Shia LaBeouf), so it had to be good, right? Thankfully, this (admittedly flawed) line of reasoning didn't fail me. The book met and exceeded my expectations. A weak but loveable main character named Stanley Yelnats (a clever anagram, no?) leads readers through the main plot. The story is about an adolescent boy sent to a reform camp, where he must dig one grave-sized hole each day as punishment for a crime we're led to believe he did not commit. As I suspected, this plot is no fun. But don't let that fool you! The book itself is chalk full of fun...and it doesn't take long for it to enter the story. A master at suspending disbelief, Sachar weaves together several storylines as he takes us back through Yelnats family history and ties it to the history of Kissin' Kate Barlow, one of the most notorious outlaws in the West. Without revealing too much, and yet dropping enough clues for readers to piece the puzzle together as they go, Sachar unveils each story as a stand-alone piece while keeping firm footing in the main story. One character after another dances through the book and wins over readers with a sympathetic story of his or her own. Luckily, Sachar makes it easy to fall in love with even the most backward-seeming character. No one's life is easy and everyone wants his or her story told. Amazingly, this is accomplished in one reasonably short, action-packed book that more than earned every award piled upon it. I highly recommend picking this one up anytime! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

It is an incredible book which anyone should read if they get the chance, and it has encouraged me to read anything and everything that he's written! I'm currently studying an English unit called Children's Literature at university and this is one of the books we're studying. However, as much as it is a children's book, I found there were many aspects of it that I could relate to as a young adult, and I only wish I had indeed read this as a child so I could then compare the differences in perspective. The illustrations fitted the story perfectly, and I also enjoyed the fact that Gaiman didn't feel the need to tell the reader everything there was to know, thereby leaving some of the mystery of Bod's graveyard intact even after you've finished the story.",Rachel Fetherston
9780060530945,"To start, I have to say that even though I have been reviewing young adult books, I have only been reviewing them from an adult point of view. I enjoyed reading this book so much and feel that, like his other book that I recently read, CORALINE, this is also a metaphor for growing up. That said, I shall revert to my young adult point of view. I don't know that I knew much about metaphors and the like when I was younger, but overlooking any of that this was an awesome book to read. I enjoyed the characters throughout the book, especially the people who took care of Bod on a daily basis, like Miss Lupescu and Liza. The ending was kind of sad for me, though I knew it had to happen that way for the story to come to an end. The story itself was very descriptive and I felt as if I was growing up along with Bod. The only thing that I would have changed is that I wanted to know more about The Jacks and the prophecy that they spoke of.

9780545132060,"Reason for Reading: This is a Cybils '10 nominee and required reading for me as a graphic novels panelist. This is a graphic memoir that follows the author from grade six through her sophomore year of high school specifically focusing on her dental problems. In the 6th grade, just shortly before she is scheduled for braces for an overbite Raina trips and knocks out her 2 front teeth. A host of other problems follow as we watch Raina's dental nightmare over the next several years. During this time Raina is going through adolescence, her normal self-esteem issues at this age are multiplied by the extensive work she has done which includes a retainer with two false front teeth attached to it. I loved this book. First the artwork is wonderful. Cartoony but so very expressive. The characters facial expressions almost tell the story by themselves. Set in the late eighties, there are lots of fun retro moments for adult readers in the background as one notices her watching 'Silver Spoons' on TV and they play an original 8-bit Nintendo system. The dental story is transfixing. I didn't wear braces myself, so that and all the extra problems of missing teeth and loss of bone, etc. was fascinating. Raina goes through this experience with pain and complaints but she is a happy child and can always see the bright side of things, eventually. Children going through/or about to will identify with Raina and feel for her while at the same time being thankful they only have to wear braces. This is also a story about growing up and it very nicely shows how Raina slowly notices over the years how she has become the butt of jokes in her group of friends and while no one is mean to her (on purpose) she's not exactly in healthy relationships friend-wise. As she grows older she finds new interests, meets new friends, become boy conscious and starts to feel good about herself on the outside but more importantly ... on the inside. One notices all the issues being dealt with within this story without an issue being made out of them and the story is a very enjoyable read. Both funny and emotional. It isn't until the end that the author spends a mere two pages waxing eloquently about how in hindsight she realized she'd moved beyond the child stage and grown-up a bit by the time her braces were removed. A story that really grabs you from the beginning, un-put-downable, with a main character who is a joy to meet and get to know.",Nicola Mansfield
9780545132060,"Raina is struggling with one specific aspect of her life... her smile. Having to get braces, she's dreading having to be a brace face, metal mouth - anything you want to label it. However, it's her smile, especially her teeth, that will haunt her all the way through middle school and up into high school. From having them knocked out, to wearing head gear, to even having to get a retainer with two fake front teeth. To get that perfect smile it's going to be a long journey... and a very painful one, at that. Along the way, social problems continue to follow Raina. From crushing on a younger guy, to getting that athlete to notice her, to even standing up for herself after she's had enough of the humiliation, Raina discovers who she is, how she shouldn't change anything about herself, and that true friends would never make or put you in awkward situations. Accompanied by colorful pictures, a cute and realistic storyline, and a main character that any person will be able to identify with, SMILE by Raina Telgemeier does one thing especially well... it makes the reader smile! Many of us have experienced getting braces, feeling the intense pain when we want that bite of the burger we can't have just yet. Almost all of us can understand what it's like when you want to break apart from the not-so-great friends we've had. Telgemeier does a fantastic job in capturing the true essence and emotions of a person going through changes.

9780545027892,"Reason for Reading: I loved The Invention of Hugo Cabret and have just been waiting for Selznick to follow it up with something similar. Following the same ""genre-breaking form"" he established in The Invention of Hugo Cabret, Selznick returns to the half text/half wordless picture book to tell two parallel stories set fifty years apart until they eventually merge together into the same tale. The first story set in the 1970s features Ben whose mother has just died in a car accident; he's never known who his father was and after looking around his mom's room he discovers some clues to his identity. He runs away to New York in search of the man he's never known. Fifty years earlier in the 1920s, we are introduced to Rose, a young girl with a fixation on a silent movie star who feels trapped in her own home. She too runs away to New York to find a friend named Walter, who will hopefully help her escape her strict father. Eventually the two stories catch up to each other and merge into one story. Ben's story is told purely in text using roughly about 200 pgs., while Rose's story is told in the remaining 400-odd pages in wordless illustrated sequences. As each story alternates, the reader switches gears from reading words to gazing enraptured at the illustrations. The artwork, needless to say in superb! Selznick has created another masterpiece in this hybrid of novel and picture book. The story is compelling and touching. The characters lovable and real. My only beef would be that Hugo Cabret included with the illustrations photos and movie stills; Wonderstruck is pure illustration. I think the topic, themes and time period would have lent themselves well to including this type of media as well, especially considering one of the 1920s characters is a famous silent film/stage star. Otherwise a pure delight! Of the two I liked Hugo better but this is a worthy follow up and still deserving of a top rating. Looking forward to seeing Selznick continue in this fascinating format in a future book.",Nicola Mansfield

When he finds a mysterious note that could possibly lead him to the father he's never known, he has to make the decision whether to follow his heart or stay where he is. Rose, a young girl, feels lost and alone in a house with her stern father. With her mother out of the picture and her older brother living in New York, she is completely cut off from everyone. After one too many disagreements with her father, Rose decides to strike out on her own to New York City to find some peace of mind.

9780763622282,"Encyclopedia Prehistorica Dinosaurs is a book filled with surprises and is sure to win over the hearts of little boys or anyone young at heart. I bought the book for my five-year-old nephew and it has become one of his favorite books. Like many boys, my little nephew is a dinosaur freak. He surrounds himself with his farm of animal toys, dresses in dinosaurs t-shirts and can spend hours sharing his dinosaur knowledge with me. As such, I know that a best present for him would be something dinosaur-related. Therefore, I was searching for a dinosaur book and was pleasantly surprised when I found Encyclopedia Prehistorica Dinosaurs which is a rare pop-out book on dinosaurs. The book did not disappoint. It is a rather huge book and its appearance kind of reminds me of those ancient and mysterious encyclopedias you can find in libraries. My nephew could not wait to lay his hands on the book when he first saw it. He was so excited as though he was going on his first exploration trip. And what an exploration trip it was! I opened the book with him and we were both amazed at the color of the pictures and the large number of pop-out dinosaurs. The pop-out dinosaurs were very delicately crafted and looked very realistic. My favorite was the page with the humongous pop-out T-rex head. My nephew did not expect it and screamed when I first flipped to that page. I like that there are also hidden pop-outs in the book. To see them, you have to lift certain flaps in the books. As such, this adds a layer of mystery as you explore the book because you will never know what will come out until you open the flap. While the pictures and pop-out art in the book are great, I feel that the text can be a little bit challenging for young kids to read on their own. Some of the words are too scientific and are a little difficult. As such, it is best if a parent or an adult can guide the child as he reads it. This book is definitely fun to read and the child can always revisit the book as he gets older. I think it is also a good product to get children to start reading and to love reading. The book is a bit costly. However, given the detailed and mesmerizing artworks presented, I believe the book is definitely worth the amount of money. The artist and writer have also produced pop-out books on other themes. If your child is not into dinosaurs, you can also purchase books on other themes. I am pretty confident that they will be of just as good a quality as Encyclopedia Prehistorica Dinosaurs.",Khalid

First of all, he lives in an orphanage where he is constantly teased by all the other children. Then there's the fact that he's a genius. He's so smart that he needs his own tutor, Ms. Perumal, who is really more of a friend to him. It's because of Ms. Perumal that Reynie happened to be reading the newspaper that held a one-of-a-kind advertisement. ""Are You a Gifted Child Looking for Special Opportunities?"" Not only does this advertisement catch Reynie's eye, but that of many young children. All of these children enroll to take several tests consisting of many brain teasers. Out of all the children, though, only four succeed, with Reynie being one of the four. The children are all immediately drawn to each other. Not just because of their exceptional mental abilities, but also because they are all alone. Reynie, Kate, and Constance are all orphans, and Sticky has run away from a miserable home life. When they all finish with their tests they are led to a mysterious old house where they are introduced to Mr. Benedict. Mr. Benedict is an intriguing and incredibly smart man who has a secret mission for the children that only they can complete. To fulfill their mission, the children must go undercover at the Learning Institute for the Very Enlightened. The headmaster of the school, Mr. Curtain, is up to no good, and it is up to the children to figure out what he is up to and hopefully stop him. It will be no easy feat, as the children will have to wrap their minds around puzzle after puzzle and face challenges that not even their wildest dreams could have ever created. With no choice but to turn to each other, the children embark on a journey that will forever change their lives. I have heard nothing but good things about this book. Needless to say, I had high expectations for it. Overall, I really enjoyed THE MYSTERIOUS BENEDICT SOCIETY, except I found that at times it was a bit lacking. First, I want to say that the author's writing style was marvelous. It definitely had the magic feeling that Roald Dahl put into his books that made them so wonderful. There was that extra umph to the book that made it quite enjoyable. Returning again to my reference of Roald Dahl, I felt like the adventure these kids went on was much like the adventure Charlie from CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY went on, without the candy! While the book is directed at a more middle grade audience, I still found myself enjoying the adventure and solving the riddles along with the children. Overall, I enjoyed the story and think it would be a great book for both reluctant readers and middle graders.",TeensReadToo

The one and only bright light in Aman's life is a foreign dog that becomes attached to the boy, and he to it. However, the entire book is not Aman's alone. The author deftly weaves 3 different characters' points-of-view together, so that the reader can take in the bigger picture. Matt, a British boy tells his own part of the story too, of his friendship with Aman in the schoolyard. Also, Matt's grandfather reveals his portion to the reader, giving you the full overview. Aman, imprisoned in a detention center, along with his mother, desires to become free in England. But no one will listen to his story. Except for one person.

In INVISIBLE STANLEY, eating fruit during a storm proves to be just the combination to turn Stanley invisible. He's been flat, he's been to outer space, but invisible?

9781848452398,"The plot of this book was really good. Some things I saw coming, and some things I didn't. I didn't mind it that some things might have been a little bit predictable because it was executed in a great way. There is a constant flow of action and mystery going on and the battle and fighting scenes are just awesome. But I must say that I even more like the quiet and intimate scenes where you can really get to know Yelena when she is not fighting for her life. Those moments were written down so well, I just could see myself sitting on a couch next to Yelena and she would be telling me the story of her life. There was some romance in this book but what I really liked is that it didn't took over the story. The story is (in my opinion) about Yelena trying to survive and finding a place for herself in this world. The characters in this book were amazing. First we have Yelena, the main female character. She is strong, stubborn and she admits that she has murdered someone but she also had a very good reason for doing this. She has some amazing talents and I love her character so much. Then there is Valek, a very mysterious and maybe even sometimes creepy kind of guy and love interest. He is more then just an assassin, he has more talents then just murdering people. I loved Valek a whole lot and I think that he is a refreshing type of love interest. And while the main characters in this book were amazing by far my favourite are two side characters. I'm talking about Ari and Janco. They are hilarious but also so strong and I just love the whole big brother thing they have going on with Yelena. Another character that I have to mention is Irys. She isn't that much in the book but she does play a significant role in the end and she was really awesome, I hope to see more of her in the second book! The last character that I want to mention is the commander. The commander has so much layers, it just keeps going on! I have so far never met any type of character with these types of layers in any of my books and I love the commander for surprising me sometimes with everything that is going on.

9781419705847,"Oh, dear! Another ""Wimpy Kid"" book. Will they ever end, or will we follow Greg Heffley all the way to the nursing home? I actually asked the publisher not to send me any more of these books because I really don't like them, but I am a book reviewer, so they send them anyway. I realize that they are immensely popular with many children and that some critics have praised them to the highest heavens as being truly in tune with the problems and angst of the modern middle school student. This may be part of the reason why they simply don't appeal to me whatever. I was in ""middle school"" (we called it upper elementary and junior high then) back in the 1960s, so the events and feelings of Greg are very far removed from my own experiences. Furthermore, the things described in the book are exactly the kinds of negative public-school related experiences from which Christian parents who homeschool wish to shelter their children. In The Third Wheel, Greg, who I believe is just in either seventh or eighth grade now, is really concerned about not having a girlfriend, especially with the upcoming Valentine's Day Dance. This may seem strange to a lot of folks, but at one time nearly all religious people opposed mixed dancing, and there are still a few of us around today. These kids are but twelve or thirteen, yet there is a lot of talk about getting a date and how to go about it. This is only middle school, yet Greg says, ""It's hard to keep track of who has gone out with who in my school,"" one boy boasts ""that he's kissed a bunch of different girls in my grade,"" and one couple has ""been going out...since the fifth grade."" Whatever happened to protecting the innocence and purity of children rather than pushing them into sexualized situations at earlier and earlier ages? I guess that this is what disturbs me most about these Wimpy Kid books, especially since they're marketed to children as young as eight. In addition to the dancing and the dating, there are references to other such wonderfully educational experiences in school that leave such pleasant memories as kids having toilet paper fights, people making obnoxious noises at a fellow named Bryan Buttsey, and guys getting ""pantsed."" Also, Greg's Uncle Gary has been married four times, spends what money he has on scratch lottery tickets at the convenience store, and is addicted to a virtual-world computer game-a really great role model! Thankfully, the language is not too bad, with only a couple of common euphemisms (heck, dang it), although Greg does use the expression, ""God knows what else."" There may actually be some real humor somewhere in the story, but it's completely lost on me. Admittedly, young people could be reading worse, but they could certainly read a lot better. So far as I can tell, there is simply nothing in the Wimpy Kid books that would be of any interest to godly people.",Wayne S. Walker
9780590353427,"This is the third time I've read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I really enjoyed reading this along with Pottermore. Pottermore incorporates a lot of the details mentioned in the story. It was fun to pay attention to the little details this time since I know the story so well. I also liked reading the bonus material she wrote on Pottermore - it adds a lot to the story. I don't know if I realized this before, but J.K. Rowling is excellent at showing and not telling. For example: ""[Mr. Dursley] hummed ""Tiptoe Through the Tulips"" and as he worked, jumped at small noises."" She doesn't have to say that he's starting to lose it because I've decided that for myself. The books have so many fun characters that aren't in the movies. I love how optimistic and humble Harry is.

As I stated above, the author is just amazing in how she organized the book and made all the characters so different from each other, yet they all can be classified as ""normal enough"" (for the most part anyways). Yet in their own way, all the people were a bit puzzling. Ellen definitely has her own unique writing style and it is clear to see that she took her time to ponder on this storyline (and it's for the better that she did). Okay, enough about the author! Let me tell you a bit about the storyline: Samuel Westing (AKA ""Uncle Sam""--because he was a very patriotic man) has been located in his mansion.... DEAD. Everyone who was in his will were all (coincidentally, of course) invited to check out the apartments in Sunset Towers (which weren't even towers). Also, (again coincidentally) all members-of-the-will accepted the apartments (of course the surprise of finding out that they are in this man's will, would come after they move in). Anyways, when they finally come together to read the will... all 16 heirs are in for a real shocker! The will turns out to be this clever puzzle they have to solve. There's 8 teams and each team only gets 2 clues, so they'll do anything to peek over someone's shoulder to find new clues staring them in the face. Oh! And did I mention that whoever figures out the answer to the puzzle first, will win $200 million? Yeah, sorry if I forgot to mention that.

9780440867388,"I have to say that this is a truly amazing read. I'm one of those people who become addicted to a book and have a desire for those fast-pace action and especially fantasy. It definitely had action and a tiny bit of fantasy added into it. I just have to say, this is probably the greatest book in a series that I've ever read apart from Rick Riordan's books of course; the man is a genius writer. I definitely reccommend, you will definitely NOT be sorry. Don't wait to order, I made the mistake of not picking it up earlier when people were reading it and I waited years later to get a hold of them. GET IT NOW!!!(:",Tayla Shelton
9780007267002,"Reason for Reading: I've read and enjoyed the author before plus I am a Titanic fan. This is an entirely fictional story about three things, two of them rooted in actual fact. First and foremost it is the story of fourteen year old Johnny Trott, orphan, currently working as bell boy at the Savoy Hotel, secondly it is a story of how the famous sculpture of the Savoy Hotel cat may have come to be and thirdly, it is an account of the sinking of the Titanic. An important guest at the hotel befriends Johnny and instructs him to watch over her cat, Kaspar, while she is away from her rooms. Misfortune befalls her and Johnny keeps the cat as his own. Then another family comes to stay and he befriends the impish daughter of a wealthy couple. Here we deal with different types of friendship and love that Johnny has never experienced in his life before and this is the basic theme of the book. To add some adventure, the family is fated to sail home to New York on the ""unsinkable"" ship, the Titanic. Both Johnny and Kaspar end up on board but I won't tell you how or why but this eventually leads to the sculpture of the Kaspar cat being presented to the Savoy. A fun story that will appeal to both boys and girls. It is an easy-going book with the first half dedicated to Johnny and his relationships, much more character driven than anything else. I enjoyed this half the best. The second half picks up the pace and adds escapades and finally an account of the Titanic's sinking that is quite realistic. The author ends with a Post Script telling the reader how, as a writer, he pulled the real elements from life and created his fictional story from them. Final word on the illustrations, Michael Foreman is a prolific illustrator and one of the best England has to offer. This book is no exception; it is profusely illustrated, in colour, and it was a delight to read a chapter book in colour for a change.",Nicola Mansfield
9780786838653,"OMG, I loved this story. In the beginning I really needed to put the movie out of my head and I tried to see it a different way. I really like the writing style of Rick Riordan. The story has a lot of plot twists and it gives me a Harry Potter-like feeling (which I love). It's a very fast-paced story and within a 100 pages or so you're entirely inside the story. I liked the main character, Percy(who sometimes reminds me of Harry). He seems to be a very normal kid and is easy to relate to. This book was an amazing read and I really enjoyed the mythological aspects, which make me want to read about myths again. So I just loved this story, everything about it. I give it 5 out of 5 stars!!",Myra
9780316003742,"This story is entirely in black and white with simple outline drawings. Like the early episodes of the Simpsons, characters are recognisable but the style is still forming and growing. Tintin has a much rounder head and there is less definition in the character's features. However, the simplistic method and the monochrome texture means you don't stop to admire the view and are whisked along by the story. It was originally a newspaper comic strip so the regular cliff-hangers mean that Tintin is getting shot at, blown-up, or in car crashes every other page. Whilst this gets a bit fatiguing after a while it means the story moves along at a fair old pace. You won't get bored and can finish the book very quickly. Herge wrote this in 1929 meaning the politics are just as black and white as the pictures. The Soviets are evil. Like the Nazis in Indiana Jones they have no redeeming features. This conjures the feel of an old Saturday Morning serial like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers. Much of the humour wouldn't look out of place in a Charlie Chaplin movie either. This is definitely a fascinating snapshot of a bygone era and quite an accomplishment for a 22 year old amateur with no formal art training. Whilst the English translation can sometimes get a bit patchy it is still an interesting read. Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels
9780440867395,"The second book of the Ranger's Apprentice series takes us through the journeys of young Will throughout the lands of the Celts. This time seeking the aid of the Celt people against the evil Morgarath etc etc. There they will find a land torn and split as...well i shouldn't actually say due to spoil but...Morgarath has been taking Celts as slaves. Will will then have to find out what Morgarath is planning and stop his devious plans. Once again John Flanagan manages to create another interesting story of the ranger's apprentice story. This particular one is, in my opinion, far better than the first one. For starters this book introduces some new characters who are quite interesting and add up to the Araluan world giving you a more overall view of the rangers and the kingdom in gerenarl. Also it has more action as we will see Will and other characters to be forced to kill for the very first time. Again i am very satisfied by the way this book is written, giving enough detail without becoming excessive and tiresome. The storyline is more action oriented and you will find out that the ranger's series has more to what meets the eye as the book has many twists that i must say i wasn't really expecting (or actually was but didn't want to believe them) I honestly recomend this book as well as the entire series without any hesitation.",splashofourworlds.blogspot.com

9780375869020,"What a wonder of a book! First sentence: I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid. August (Auggie) is 10-year-old born with a cranio-facial abnormality that, in spite of who he is inside, makes him stand out in a crowd. This is the story of his first year in school, told in the first person through various viewpoints - Auggie, his sister Olivia(Via), her boyfriend Justin, her friend Miranda, and Auggie's friends Jack and Summer. I love how this story is told in a realistic, ""that's just the way it is"" fashion - even Via, who is a teenager, pretty much rolls with the fact that most of the attention goes to Auggie - with all of the surgeries that he has had, that's just to be expected. She's always stuck up for him, and never, until this first year of her going to a new high school, felt at all ashamed of his appearance. Auggie? Well, he's just a great kid - a Star Wars fan, an XBox-playing, joke-making, pretty smart little dude who loves his family and their dog Daisy, bought off of a homeless guy for $20 by Auggie's father. He has a loving and imperfect family, he doesn't feel sorry for himself (much), and seeing the world through his eyes made this reader even more grateful and appreciative. Of course we run into the casually (and not so casually) cruel kids and adults, but Auggie, who wasn't too keen on the idea of going to school, manages to make some friends, and, if he doesn't blend in, at least people get used to him. Then a boy he thought was his friend seems to turn against him, and we all feel the hurt. Another boy starts a bullying campaign, and here is where we see Auggie's true strength come to the fore. His friendships are tested, and his friends make the reader proud. At the end of this book, and throughout the last pages, I was wiping away tears, the kind of tears inspired by hope and a touch of the happy. This book is geared to middle readers (8-12 years old), but is definitely one that everyone should read. Teachers, homeschoolers, parents, and even adults - pick this one up - you will love it as much as I did. And you will LOVE Auggie! This one will definitely be showing up on my ""Best of"" list for 2012; it's a winner all around. QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy): Auggie: I know ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kid run away screaming in playgrounds. Auggie: I think it's like the Cheese Touch in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"". The kids in that story were afraid they'd catch the cooties if they touched the old moldy cheese on the basketball court. At Beecher Prep, I'm the old moldy cheese. Summer: So I just went over and sat with him. Not a biggie. I wish people would stop trying to turn it into something major. He's just a kid. The weirdest-looking kid I've ever seen, yes. But just a kid.

9780141332598,"Egypt is one of the oldest literary cultures on earth, dating from 3200 B.C. when Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt. The tales in this book are divided into three sections. ""Tales of the Gods"" tell myths about ancient Egyptian deities such as Amen-Ra, Isis, Osiris, Thoth, Horus, Khnemu, and others. ""Tales of Magic"" relate legends about semi-historical figures in ancient Egypt like Seneferu, Khufu, Rameses the Great, and Bata. And ""Tales of Adventure"" contain other stories that the ancient Egyptians recorded. These tales are taken from the hieroglyphics carved on temples and tombs and the later papyri written after Demotic script superseded the old hieroglyphs. There are a few references to drinking wine and beer, but there is also a mention of Joseph and the Israelites in the prologue implying that the author considered them genuine historical entities. A time chart of Egyptian history places the different tales into their historical context, and there are several pages of facts about ancient Egyptian culture and beliefs. The book would make an excellent complement to a homeschool study of ancient Egypt. Roger Gilbert Lancelyn Green (1918-1987), born in Norwich, England, was a British biographer, children's writer, and Oxford academic who formed part of the Inklings literary discussion group along with C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. He had studied under Lewis at Merton College, Oxford, and remained close to Lewis until the latter's death in 1963. In fact, when Lewis started writing his famous children's fantasy books in the late 1940s, it was Green who encouraged him to publish it and suggested that they should be called The Chronicles of Narnia. Green became known primarily for his writings for children, particularly his retellings of the myths of Greece in Tales of the Greek Heroes (1958), The Tale of Troy (1958), and Tales the Muses Told: Ancient Greek Myths (1965); and The Tale of Thebes (1977); Norse mythology in The Saga of Asgard, later renamed Myths of the Norsemen (1960); the Arthurian legends in King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table (1953); the stories of Robin Hood in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1956); and even Tales from Shakespeare (1965). His works of original fiction include The Luck of Troy (1961), set during the Trojan War, and The Land of the Lord High Tiger (1958), a fantasy that has been compared to the Narnia books. There are some in the homeschool movement who have strong objections to reading and studying mythology, claiming that it gives credence to heathen idolatry. While I respect their sincere convictions, I do not necessarily agree with their conclusions. The fact that many ancient cultures worshipped false gods and the stories that they told about those false gods are part of the history of our world, and there are many aspects of our Western culture which are drawn from them. I am convinced that we can read and study about the pagan idol gods from a purely historical standpoint without honoring them in any way or being in danger of believing in them, and can even see from learning about them how much superior the one true God who is revealed to us in the Bible truly is. I did not find Green's Tales of Ancient Egypt to be awesome or inspiring, but I thought that they were interesting reading, and they do remind me how thankful I am that our universe is ruled over by a holy, just, reasonable, and orderly Lord rather than the hodge-podge of mystical, magical, mythical deities of ancient Egypt.",Wayne S.

9781421530543,"Yes, this manga (COMIC BOOK) is displayed right to left. That is because it was translated from Japanese and they write right to left. Every faithful manga is written like this - Naruto, DBZ, Bleach, etc. I read these as a child when I was 9 years old and I didn't struggle with them. You will get used to it, just google a guide to see how to do it. It's not as if the words are written backwards. The series is paneled very well for easy reading, the translations have been well done with no choppy English, and the illustrations are very nice. This follows RED and NOT Ash Ketchum from the TV shows as it is based on the game instead. The Pokemon illustrations are very interesting first off and this series is great for anyone who wants a bit of nostalgia, as well as new readers who want an insight into the origins of the series. A very good read - I would recommend this to any Pokemon fan.",Molly May
9781421530543,"First of all: The ''book'', since ins't a book, but a Manga, is in it's original form, so you have to read from right to left (it's not a big problem, you eventually will get used to it). Second: The book as nothing to do with the anime, or in other words, the ''cartoon'', it's based on the video games, and so, it's not that childish as people might thing, on the long run of the series, things as death and violence are referred, it's not that violent, but it's not that saint. So as for the first volume of Pokemon Adventures, it starts the Red/Green/Blue Arc (by Arc you can say Season), with 14 chapters, and it present's Red, a overconfident boy, that after losing to Blue (Green in the Japanese version), decides to pay a visit to Professor Oak, to become a better trainer, and with that he is entrusted with a pokedex and then starts is journey trough Kanto. Other key elements on the book is the Team Rocket appearance, Gym battles, and Pokemon that Red catches. As for the art style, it's a little childish but it's good and clean, easy to read. For the Pokemon Fans I highly recommend it.",Mathias de Oliveira Marques
9781421530543,"Pokemon Adventures Volume 1 In volume one Red, a trainer from Pallet town teams up with his long time friend Poliwhirl and newly given Bulbasaur to travel the Kanto region and try to complete the Pokedex. Along the way Red will have to face his rival Blue, deal with a disobedient Pikachu and battle with the evil Team Rocket. Though I don't like to compare the two the manga is a lot better than the anime. This is because the characters are a lot smarter and braver and this is evident many times during the series. I am really happy that they started doing this series again and now I have got up to volume 14. This volume introduces the main characters Red and Blue. Red is a very good character but Blue still need to be developed more and we will learn more about him during the next two volumes. The book is good for children and adults because of there are no bad scenes with bad violence or anything and there is a lot of action that adults would like.

Reynie was adopted by his dear tutor, Miss Perumal, Constance was adopted by Mr. Benedict himself, Kate was reunited with her long lost father, Milligan, and Sticky returned to his parents. Now Mr. Benedict has planned a special surprise for the children in honor of their one year anniversary and as a chance for the four friends to see each other again. Everything goes wrong when Mr. Benedict and one of his trusty companions, Number Two, go missing. The children know that this is the dastardly deed of Mr. Curtain, the same man that caused all of the trouble in the children's last story. With no other option, the children set off on yet another adventure, this time to save the man that they have come to love. With clues left by Mr. Benedict before he was captured and the aid of many friends, the children set off on a great journey in search for Mr. Benedict while being pursued by many of Mr. Curtain's henchmen. I really enjoyed this book. It definitely lived up to the first book and may have even surpassed it. The magic of the first book returned and I fell in love with the author's style. His choice of words was great and the character development in this book was much better. The only issue I had with this book is the pace wasn't consistent. I felt like at some points I was completely riveted to the book and couldn't put it down, but there were other times where I just couldn't get into the story. I really liked the way the characters came together in this book. They all had personality and were very likeable. I also loved the adventure the kids went on. They traveled the globe and I was able to learn quite a few things from their different adventures. Another great thing about this book is that it's not necessary to read the first book in the series. While there are a few pieces of information that aren't included, they're not crucial to the story and this book can totally stand on its own. While this was a middle grade novel, I think older readers will also enjoy it. I know I did. Overall, I really liked this book and I recommend it to you all.",TeensReadToo
9780789481917,"BROWNE, A. (1998). VOICES IN THE PARK. New York: DK Publishing, Inc. Anthony Brownes Voices in the park (1998) is contemporary realistic fiction, in the form of a picture book. On the surface this book is about a trip to the park, told from four different viewpoints. At a deeper level, Browne is highlighting the theme of socio-economic and personality differences. In typical Browne style, the heart of this book is its unique surreal artwork, providing a rich visual feast for the eyes. The voices referred to in the title belong to two families. There are Charles, his mother and ""Victoria, our pedigree Labrador""; and Smudge, her father and Albert - ""some scruffy mongrel"" to quote Charles' mother. Victoria and Albert hit it off from page two, much to Mother's annoyance. One striking picture shows Mother with her hat blown straight up off her head, the flowers standing up off her scarf and vectors drawing the eye to her. The reader is aligned with Smudge looking at Mother from a high angle close up view, emphasising Mother's superiority. (She's) 'aEURAfff'|really angry, the silly twit' thinks Smudge. Browne very effectively separates his characters in multiple ways. Each is introduced with a heading (First, Second, Third and Fourth Voice). A different font for each voice cleverly represents their characteristics of judgment, depression, oppression and cheerfulness. The characters are drawn as gorillas, whose wonderful expressions range from proud self-righteousness and alarm to sad longing and joy. They represent different seasons, shown visually through form, colour and shadow. A lamp post creates a stunning vector separating the elegance of Mothers world and the shabbiness of Dads. The same post later highlights Charles gloom and Smudges hope. Layout in this picture has the children at the bottom looking at each other, offering the viewer freedom to focus on the top. Charles landscape is overcast, with storm clouds and leafless trees. Smudges background depicts light, clear blue sky, leafy trees and a fairy tale castle. Although the illustrations appear simple, each visit becomes an adventure of exciting discovery. ""I know it's a waste of time but you've got to have some hope, haven't you?"" asks Dad as he reads the paper in search of a job, a picture of The Scream on the paper's cover echoing his despair. However ""Smudge cheered me up. She chattered happily to me all the way home."" The wall passed on their return journey is transformed from drab to warmly glowing by the lamp post, which is now a huge flower. More examples of intertextuality appear as Santa, previously begging by the wall is now dancing on his toes beside The laughing cavalier and Mona Lisa. The latter two, previously trapped, miserable and sitting in a puddle, have escaped their frames and are in each other's arms, dancing. One senses a feeling of victory, highlighted by King Kong's silhouette on top of the nearby high rise, its' dull grey windows transformed to bright yellow, green and red. The overall mood has changed from bleakness to joy. Voices in the park is a treasure for all age groups - the very young for the simple story and stunning illustrations, and for older readers the deeper meaning calling from each page. Anthony Browne has hit the mark with this book, which in his own words, ""leave[s] a gap that is filled by the reader's imaginationaEURAfff'|AffAff'C/EUR A book well worth reading again and again, Voices in the park is a valuable addition to any library.",Bev Collins
9781402217753,"Acquired: Borrowed a copy from the local library. Reason for Reading: I thought ds should be able to read this as his reader and I had read good reviews of how funny they were. First, we must get one thing straight. Henry is a horrid little boy. He is naughty, likes to cause trouble, is contrary on purpose, likes to make his perfect brother miserable and is never happy unless he gets his own way. Each book contains four short stories and in no way whatsoever does Henry ever learn a lesson, have things turn out bad for him or say he's sorry at the end. No, Henry may have things go not quite the way he planned at the beginning but they only turn out better than he had planned and in the end he gets what he wanted or even better. Henry is no role model, nor can we learn a life lesson from him BUT he is absolutely hilarious, laugh out loud funny. My son wants to read more books in the series and even if he didn't, I would read them on my own and I am way out of the 7 to 10 recommended age group! This is the first book written and so the first story simply introduces us to horrid Henry and his brother perfect Peter. Henry decides to try being perfect for a day to see what it is like and while he finds it irritating at times, he so confuses his parents and annoys his brother that Peter gets into trouble for a change and Henry can't stop laughing and ends up in his room as usual. Next Henry causes a ruckus at dance class; he'd rather go to karate lessons. Practicing to be a raindrop for Henry is more fun when he does his elephant dance and one thing leads to another until he's finally kicked out of dance class. Hopefully karate classes will now fill in the free time on Saturdays. Then Henry gets together with his neighbour Moody Margaret and the two of them end up in the kitchen making a disgusting, gloopy, gummy, greasy mess called Glop, which they've dared each other to eat. Finally, we end with a camping trip, but Henry's idea of a campground and that of his parent's vary from each other considerably. He wants to go where Moody Margaret's family goes: they have electricity, a pool, TVs, a fridge, a shower and more. Mom and Dad want to go back to nature. Let's just say that when Harry is finished with them, Mom and Dad may never want to be left alone with nature again! Hilarious! Ds did a good job of reading the book, too!

I've been wanting to buy this for so long just to have on my bookcase and here it is so that's great. My sister who can't stand reading, after much bribery from me, read this in about a week- and yelled at me because it made her cry (and she doesn't cry at just anything) and it helped to spark her love of reading. I just really love this book- I can't say that much more.

9780439636537,"Michael Morpurgo is an author who has written over 100 books for children and teens. Published in 2006, Private Peaceful was his 100th book. Recommended for grades 7 and up, Private Peaceful tells the story of Thomas Peaceful, an English teen during World War I who was too young to fight, but lied about his age to join the war effort. It is haunting the way this book draws the reader into Thomas's life both before and during World War I. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about his early years, his relationships with his family, his motivations. In the end we see just how devastating the war was on Thomas's friends and family. There is definitely an unexpected twist in the story, and it leaves you feeling sad. I don't want to go into more detail than that because I don't want to spoil the story (the twist is not what you might expect from a war book). Private Peaceful is an interesting read, but not really a feel-good one. I'd recommend it for the valuable reminder it gives us of the devastating effects of war, and as a memorial to those who gave up their childhood and their lives in World War I.",Katy F.

9780545433150,"3.75/5 stars It feels like so much happened! However, when I flipped back the pages, I realized that the events that took place occurred continuously and they weren't prolonged--which is good. On another note: the artwork is wonderful and lovely to look at. I know I kind of say this with almost all of Amulet novels, but it's true--they really are beautiful! ^.^ Some comments I have while reading: - Page 104-105: lovely portrayal of the hidden city! - Page 118: (last panel) really like the style & color scheme--reflecting of water, too - Page 166-167: stunning... - Page 177: ""Time can heal many wounds... Unless you work to disallow it. Because there are some memories you refuse to put away.""

9780545433150,"Finally book six arrives. It feels like a long wait for this volume and with two years between it would have benefitted from a basic ""the story so far"" blurb but I settled back into the story fairly quickly. The plot is piquing at this point and we have the first resolution within this intricate quest fantasy. The main characters have developed and progressed so much since we first met them. Kibuishi gives the story real emotion by allowing characters to perish in the act of duty or as inevitable retribution but we also see the return of characters set aside a few books ago which always brings delight when there is a lovable recurring cast. The art, as always with this series, is stunning and almost seems ready for big screen. Great addition to the middle grade quest fantasy series.",Nicola Mansfield

Although it is well written and I really enjoyed the plot, I must say that I was kind of disappointed with the ending ...I'm not gonna spoil it ,but I really hoped it would end differently ...

9780545208857,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. Finally, the year long wait is over and Book Three is here and well worth the wait is was! The Cloud Searchers is the best book in The Amulet series to date! Kibuishi keeps taking this story further and deepening the plot with each book. Much happens in Book 3 that brings the storyline to new heights. We learn some background of the world they are in, Alledia, and more about the stones and their powers and purposes. In this volume Emily and the gang are in search of the fabled lost city of Cielis, which some say may have taken to the skies to hide. Emily joins forces with a previous enemy, she looses two dear friends, she becomes more powerful and she finally learns what her purpose here is. Kibuishi's illustrations are, as usual, fantastic. I love the buildings, cities and towns he creates. His creatures and enemies are dark and scary and this volume has an overall dark and oppressive atmosphere with its colours ranging from greys to black. This suits the story very well. The author puts a few references to incidents from both previous volumes quickly here and there which a reader appreciates when there has been so much time since publication of Book One. I was excited from the first page! The only thing I'm concerned about is how long the wait will be until Book Four hits the shelves!",Nicola Mansfield

9780060097912,"Reason for Reading: My son read this as his reader while I was away on vacation and I promised I would read it too. I have read it before a few other times in the past. Stanley's original adventure never ceases to amuse me and any child I have read it to for the first time has always found a lot of fun within these pages. Yes, we can tell that the story is taking place in some that took place much earlier than our ""here and now"" and while contemporary when written it now adds a sense of vintage charm to the story. When things were simpler, when people were politer and when they sorted out their grievances right quick even if it did involve a push and a shove. The old-fashionedness didn't bother my son at all and I found it rather quaint. Stanley has fun adventures being flat; his brother Arthur is jealous at first but in the end Stanley just wants to be his regular self. A fun story that started ""The Flat Stanley Project"". The illustrations in this book are nice but they are not the originals which I will always prefer. Fun book for early chapterbook readers with several more in this series plus a couple of spin-off series.",Nicola Mansfield

9780064407052,"Quite literally, a 'charming' book. Fantasy is not my usual genre, but this book did seem so sweet. I'm happy to have read it now, but there are some things that disappointed me. Since birth, Ella was cursed by a fairy to always be obedient. Although it is good for growing children to obey their elders, a curse of obedience can be one's downfall. It definitely made an interesting plot to see how Ella would deal with following every command (even from her friends), and especially the commands that people didn't really mean for her to do, yet she had to struggle through anyways. I rather think that some parents may not like the attitude that Ella takes on; because she knows that she is cursed to obey every command, she literally wills herself not to obey, even for trivial tasks. I didn't exactly like the way that Ella balked at the tiny things, but I suppose that her challenging spirit had to be revealed somehow. Another point that disappointed me in the story is the twist that the author adds at the end. Basically, it is an exact retelling of the Cinderella story. I was quite dumbfounded that she didn't omit one detail, and copied the Cinderella story so precisely. I realize that the author was tying the two plots together, but it could have been done more discreetly with tact. Ella has good wits, a noble heart, and much creativity. Several times throughout the story she reminded me of the character Emily Byrd Starr from the 'Emily' novels, by L.M. Montgomery. If you like 'Ella Enchanted', then you should try the 'Emily' series.",Tarissa
9780064407052,"Ella of Frell is fifteen years old and lives with her father, Sir Peter, and mother Lady Eleanor, their cook Mandy, and other servants in the kingdom of Kyrria, ruled over by King Jerrold and Queen Daria, who are the parents of Prince Charmont (Char). At her birth, the foolish fairy Lucinda gave Ella the gift of obedience, but it turns out to be a curse because she must automatically obey every order given to her regardless of what it is, whether hopping on one foot for a day or even chopping off her own head. After Lady Eleanor dies, Sir Peter marries the odious Dame Olga, who has two equally odious daughters, Hattie and Olive. Then her father promptly leaves on a business trip. In the meantime, Ella and Char have fallen in love, but Ella knows that she can't marry him while under the curse, so she goes on a quest, encountering ogres and giants, in order to break the spell. Will she succeed? Or will the Prince find another bride? Ella Enchanted, which was a Newbery honor book in 1998, is Levine's take on the traditional Cinderella story, giving her own explanation of how the heroine came to have a wicked stepmother and stepsisters, ended up becoming a servant, and is finally chosen by the Prince. One could see the book as making fun of the traditional vows of brides to ""love, honor, and obey"" their husbands. Or one could view it simply as showing that obedience doesn't, or shouldn't, necessarily reduce a person to mere chattel slavery. Each reader will have to decide that for himself. There are references to drinking wine, brandy, and ale. And, of course, whenever you have princely balls, you are going to have mention of dancing. In 2006, Levine went on to write Fairest, a retelling of the Snow White story, set in the same world as Ella Enchanted. The plot of Ella is presented in an interesting way, though it will probably appeal much more to little ""princesses"" rather than little ""princes."" It is easy to read, and I basically enjoyed it, but like several others, I thought the book really couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a hip ""modern day fairy tale"" or a traditional medieval-type story. It seems to bounce back and forth almost willy-nilly between the two moods. While it is not a bad book, I have to wonder why it was chosen for a Newbery Honor award. The reason is probably that, as one reviewer called it an ""examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales,"" it presents ""a spunky, intelligent female lead"" that is quite in tune with the modern feminist ideal. A movie was made in 2004 that was very loosely based on the book, and some people expressed the opinion that the film was less disjointed and confusing than the novel, though it is quite different in many respects.",Wayne S.

9780439443838,"You can always tell when you're reading a book that has a basis in truth. With RULES, author Cynthia Lord writes about what it's like to live with autism, and she should know, since she has an autistic child. That ring of truth is there, in every word, when you read the story of twelve-year old Catherine and her autistic younger brother, David.David hates loud noises. If there's a cloud in the sky, he has to take his red umbrella with him. If his dad says he'll be home at five o'clock, David starts going crazy at five-oh-one. He likes to rewind his movie of Thomas the Tank Engine to his favorite part, over and over and over again. His favorite place to visit is the video store, where he'll even lay on the floor to read the back of the movie box a stranger is holding in his hand. And he knows all the words to Arnold Lobel's FROG AND TOAD. For Catherine, though, it's a much different story. She hates the way people stare at her brother, or even worse, refuse to look at him at all. She's jealous of the time David gets to spend, one-on-one, with their pharmacist father. She hates David's rules, the strict adherence to which he is obsessed with them, and yet she makes new rules for him every time she thinks of something else he needs to know. Catherine copes by drawing, and one day she decides to draw the boy in the wheelchair who is in the waiting room with her at Occupational Therapy. David goes there once a week to work with a therapist, and so does the boy who doesn't speak but instead uses a book of word cards to communicate. When Catherine offers to make Jason, the boy in the wheelchair, some new cards with pictures, an unlikely friendship is born. Catherine is also excited about Kristi, her new next-door neighbor, but soon finds out that friendship is a complicated matter. How do you protect a brother that often annoys you? How can you be friends with the beautiful girl next door and yet be ashamed to admit your friend Jason doesn't talk and is in a wheelchair? How do you make your father understand that you matter, too? How do you tell your mother that even though David needs his own words, Frog and Toad is a special communication between a brother and sister that love each other? RULES isn't just a book about autism, but rather a look into the complexities of a family relationship. An excellent read for anyone who has ever had to deal with someone who is just a little bit different than everyone else.",TeensReadToo

9780007489442,"Hilarious and entertaining. Geek Girl is perfect for light and laid-back reading. Who says you can't be a geek and a model at the same time? Harriet Manners is a geek and she's proud of it. She's randomly spewing out facts and trivia and while some people find it awkward and/or annoying, for me it's cute and spontaneous. Aside from being smart, she's also funny as hell. It's not like she's trying to be funny, though. She's just so clueless half the time that things tend to catch her off guard, hence making her do funny things. So imagine what happens when she gets spotted by a modelling agency and offered a modelling gig. Speaking of funny, there's no shortage of hilarious characters in Geek Girl. Toby, Natalie, Wilbur, Harriet's dad, Nick ????????????????????????????????????C/?? these people crack me up. Really colorful characters that complimented well with Harriet's personality. And I think that it's a good thing that the story was told from Harriet's perspective because all these amazing characters would have outshone her otherwise. But my favorite character in this book is Annabel. She may not be Harriet's biological mother but she's very protective and takes care of her the way a real mother would have. She's stern and strict but underneath all that lawyer facade, she has a soft heart. I thought at first that she's the typical stepmother who doesn't get along well with her stepkids, but it was a relief to know that she's different from the stereotype. It also helps that she has a good sense of humor. Aside from the characters, I also liked the story and the way it was written. As I've mentioned, Geek Girl is a light and funny read. It's a perfect breather in between those heavy and intense books I've been reading lately. The character development is good, too. Though the story revolves around Harriet being a reluctant model and there's not much going on apart from her almost-transition, there's a little lesson to be learned here. Harriet may have made selfish decisions but she stayed true to herself all throughout. And she also learned her lesson in the end and tried to make up for her mistakes. That's what I liked most about her. I also love the ending because Nick! ASDFGHJKL! Gods, that boy made me swoon every time he showed up. I wish there's more of Harriet and Nick in the next books. ????????????????????????????????????C/?????????????????????????????????????Y= ????????????????????????????????????C/?????????????????????????????????????Y= ????????????????????????????????????C/?????????????????????????????????????Y=",Julie Rimpula
9780007489442,"To celebrate Geek Girl: Picture Perfect by Holly Smale coming out in 4 days, I am going to re-read the Geek Girl series again then review them! To tell you the truth, I am so sleepy. I stayed up all night reading Geek Girl. And I finished reading it so yay! After this, I'm going to re-read Geek Girl: Model Misfit. Again. Then I have to go to the nearest bookstore and buy Geek Girl: Picture Perfect. Then review that...let's just get on with it before I turn 20. My favorite thing about Geek Girl is that I could relate to Harriet in every way and everything she does. (Except, you know, the whole becoming a model bit.) Her humor and casualty towards the reader right from the start invites and reels me in so much that I read every. Single. Word. Not like other books where I sometimes skim through the unimportant parts. This is actually the first book this year that I've read every single word in it, if you know what I mean. Although, the book was a very fast read compared to the width of the book. It's either I read really fast or the words are just too big. But it's the inside that counts, right? And the inside is phenomenal! Full of humor, drama and embarrassing dads! The perfect read for anyone who wants to have a laugh! Storyline is ah-mazing. Simple, typical lying-to-others problems but very effective and is very harmonized with the other problems and main storyline. The characters seemed fairly similar to each other, especially Wilbur (bur not iam) and Harriet's dad. They both kind of have a similar sense of humor but Wilbur is more enthusiastic than Dad, whose sense of humor embarrasses Harriet and himself. The other characters though were very unexpected I guess you could say. Like how Yuka Ito, shockingly, at the end of Geek Girl, was happy that Harriet told the truth and Yuka didn't explode! And how Yuka and Nick are actually related! That was the most shocking event of all. I'm not a really big fan of the cover. It didn't really catch me and neither did the blurb. So I had to read 4 chapters before I said, ""Okay. I'll give it a try."" and I made the right decision because this book is remarkable! I hope the second book isn't second rated like some series. In a few series (not a lot), the first book would be EPIC! and the second book would be PRETTY GOOD! then the third (if there is) would be like ...Can I re-write this? Please? I loved that the chapters were very short from 2 to about 10 pages. This helped because I hate memorizing page numbers and I also hate folding the corners so remembering the chapter number is so much easier. To make that clear, I lost my four bookmarks somewhere around the world (Two in the Philippines, one in Japan and another in Sydney, Australia) and I couldn't be bothered to buy another. In the end, I gave it 5 stars because I just couldn't put the book down! It was very compelling. This book would definitely not waste a single penny. (Or cent.)

9780007489442,"Geek Girl is one of those books that I pick up when I'm in a certain mood. It's a light, fluffy contemporary with a certain escapism appeal. And in that sense, it's so great to read - as long as I don't start qualitatively analyzing it. This book has a lot going for it. As a raging nerd and geek myself, I definitely connected with Harriet on many points. I think in a way that a lot of people don't understand - and while I don't collect random facts and spew them out all the time, it was definitely enjoyable to read from that point of view. Harriet is just amazingly awkward but in a very relatable and touching way. However, I must say, that toward the end of the book, her personality - the awkward exclamations of facts and the constant self-deprecation - got exhausting. I desperately wanted her to grow, at least from the self-deprecation stuff. I mean, this girl is picked out of nowhere to be a model, swept into the modeling world, and is an instant sensation. Meanwhile, she will tell you every moment she gets that she is so ugly that it makes no sense why they picked her. I mean, a little self-doubt is understandable, particularly as a teenager. But it felt overdone here. She wouldn't entertain the notion that maybe some people thought she was pretty for a second. And not only did that kind of make me lose respect for her, it also made me believe her. At the end of the book, I was just nodding going, ""Yeah, I dunno why they picked you either. I mean, gosh. Ugly."" Yeah, I don't really care much for books that make me so rude. I did, however, enjoy her budding romance with Nick. I thought they were adorable together, and though I suppose it leaned a little towards instalove, that actually didn't bother me at all. Particular the end was just.. all the adorbs! I loved it! And that will probably have me picking up the sequel anyway. The rest of the novel was more or less middle-of-the-road stuff. It was a nice pick-me-up, and it had some nice moments, like Harriet's relationship with her stepmother, Annabeth, and her father and Annabeth's relationship. However, there were also some moments that were completely exhausting: like Wilbur, the eccentric agent who picks up Harriet and all his *headdesk*-worthy nicknames. Also, Toby, the geek who openly stalks Harriet kind of freaked me the hell out when I really thought about his behavior. At first glance he was kind of cute-nerdy, but he really stalks Harriet, and she is perfectly okay with it. That's just something I can't really comprehend. The plot was straightforward and unsurprisingly. Exactly what you would expect from such a contemporary escapism read. I could have done with less best friend drama and stuck up model drama, but I guess if you pick this book up, you're probably someone who doesn't mind that kind of thing. Summing Up... What can I say? No big surprises in this book. What you see is what you get. When you have nothing else to read and really just want something light and cute to pick you up, consider Geek Girl. It's pretty fun. But don't expect to be wowed. The romance may be its biggest selling point though, and that definitely has me curious for the sequel, Model Misfit. But it's not really on the priority list. Recommended To... Geeky readers in the mood for a light, pick-me-up read.",Unknown
9780007489442,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Harper Collins UK and Netgalley.) 15-year-old Harriet is a geek, and she knows it. The last thing she expects on a class trip to see 'The Clothes Show' is to be spotted by an agent from a model agency, especially as being a model has been her best friends dream for as long as she can remember. Harriet is sick of being laughed at though. She wants things to change, and becoming a model might just be a big enough change to really shake things up. Harriet's step-mum is not happy about it though, and forbids Harriet from going ahead, but Harriet's dad has other plans, and together they try to fool everyone. How long can Harriet keep her new career a secret? What will Harriet's best friend say when she finds out? And what are the creative team going to do with Harriet's hair? This was a fun read, with Harriet's quirky ways, and the model agent's strange mannerisms. The agent - Wilbur is quite silly and amusing, and calls people really random things like 'my little tortoise' and 'alienduck' (which is apparently 'the ginger child of an alien and duck union'). Harriet's dad is also prone to saying some ridiculous things at times! I like the addition of the male model - Nick, and Harriet's nervousness around him due to her crush, and the fashion designer with her strange requests. I liked the storyline and scene setting, I could totally imagine the Russia shoot being on 'America's Next Top Model', and it was also refreshing to read a book that was set in the UK! Overall; a fun YA novel about becoming a model. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780007489442,"Every one in a while, I like a nice, cute read that makes me giggle occasionally. This book certainly made me smile and made me feel all fuzzy inside with all its talk of not being afraid to be who you are or not changing for everybody else's benefit. From the very first page I fell in love with Harriet's personality. She's really bubbly and charismatic with the way she would come out with facts nobody would ever think they need to know and how she just happens to be the clumsiest person ever. I also loved how she would interact with all of the other characters, especially Nick. As soon as Nick left the picture I would be rushing to turn the pages, impatiently waiting for him to reappear. I thought Nat and Toby were really great supporting characters. Toby just made me laugh outright with his obsession with Harriet - he was the funniest stalker ever and I mean that in the best way possible. Nat, however, was really well written. I thought she did everything that a best friend is supposed to. I really hate books where best friends are just there for another character to 'hang out with'. They serve no purpose. But Harriet and Nat reminded me of myself and my own best friend. We fight when we disagree - that's the reality of it - but we make each other better people for it and we know that when we do get into an argument, we're fine the day after. As for the plot, I thought it was a general feel good story. A girl has her problems, insecurities and the like, she faces even more problems when she tries to resolve the initial hardships and then comes out better for it in the end. It's not one of those really complicated plots where you have no idea what's going to happen. I knew what was going to happen and how the book would end from the beginning but I enjoyed it nevertheless. Overall, I thought this was a great read for anybody who likes a sweet story once in a while. I would definitely recommend it - if nothing else, I can guarantee it will make you laugh at the very least.",Maryam H

He helps his family by working with their crops of hay, selling the potatoes, hoeing carrots, planting corn & pumpkins, and picking berries. He learns how to do everything else on the farm too, like dealing with the sheep & pigs, to training the young oxen & horses, to gathering the sap from the trees. Almanzo also does things that other children do, like going to school, or sledding on a winter day, and sometimes he gets in trouble, whether he's in it by himself or with his older brother & sisters. There's usually something exciting going on, like the County Fair, or a holiday like Independence Day. When Mother & Father leave for a few days, what do you think the children do in their absence? He's a hungry growing boy and it seems that the Wilder's table is always overflowing with good home-cooked food, so there's plenty, even for Almanzo's very large appetite. ""Farmer Boy"" is the third book in the ""Little House"" series, but since Almanzo's story isn't connected to the other stories in the series, you can read this book at any time, even if you haven't read any of the other books. A few years ago, my family read this book aloud, and I've read it again myself since then. I enjoy reading the ""Little House"" books, and this one is a definite favorite.

9780142417225,"I thought my 9-yr old would like this, based upon reviews. She loves Nancy Drew, which features an 18-yr old. But not only is this a really tedious read, I had to give up reading it at the description of the murder about 5 chapters in (pp60-61). Too graphic (references to the effect of occluding the carotid artery in the prosecution's opening statement). Horrible. The mentioning of ""no history of drug abuse"" should also not be aimed at children. My daughter had already given up during chapter one, but I said ""it will get better and more interesting"". I was wrong for page after page of irrelevant page-filling detail. Grisham is full of himself in adult fiction, which I actually quite like, but this is not suitable for younger children despite what some reviewers say. Murder is not a nice crime with which to begin a series. Legal stuff is really quite boring. Enough said.",Graham Lees

The strangeness of being stuck in a world so different from the one in your head, as well as pain of losing someone dear to you are vividly brought out in Erskine's authentic storytelling that makes me feel as if I'm standing there right next to Caitlin, seeing things with her eyes.

Before I read the synopsis and remembered one characther in To Kill A Mockingbirf, I would never know that Calpurnia was a name of a girl. It was too weird for me. I would love to question her parents for the reason. Particularly same thought was in Callie's mind. Lucky us, her grandfather had the answer As stated in the synopsis, the Whole story took a place in Fentress, Texas 1899 during summer till the beginning of winter. I have no pictures but all scenes in The Little House on Prairie. From their dress, school, even the horse cart. It helped me a lot to get what Callie try to describe. Thanks to the translator. It was easy for me to connect with this smart young girl who could not stop observing something. She was not another ordinary girl. She was not interested in kniting or cooking. I enjoyed all her words and felt amazed with her thoughts. She had many ways to make me giggle with it. I felt something missing when I was in the last page of this delightful novel and found there was no more to read. What I also loved from this book with 28 chapters inside was the paragraph that told me Callie's relationship with older and younger brothers. Most of them were so touching. I was looking forward to read it in every chapters. Not only with her brothers, but ""quality time"" with her mother was also counted. I was completely entertained and laughed couple of times reading those parts. Her mother could read Callie's mind easily. That might what people called as mother's instinct. Callie and also all her brothers had no option but obeyed all her rules. Actually I really want to give 5 but 4 stars is enough.

9780064407663,"After already having seen the movie, I decided to invest in reading the books. Bk #1, THE BAD BEGINNING, only took me an hour to finish, and it was an enjoyable--if dark--read. The Baudelaire children--Violet, Klaus, and Sunny--are left orphaned after a mysterious fire destroys their home and kills their parents. Taken into custody by Mr. Poe, the executor of their parent's estate, they learn that their parent's will states that they must be cared for by a relative. The closest relative, unbeknownest to the children, is Count Olaf, an actor and leader of a theatre troupe who lives in a dilapitated house on the other side of town. Things, of course, only go from bad to worse after the children move into Count Olaf's home, which is strangely covered inside and out with drawings and representations of a strange-looking eye. Count Olaf even has a tattoo of the same image on his ankle. As the Count hatches a scheme to gain control of the Baudelaire fortune, which the children are not privy to until Violet comes of age, the children are alternately scared of their new ""parent"" and determined to find a way out of their dreadful situation. I enjoyed this walk on the dark side, and plan on reading Book #2 in the series later today. That said, however, I think it depends on your child and his or her maturity as to whether this would be a good read for them or not. Although the reading material is suitable for around 8 years old and up, the book IS dark-natured, and might scare some children. If they've already seen the movie, they might be prepared for its darkness--if the movie depiction scared them, then hold off on the book for awhile.",TeensReadToo
9780807508527,"Reason for Reading: This is another book from the Random Bookshelf that I am reading from this year.The Boxcar Children have played a big part in my and my children's lives. I intend to acquire a complete set of the first 19 books (the others hold no interest to me) and keep them as keepers on my juvenile shelves for my future grandchildren. When I read these books from the library is the mid '70s, they were hardcover's with picture boards and I was entranced with them. I'd always go over an pick one out to read whether I'd read it before or not. For my oldest son, who was a very young, strong reader, these were his first chapter books that he read for his own personal pleasure. Due to my business as a used book dealer at the time of his childhood, we went to a lot of garage sales on Saturdays and he would always take a Boxcar Children book with him in the car and have it finished before we'd finished garage sailing. He had a huge collection of all the newer books and super specials, etc. For my younger son, these were his first chapter book read alouds and he loved him so much. I think he and his dad read about 8 of them when he was about five. Now having just re-read this one again I'm fairly confident he could read it himself so I'm going to set it aside for him and let him have a go in the near future. Although the books in this series always have a mystery to solve, this first book does not really have a mystery other than the children themselves. Orphans who have runaway because they don't want to stay with a mean, old grandfather they've never met. They stumble across an old boxcar and set up house in there, which is a lot of fun seeing how these children work so diligently to create a simple home for themselves. The writing style throughout the series is also very high interest while keeping to a simple 3rd grade reading level. I honestly can't remember the stories of any of the other books offhand but I do especially love this first book as it is the only one of the series to be illustrated by L. Kate Deal in stunning silhouette art. One can tell the story takes place long ago with the girls in dresses and kerchiefs and the boys in short pants and long stockings but the darkness and absence of detail leave much to the imagination. Even if you have no intention on reading the series as a whole, ""The Boxcar Children"" itself is a modern classic to be enjoyed by all.",Nicola Mansfield
9780062194817,"I 100% loved this! Having read the novel way back in 2008 it's impossible for me to say whether this deviates at all from the original but it certainly brings the fantastic story back to into my life! An incredible story that is so imaginative. It's a brilliant story and I just wonder what took them so long to adapt it to graphic novel form especially considering the authors. The only thing a little iffy here is that each chapter is illustrated by a different artist so there is some transition adjustment as characters will look slightly different and personally I liked some styles better than others, but overall they did a very good job of keeping consistent with one another and yet staying true to their own form. P. Craig Russell is so wonderful an artist though it certainly would have been brilliant had the entire book been done by him, just saying.",Nicola Mansfield
9781419706424,"First there was the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, said to be a realistic fiction novel, by Jeff Kinney, which appeared on FunBrain.com in 2004 and was released in hardcover on April 1, 2007. Next, there have been several sequels, including Rodrick Rules (2008), The Last Straw (2009), Dog Days (2009), The Ugly Truth (2010), the only one that I have read, and Cabin Fever (2011). The seventh, The Third Wheel, is scheduled for release on November 13, 2012. Then there was a Diary of a Wimpy Kid film that was released by 20th Century Fox on March 19, 2010. After that, there were two more movies, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, based on book two of the Wimpy Kid series in 2011, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days based on books three and four in 2012. Now, there is a tie-in book, written by Kinney, called The Wimpy Kid Movie Diary. It was originally published in 2010 and included film stills, script pages, storyboards, preliminary concept drawings, some new illustrations, and also behind the scenes information to chronicle in a humorous way the making of the film. The latest edition gives the story of all three movies. It begins with some background information about the original book, explains how it was made into a film, and then tells about the two movie sequels. Though the books, which chronicle in diary form how Greg Heffley relates to his dad Frank Heffley, his mom Susan Heffley, his older brother Rodrick, his little brother Manny, his best friend Rowley Jefferson, other kids at school, and people in the neighborhood, have been highly praised and very popular, I must be honest and say that they do not hit my hot button at all.

There is just SO much that the movie leaves out (shocker)... ...so even though this is not really my favorite of the series, I still absolutely enjoyed re-reading it; it is quite action-packed, and there is much more intrigue than in the movie, since the movie dumbs down a lot of the mystery for everyone by throwing hints around that just do not exist in the book. I also still cry like an idiot when I get to the graveyard scene. Every. Time. If you have read this, I'm sure you understand why. If you haven't read it, but have seen the movie, I guess you might have an idea, but you really should read the book, because the entire story makes so much more sense in the way Rowling actually wrote it rather than how it was adapted for the screen, and the continued world-building is so much more rich as well...""

9780316176194,"""The Extraordinary Education of Nicholas Benedict"" makes an excellent example of creativity and ingenuity in an author's writing style. This book is actually the prequel to the ""Mysterious Benedict Society"" trilogy. You really must read the trilogy first, in order to catch all the little details hidden in the prequel. While we've so enjoyed the adventures and quests of Reynie, Kate, Sticky and Constance who form the Society --- and all of whom are very bright children that Mr. Benedict cultivates --- we finally get the chance to meet the boy himself, young Nicholas Benedict. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ""Shall I tell you what I'm thinking, Mrs. Ferrier?""

The entire back-story is finally revealed in a truly ""extraordinary"" way. Young Nicholas is a nine-year-old boy with a mind that works overtime. Sometimes it's a great asset, and sometimes he finds himself in trouble because of it. He's always thinking, reading, and trying to figure out the next puzzle of life. Starting over at yet another orphanage is always hard, but that's exactly where he's going... Rothschild's End, the place where he will find friendship, enemies with the Spiders, and an unexpected treasure hunt.

It appealed to me on so many levels... the charm of a long-ago childhood, the love of libraries and books, the dreary orphanage holding so much potential within its walls, the wit found in tricky puzzles and clues, and the one boy who sees everything differently and can change it all. Complete with a few surprise twists now and then, to make sure you're awake. By the time I arrived at the last chapter, I felt so sad that I would have to finish it and part company with the characters within its pages. It's a book to laugh and cry over.

9780763631208,"Once again I find it a bit daunting to write a review of what is arguably one of the most well-known classic stories. I, like most people I know, grew up with Scrooge (although the form has changed). From Donald Duck to Jim Carrey, I've listened to the story of the grumpy, old, miserly man and his miraculous change of heart on one fateful Christmas Eve. My aunt actually ordered A Christmas Carol for her kindle and I saw the email and thought - oh, that would make a great read-along book for December. Perfect season, I've never read it.. but oh.. it's DICKENS. I don't know about you, but just the name Dickens is enough to strike fear deep into my heart. I struggled so much with A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield back in the day that, although interested to see how the book was, I approached this story with not a little bit of trepidation. It also helped to know it was short. I'll admit it. For those of you who haven't read the book, let me just say - put aside everything you know about Dickens from his other works and give this one a shot. It's remarkably easy to understand and, although he can go on, due to the shortness of the book as a whole, the descriptions don't get too much out of hand. There were quite a few things in the book that surprised me - details that really rounded out the story much more than the movies ever have. I regret that I've let all these years go by without establishing the reading of this story as atradition for myself, but it is something I intend to change in the upcoming years.",Lydia Presley

9780545141024,"Reason for Reading: I plan on reading ""Bone"" the graphic series this year, I've read one, just received the first 3 in the mail. And the idea of a new Bone story in chapter book form was intriguing. Plus I love Jeff Smith's illustrations. So, as I've said I'm new to the Bone universe only having read one book at the time of this review, ""Tall Tales"". I loved it and I know for purest of the series it's not exactly known for being one of the best of the series. So I know I'm in for a treat. That said, no previous knowledge of Bone is needed for this knew chapter book series. The very little background info I had was explained anyway, such as ""what is a rat creature?"" Tom Elm, is a turnip farmer's son who one day found a bit of interesting rock in the biggest turnip they ever grew. He has kept it hung around his neck as a good luck charm ever since, not that it's brought him any luck. Tom has lately been having horrible nightmares filled with darkness and shadows in which he is being smothered and drowned and one night the stone shines and saves his life. This is when he and his adopted brother Roderick the Raccoon are told about the terrible evil going on which is invading both the Dreaming and the Waking World, which will continue until it has squelched out the entire world in evil blackness. Tom has been chosen to find other fragments of the Spark (one of which he already has around his neck) and defeat the evil. In this particular book Tom has visions of him being in a group of eight people setting off for this quest. So following the Sparks visions he and Roderick set off to collect the other six. In the meantime the whole book follows the exploits of all the members of the soon-to-be group of questers as they go about there business. Other than Tom & Randolph, we have a Bone family of Percival F. Bone Explorer Extraordinaire and his two charges Abbey & Barclay who are setting off to find this valley that the Bone cousins have talked about. Then there is a former Veni Yan warrior who is a shell of his former self since his adventures left his wife and children home alone to be killed and now he is a drunk who tells tales of the glory days in exchange for drinks. Finally, and shocking to all other members, the Dreaming insists that two Rat Creatures who are being hunted down by their king for waking him up while stealing his dinner, have also been chosen to be a part of this quest. The book was a lot of fun. Typical quest fantasy, with a motley crew of creatures found in the world. Tom Elm is a good leader/hero for the group. He doesn't want to be a leader and though he's always dreamt of being a hero one day, the reality of it isn't so much fun. But he's been given the power of the Visions and at first reluctantly and later accepts that he has been given an important job to do and he'd better do it right. He's a humble fellow, but when following the Visions, the others mostly older than him follow quietly as they all know the wisdom of the Dreaming. A fun story with lots of humour, but also quite a dark story, hence my 10+ age recommendation. Intense and scary scenes may frighten some younger children. I know my sensitive son is going to be covering his eyes at the intense bits but I think he'll get through OK and will really enjoy it. There is one Smith illustration per chapter, but some chapters are longish so it made me wish there were more illustrations. There were certain scenes I would have loved to have seen illustrated but it must be tough to pick only one scene to illustrate from a whole chapter. I did catch a blooper in one illustration though. On page 159, when the tree grows out through the middle of the building all of our good guys are watching on one side, but wait a minute Abbey and Barclay are there too. They are not supposed to be, because at that exact moment in time they are up in the sky driving the airship ""Queen of the Sky"" hopefully coming to the others rescue! Oops. Looking forward to the next book in the series as the Quest really gets going, now that we have all the members gathered together.",Nicola Mansfield

It was scheduled to be demolished the next day, but Griffin hoped to use the sleepover as a protest of sorts. He was very disappointed that only his best friend, Ben, showed up. A group of the kids had the idea that the city could build a skate park on the property when the creepy old house was torn down, but the city officials had other ideas. They thought a museum was a better idea. Griffin had organized the sleepover hoping to get the attention their plan deserved. Instead, all he got was a night in his sleeping bag listening to his friend Ben snore. Before leaving the old house, the boys did a little exploring. Griffin accidentally discovered a secret drawer, and tucked in that drawer was a card - an old baseball card with a picture of Babe Ruth. He was sure it was valuable and would help solve his parents' financial problems. After a narrow escape from the wrecking ball, Griffin and Ben hurry to Palomino's Emporium of Collectibles and Memorabilia to get the opinion of an expert. Much to their disappointment, S. Wendell Palomino gives them bad news. The card is a reproduction and worth very little. He offers them $120, and they take the money and run. Imagine their surprise and fury when the nightly news is carrying the story of one S. Wendell Palomino and his incredible discovery of a valuable baseball trading card valued at $1,000,000.

And when we learn a new name for God, we learn something new about him, too! This book is for you and your children to read together. Every chapter teaches something new and helps put you-and your children-on the right track in your relationship with God. God has left his names with his people so they can know him . . . and through these pages your children can know him too. ""What's in a name? For most of us, not very much. We choose a name for a child because we like the sound of it, because it reminds us of someone we love, or because it is part of our family heritage. But for God, a name is not merely a word he assigns to himself; rather it is a description of who he is. Gods names tell us of his character, of his work, of his very essence. As we seek to introduce our children to this God, we do well to introduce him by name.

Nancy's imagination makes the six children into Arctic explorers and they begin planning a trip to the North Pole. Nancy, however, is laid low with Mumps - a mixed blessing, because on one hand she is ruled out of their fun; but on the other, they remain for an additional month by the lake. This book sees the introduction of Dick and Dorothea, two new children who become befriended by the Swallows and Amazons. Dick is the original absent-minded-professor, though he occasionally surprises the others with the practical outcomes from his inquiring mind. His sailing sledge is even better than John's. Dorothea, on the other hand, is the focus of much of the narrative. She is a creative dreamer and storyteller, rather like Titty in many ways, although she wants to be a novelist whereas Titty's imagination creates fantasies for her to actually live in.

Her father, the head curator, and her mother, an archaeologist who makes frequent trips to Egypt to acquire new artifacts, don't understand why their daughter continues to give them protective amulets, or at least get them to wear gloves when handling cursed objects! Good thing Theo's a smart girl; she takes it upon herself to find ways to un-curse the things her parents bring back to the museum, learning how to read hieroglyphics and perusing old papyrus documents about the legends and myths of ancient Egypt. She's not perfect--sometimes her solutions go awry, as when she accidentally transfers a curse to her pet cat, Isis--but her skills keep the museum in good order, leaving her parents none the wiser. Things start to get bad when Theo's mother comes back from Egypt with a new artifact: the Heart of Egypt, a legendary object that carries with it a curse that could destroy all of Britain and plunge the world into chaos. When the Heart of Egypt is stolen from the museum before Theo can work out a way to dispel the curse, she's sent on a wild chase through London. With the help of her younger brother, Henry, and a young pickpocket, Sticky Will, Theo organizes a plan to find the Heart of Egypt and steal it back. Theo is an innovative and interesting young girl, and her first-person narration is full of spunk and energy that shapes her character. The narrative voice was easily my favorite part of the storytelling; Theo's narration was compelling, really showing the world through her eyes. The supporting cast--heroes and villains alike--is rendered in great detail, so hat even those characters who might seem larger-than-life are just right for their setting. LaFevers paints a wonderful picture of 1906 London, with nods to the geopolitical tensions rocking Europe at that point, delivered through the perspective of a young girl who cares more for curses than for politics. The plot moves along at a good pace, spending just enough time on each scene that the reader gets a sense of being there, all of which is only emphasized by the voice of the novel's protagonist.

9780781403801,"Another wonderful wholesome book of stories about Grandma's memories of when she was a little girl on the farm back in the late 1800s in Michigan. Her age is not mentioned often this time around but six and nine years old are mentioned, with the majority of the stories taking place with her best friend Sarah Jane at around the age of nine. This makes the time frame compatible with book one. The short prelude stories of Grandma and Arleta have become a bit more involved and Arleta herself has become a character. The stories are just as fun as in book one, though all are not just fun, some have a more serious side as well. I'd say the stories this time around focus more on learning a lesson (though by no means are they didactic) and this book is definitely more from a Christian world view than the first. This time around Grandma and Arleta are staying at Grandma's old farm house for several months, this is where Uncle Roy lives now, and Arleta will be going to school here for a time.

9780807593660,"Reason for Reading: This is part of my Random Bookshelf Reading project. I'm also working on re-reading this series and collecting the first 19. Yellow House follows the established pattern of the first two books and yet also branches out a bit. The children go back to Surprise Island and end up on an adventure that has them roughing it and living outdoors, camping, canoeing and taking care of themselves, as usual. The children are a bit older this time with both Henry and Jessie in high school, Violet 12 and Benny 7, making the book suitable for a wide range of ages at the time it was written. The new character picked up in the last book joins in as an important member of the cast of characters. Yellow House is the first time the series really brings us a mystery, as the first two really only dealt with mysterious people, whose identities the children figured out by the end of the book, though others knew the secret. This time somewhat in the same vein but still different we have a missing persons case and the children find clues and search out the long lost person. For an adult the mystery is weak and unbelievable but as a first introduction to the genre it is a fun romp and I have to admit to thoroughly enjoying myself with the read. The amiable, well-mannered children of yester-year who love to play outside are a breath of fresh air themselves. Both my boys enjoyed these books so I know they are still appealing to today's kids and I think it's because of the freedom the Alden children have to wander far and wide in the outdoors with minimum adult supervision; something virtually unknown to this generation in today's modern world. This book also brings about the first time the children refer to themselves as the ""Boxcar Children"". The book concludes with another addition to the Alden family household and I think we probably have our full cast of regular characters set for further novels.

As punishment, Li Lun must plant the rice and grow seven times as many grains as he was given. From the wise man Sun Ling he learns that it will take him four moon changes or 120 days to grow the rice. But Sun Ling also reminds him, ""There are other things than fishing."" Other boys of the village taunt Li Lun, but with his supplies, including a satchel of food prepared by his mother, he trudges up the mountain to brave the gulls, the rats, the wind, the rain, the sun, and his own loneliness. Will he succeed in his goal? Can Li Lun prove to be a lad of courage? This book won a Newbery Honor Award in 1948. There are references to traditional Chinese beliefs in ""spirits,"" but in general the story illustrates not only courage but also love, respect, adventure, hardship, and perseverance. One ""professional"" reviewer called it a ""Flat story that contains little drama or excitement,"" saying, ""The boy's extraordinary accomplishment and sacrifice sounds understated to modern ears. It almost reads like child abuse."" One may not appreciate the father's reaction, but children need to learn that life isn't always fair, and we must be careful not to judge all the practices of other cultures from the past, and the literature which records them, by our modern sensibilities. Li Lun, Lad of Courage, though it may have little excitement, at least to kids raised on Star Wars, still exhibits a good deal of drama, and is a wonderful look into life in old China. It would make a great fictional complement to a study of Chinese history.",Wayne S. Walker
9780385348645,"Having never read Nutcracker and having never seen the ballet, I wanted to pick this one up for a new holiday read. If you are unfamiliar with the story as I was, it focuses on a little girl and the story behind a nutcracker that is given to her family during Christmas. The story features more violence than I would have imagined, with the rat family threatening multiple people, war, and horrible spells. It also features a land made up of candy items and candy is featured prominently in the story. With so many different candy's making up buildings and areas it made me think of the board game Candy Land and of Willy Wonka. The story is interesting and far fetched, just as a children's fantasy should be. While I think that the book may not hold interest for the littlest of kids (there are many words that I had to look up), older kids will like the fantasy element, the toys that come to life and the rhyming that shows up from time to time. The artwork is very recognizable as Maurice Sendak (Where The Wild Things Are), his style is evident in each illustration. I even noticed a Wild Thing poking out in one piece. Fans of his artwork will be delighted to see more in this book. The story was much longer than I expected, I didn't realize there was that much to Nutcracker, so this isn't a read aloud in 30 minutes kind of book, but one that will take a family several nights to read through together. There are instances where they stop the story being told in the book, which would make for a perfect time to stop for the night when reading aloud to children. ARC reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.

9781416909866,"Andrew Clements has added another great middle grade novel to his list of successful titles. LOST AND FOUND is a sure winner. Identical twins fascinate us. It seems amazing to look so much like someone else that people can't tell the difference. There are fantastic tales of switching places, having their own special form of communication, feeling one another's pain, and reading each other's mind. All that is intriguing to those who are not twins, but when you are an identical twin, there are many times when you wish you were one of a kind. Jay and Ray are entering the sixth grade at a new school, and each is feeling the frustration that their new classmates will not be able to tell them apart. Jay will be Ray, and Ray will be Jay more than they care to think about. However, things don't go as expected when Ray comes down with a cough and a fever that keep him at home on the first day of school. In their homeroom class, Jay is surprised when only his name is called off by the teacher. Shouldn't Ray be called right after him? As the day continues, all the teachers do the same. No one mentions Ray at all. It is not until Jay accidentally notices a blue file with his name on it that looks twice as thick as everyone else's that he realizes the two files have been combined. The school seems to have no idea that his twin brother Ray even exists. As soon as Jay gets home after school, he tells Ray about his interesting discovery. By then Jay has enjoyed one entire day not being a twin. He's even worked out a plan that would allow both boys to experience that wonderful feeling of being one of a kind. They can take turns attending school. One can go and one can stay at home. What can go wrong? Knowing that they can't keep up the ruse forever, they agree to try it for as long as possible. There will be consequences when they are caught, but both decide it is worth the risk. Little do they know, by pretending to be one another, they must be more alike than ever before. LOST AND FOUND is an entertaining story guaranteed to hold the interest of the 9-12 age group. Clements has a way of making the story sound like it could be happening right in the reader's own classroom. In addition to humor and suspense, there are opportunities for good classroom discussion including plot predictions, cause and effect relationships, and decision-making consequences. Whether inside or outside the classroom, LOST AND FOUND is a fun read.",TeensReadToo

Lucky's mother met an unfortunate end when she stepped out of their desert trailer home after a storm and touched a downed electrical wire. She was electrocuted and now Lucky lives with her guardian. Brigitte, a friend of her mother and the first wife of Lucky's father, came from France to take care of Lucky. Recent events have Lucky feeling suspicious. She seems to think Brigitte may be getting ready to return to France, leaving her behind in an L.A. orphanage. There is not much to do in the desert town of Hard Pan -- population 43. Lucky spends quite a bit of her time outside the local meeting place for what she calls the ""anonymous"" groups. She hears the down-and-out stories of members of Alcoholics Anonymous, Smokers Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, and more. Lucky hears about how these folks have hit ""rock bottom"" and then gone on to find their ""higher power."" Maybe if Lucky can find this higher power, Brigitte will see that it is necessary for her to stay in Hard Pan and take care of her. Filled with colorful characters, innocent interpretations of the world, and unique surroundings, THE HIGHER POWER OF LUCKY takes the reader into the world of a brave little girl whose life experiences could challenge even a well-adjusted adult. Through Lucky's eyes readers will come to appreciate the wonders of the desert and the fascinating and quirky behavior of the people who touch her life. I was reminded of the previously successful BECAUSE OF WINN DIXIE by Kate DiCamillo when I read this book.

Mr. Morris has taken the story of Lancelot and made it entertaining and fun for readers of all ages. THE ADVENTURES OF SIR LANCELOT THE GREAT is the first book in the new THE KNIGHTS' TALES series. In this retelling of Sir Lancelot, Mr. Morris makes Lancelot humorous and quite the whimsical knight. Lancelot hears that the knights of King Arthur are the best and shiniest in the lands. So he leaves his father and his home country, France, on a quest for the world-famous knights. On his journey, he winds up in a rain storm, making his armor quite muddy. In his attempts to clean his armor to present himself to the Court of King Arthur, he is attacked by sixteen different knights. As his right hand was busy cleaning his armor, he managed to defeat all sixteen by using his left hand. Little did he know, he had stumbled into the midst of a tournament and unknowingly wins. As with all the adventures in this quick read, Mr. Morris makes the story humorous when it is revealed that this very tournament was for King Arthur himself. Readers of all ages will delight in the amusing adventures that Lancelot finds himself faced with. He gets caught in a tree, tied up by four queens, and becomes a reclusive forest man. Aiding the storytelling are the equally entertaining illustrations done by Aaron Renier.

A grandmother tells her granddaughter her story of the holocaust and how she was taken care of by a French family when her parents were carted off to a concentration camp one night. A beautiful, moving story that manages to tell the heartbreak and tragedy from a young child's perspective. The child is not told much of what is really going on, just enough to know the danger and that something very bad is happening. The adults are trying to protect a small part of her childhood innocence in the middle of all this horror. This makes ""Hidden"" a perfect first book on the holocaust for younger children, as the content is kept very age appropriate for about Gr. 2/3 and up. I'm impressed with the quality and reality of the tale while being sensitive to its younger audience. I love the art which is typically French and also uses disproportionate bodies with large heads.

This book takes a small turn from the formula of the first three. First the boxcar is not mentioned at all, not even in reminiscences of the past, and the children do not this time go off on their own and make do in the wilderness. First we see cousin Joe and Alice sent off to Europe for summer vacation on the first page. This allows the introduction of yet another new relative to the picture, this time it is Grandfather's sister, the children's ""Aunt"" Jane. First the girls go to visit this crotchety old lady and win over her heart and then the boys follow suit. Once again the mystery starts off with a mystery person, a stranger in town. Could he possibly be up to no good? Then three men try to buy off Aunt Jane's farm by telling her lies that the farm is worthless. Who are these suspicious men? The children set out to answer this mystery and end up finding another exciting mystery as well. Another fun, entertaining entry in the series. This one does show its age a little though with the discovery of Uranium on the farm. I know little of this mineral and after briefly reading about it find the story is quite naive in its treatment of the mining of such and that the ranch being on a Uranium deposit could possibly have been a health concern as would having a fireplace made out of Uranium. But I imagine in the 50's, Uranium was the ""thing"" what with it being the beging of the nuclear age and all. This is all irrelevant to the enjoyment of the story for children, though.",Nicola Mansfield

This is Jeremy's life, until the day the postman delivers a package addressed to his mother. Unable to check his curiosity and the taunts of his best friend, Lizzy, Jeremy opens the package to find a surprise like no other. Inside the cardboard box is another box, one made of a beautiful wood, sanded to a breathtaking sheen, comprised of four intricate locks, and inscribed with the words ""The Meaning of Life."" Underneath those life-changing words are others, smaller, unmistakably carved by his father: ""For Jeremy Fink To Open On His 13th Birthday."" For many kids, turning thirteen is a big deal. After all, you're about to become a legitimate teenager, a purveyor of mystic knowledge, an ""almost-adult"" in a world ruled by adults. For Jeremy, turning thirteen has always been a goal. Now, though, there's another, much more important goal--finding a way to open this magnificent box without breaking it, since no one seems to know where the four keys are that are needed to open the locks. Even more unimaginable is the fact that his father seems to have sent him his birthday gift from beyond the grave. You see, years ago, when Jeremy was eight, his father had died. Had died, actually, at the age of thirty-eight, two years before the fortune teller had told him on his own thirteenth birthday that he would die at age forty. It's important to Jeremy to open that box. It's imperative. It's a necessity. Somehow, his father knew the true meaning of life, and he's managed to provide Jeremy with that tantalizing secret. But how will he get the box open without breaking it--something he refuses to do? How will he and Lizzy, the risk-taker best friend with the non-stop mouth, figure out where to get the keys that hold the answers to that all-important question? When one of their schemes to get the keys to the box goes awry, both Jeremy and Lizzy are forced into working for a mysterious man who may just end up having the answers they need. JEREMY FINK AND THE MEANING OF LIFE is a wonderful, emotional read. Yes, I cried at the ending, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This is a book that is about so much more than growing up; a book that is about so much more, even, than finding a way to open a birthday present. For Jeremy, those weeks before his thirteenth birthday are about becoming closer to the father he lost too soon, about learning the value of friendship, and about learning that the meaning of life, quite possibly, is something that each and every one of us can find inside ourselves. Thanks to Ms. Mass for such an emotional, heartfelt read.

Her brother had been killed by lightning. Her friends are White Deer and Running Bird, and she is sweet on the young warrior Tall Boy. One spring day, Bright Morning and Running Bird take their sheep to pasture on the mesa. Bright Morning's black dog barks, and that is when she sees the shadows of the two Spanish slavers who kidnap her and Running Bird to be servants in a Mexican town. After a time, with the help of another slave girl named Nahana, they escape and though pursued are rescued by Tall Boy, who is unfortunately shot but survives. However, not long after their return, the Long Knives (U. S. Army soldiers) force all the Navaho on ""The Long Walk"" into exile at Ft. Sumner in New Mexico, after destroying their homes, crops, and livestock. Many of the Navaho die. Bright Morning and Tall Boy, who has lost the use of his right arm due to his injury, get married, but what will happen to them and their new baby? Scott O'Dell was a great author who wrote some wonderful historical fiction such as Island of the Blue Dolphins and The Hawk That Dare Not Hunt by Day. Sing Down the Moon was a Newbery Honor book in 1971. My first reaction to the book is, ""Oh, another story that emphasizes how badly the whites treated the Indians."" Yes, I know that many white people treated many Indian people badly. I also know that many Indians treated white people who simply wanted to live in peace badly too. In fact, O'Dell points out with fairness, ""...Many treaties were made between the Navahos and the United States. Most of them were broken, some by whites, some by the Indians."" Interestingly enough, as I was reading, I was thinking how the Democrats like to portray themselves as being for all oppressed people and Republicans as being oppressors, but they have their Jefferson and Jackson Day dinners to honor one of their heroes, Andrew Jackson, and his was one of the most anti-Indian administrations in our nation's history leading to the Trail of Tears (1831-1838), whereas it was the Republican Ulysses S. Grant who tried to change federal Indian policy and make it more humane, although there is probably enough blame to go around for both parties. Back to the book, it is a well-crafted and exciting story, in which the Navaho also hear about the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado. All this certainly reminds us that there are some tragic incidents in our country's past which, thankfully, all right-thinking people have come to regret, and O'Dell tells about this one nicely in a sympathetic way. Of course, mention is made of ""the gods"" worshipped by the Navaho, and several references to killings and deaths occur. Indeed, there is a pervasive sense of sorrow that permeates the entire plot, but it does end on a somewhat hopeful note. It is especially recommended for those who are interested in Southwestern Native American history.",Wayne S. Walker

9781419703966,"Reason for Reading: I enjoy this type of children's historical graphic novel/biography and have appreciated Hale's artwork in other books. This was so much more than I had expected it to be. It simply was brilliant and an excellent read all round. Nathan Hale (writer) has done for American History what Rick Geary has done for 19th century crime. The two series are admirably similar in their focus and format bringing more information to the table on exciting events from the past through a totally enticing graphical format. Hale sets up his series by telling the story of the historical Nathan Hale as he is about to be hung, the man, his executioner and a British Guard are on the block when something happens which allows Hale to tell the story of his past which includes the story of the American Revolution up to this point. Told with extreme detail, I was quite amazed at how much I was actually interested in (and understood) the military strategy, battle details and reasonings behind various maneuvers. This part of war I'm not usually very interested in but Hale (author) has made it exciting and funny. Along with this detail, there is also the personal stories of the people involved in the war as they related to Hale (the spy). We learn about Henry Knox, George Washington, Thomas Knowlton, Benjamin Tallmadge and many others. I especially appreciated how Hale (the author) brought history alive with his humour; he sometimes goes beyond the scope of the book and makes comments about our world to the reader, he pokes great fun at these historical characters, making fun of strange names and strange circumstances. The executioner is my favourite character as he is the one he is not quite so ""book-smart"" and asks the questions and makes the comments the reader probably would. Following the excellent tale about Nathan Hale (officer & spy) and the American Revolution up until that point is a small epilogue in which Nathan's hanging is delayed so he may tell some more tales of American History, since he now has the power of knowing both the past and the future. Then the book is still not over. Next up comes a quick biographical info on all the major players in the book, leading up to what actually happened to them in the end. Then the author does a funny little segment where he thanks those who helped make the book including the researchers, who just happen to be babies! This is quite hilarious as the babies explain how one researches for such a project as a book like this. Then there is a little Q&A section where it is explained where artistic licence has been taken with actual historical events and where the author has supposed based on less than forthcoming historical data. And if you didn't think that was enough the book finally ends with a mini-comic about Crispus Attucks. It tells of his life through death but concentrates on the Boston Massacre (discussed already in the main story). A veritable goldmine of information. A joy to read, not only because it is exciting but also because it is hilariously funny. Highly recommended and I can't wait to get my hands on the 2nd book, Big Bad Ironclad.",Nicola Mansfield

Another girl in class is Wanda Petronski, who lives in Boggins Heights, the ""bad section"" of town, is very quiet, and seems to have difficulty reading. Wanda wears the same faded blue dress that doesn't hang right to school every day. Once when someone asked her if that was the only dress she had, she replied that she had a hundred dresses hanging in her closet. After that, Peggy began teasing her by asking her every day how many dresses she had, and even Maddie, while she somehow feels uncomfortable about it, joins in the teasing. They're really not intending to be mean or cruel. Then one day Wanda isn't in school. Peggy and Maddie have waited outside to tease her again, and when she doesn't come they are a little late. In fact, Wanda is missing for several days. However, a picture that she has drawn for the school's coloring contest wins a medal. Maddie and Peggy even climb up the hill to the Petronski house in Boggins Heights on a cold, rainy day to see if Wanda is there. Were there really a hundred dresses? How does Maddie feel when the class receives a letter telling them that Wanda, her father, and her brother Jake have moved from their house in Boggins Heights to another city where there will be no more teasing about their funny name. And what can Maddie do to assuage her feelings of guilt? The author's daughter says that during World War I her mother went to elementary school with a poor classmate who was taunted because she wore the same dress to school every day and her Polish name was unusual. The little girl moved away to New York City in the middle of the school year, and Eleanor Estes never had the opportunity to tell her that she was sorry. Helena Estes writes, ""Was the character Maddie based on my mother? Probably."" This tender and touching story, which won a Newbery Honor Award in 1945, teaches children some very important lessons.

This time the 'Carolyn Keene' publishing committee was obvious. A hodgepodge of culprits were added, in an attempt to pack the book with excitement. The result is that Nancy, Helen, and Emily spent 180 pages on disjointed errands. We're weighted down with a shady waitress and gardener, a rude coordinator, Dick's military buddy... Out of nowhere, there are scuba-diving sessions. Additionally, Nancy has an identity thief at home. There's an actress and an ex-waitress to interview out-of-town, a truck makes minor cameos, and diamonds are stolen. The wonderful old inn and legend of lilac trees could weave a dazzling tale. Instead, keeping Mr. Daly on staff, who sold the establishment to Emily & Dick, was superfluous. Thieves discovered hidden doors from the 1700s that he didn't know of. I readily admit I always hope for a genuine ghost story and the cover suggests one but the shimmering lady scarcely appears. No part of the book is sinister. A bomb destroys Nancy & Helen's cabin in a clear murder attempt but Carson Drew merely cautions his daughter! That violence is out of synch with the hodgepodge that comprises the novel. Nancy's impersonator sought to punish someone the reader received no clues about. It was out of left field. Coincidentally, they also had time to mastermind scaring Emily, even though there was never an alternate resort buyer. The excuse for wanting the property is lame, amounting to stolen goods and a handy shed for hiding them. If the owners sold Lilac Inn, the goods would go with them, or run out. Obtaining a brochure-advertised resort to accommodate smuggling, is a poorly-contrived story.",C. Riedel
9781416971702,"Sharon M. Draper is one of my favorite authors. Her books usually focus on high school characters living through high school problems. OUT OF MY MIND heads in a different direction. The main character is faced with the daily struggle of living with severe cerebral palsy. Draper takes readers into a world most can't even come close to imagining. Melody is trapped not only in a wheelchair but also in her own body. She has very little control over her physical functions. She can't walk, can't feed herself, but the worst thing is she can't communicate beyond grunts, squeals, and unreliable facial expressions. People might think her biggest problems are her obvious physical disabilities, but if Melody could speak, she would reveal that she is actually a very smart young girl. She has a photographic memory, and from as early as she can remember, she has been learning words and storing them away. She learned her alphabet, how to count, and gained early reading skills just like every other youngster whose parents sat them in front of the TV to watch Sesame Street. Melody even has a fairly decent command of a second language, Spanish, thanks to the cultural diversity of preschool TV programming. The fact remains, no one knows because Melody can't tell them. Fortunately, Melody's parents sense that their child is intelligent and capable of learning just like every other child, maybe even more so. They speak for Melody and insist she attend public school. It hasn't always been successful, because school officials place Melody in a special education room where the teachers haven't always given her the attention she deserves. With the help of one devoted teacher, a college teacher's aide, and a loving neighbor, Melody is given a chance to learn - and also a chance to speak in her own unique way. Melody's world opens even more when she is mainstreamed into several regular classrooms. She gains confidence and the knowledge that she is as smart as or smarter than many kids her age. With the academic playing field on the level with her peers, she is able to show off her skills and make some friends. However, even though fitting in and being ""normal"" may be her greatest desire, it might prove to be an impossible dream. My heart went out to Melody as she struggled to communicate with those around her. Sharon M. Draper captures the frustration Melody faces every moment of every day. Even though Draper provides a supportive family for Melody, she also shows the frustration of raising a child like Melody. With a direct and frank approach, Draper reveals the ups and downs of dealing with cerebral palsy. Draper covers everything from the physical challenges to the crushing guilt associated with having and raising a child with the condition in her trademark style.",TeensReadToo
9780439613835,"As I would see the title of this book on lists of award winners, I always guessed that it was probably about a little girl named May who went missing. Boy, was I wrong! When twelve-year-old Summer was six, her mother died, and after being passed from house to house by her mother's brothers and sisters in Ohio, she came to live with her Aunt May and Uncle Ob in a rusty old trailer at Deep Water in Fayette County, WV. Now Aunt May has died while out working in her garden, and both Summer and Uncle Ob miss her terribly. Then one day Ob claims that May has sent him a sign from the spirit world, but when he fails to hear any more, he seems to be losing the will to go on living, and Summer just doesn't know what to do about it because she's feeling sad and forlorn herself. However, their neighbor and Summer's odd seventh-grade classmate Cletus Underwood, who has collected a suitcase full of newspaper clippings, has a suggestion on how Uncle Ob, whom he has befriended, can find some comfort. What is it? Will it work? And what will happen to Ob? This book, which won the Newbery Medal in 1993, probably because someone thought that it was a good book to explain death and how kids deal with it, is a strange story. Certainly, mourning over the loss of a loved one is something that we've all felt. Of course, Christians learn to handle such situations by turning to the ""...God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulations..."" (2 Corinthians 1:3-4). While there are a few Biblical references scattered here and there, it is plain that Aunt May and Uncle Ob are not very religious. So where do Cletus, Summer, and Ob turn to find help? They set off in search of the Reverend Miriam B. Young, Small Medium at Large and ""pastor"" of The Spiritualist Church of Glen Meadows, who claims to communicate with the dead. For Bible believers, the theology behind this book is just plain poor. I realize that various people grieve differently and seek comfort in their own way, and in the end things seem to turn out all right in the book, but many parents will likely be concerned about the themes of ""spiritualism,"" seeking answers with mediums, and communicating with the dead. As others have noted, if people do not wish their children to be exposed to these issues in a positive light or would prefer to discuss them with their children in view of their own values, they would not have a clue about the content from the book summary. As to language, in addition to several common euphemisms (blamed, holy crap, heck, bejeezus, and even ""swear to God"" as an interjection), both Ob and Summer use the ""h"" word, Ob uses the ""d"" word, and after using ""a few choice swear words"" he once said that cussing was like taking a strong drink of whiskey because both thawed him out and got his engine running again. In And the Winner Is...A Guide to Newbery Medal Winners from a Christian Perspective, Barb Brandeis and Deb Ekstrand, wrote, ""Uses bad language. If this is the best literature of the year, 1992 was a BAD year."" I don't really recommend Missing May.",Wayne S. Walker
9780316029568,"CONFETTI GIRL should be a big hit with the middle grade market. It takes a Latino backdrop and combines it with likeable characters experiencing the typical ups and downs of middle school life and puts it all in a fun, eye-catching cover. Meet Apolonia (Lina) and her crazy sock collection. She sees herself as overly tall and gawky with skinny legs, an interest in science, and a sometimes annoying directness. Lina lives with her father, a high school English teacher. Several years earlier her mother died after she fell and cut her leg. The cut was not really serious, but the blood infection that followed was. Life has been difficult, but Lina has her best friend, Vanessa, as support. In fact, they have supported each other since Lina's mother died and Vanessa's mother went through a nasty divorce. They have weathered the events fairly well, and now are hoping that their parents can begin to adjust and live more normal lives. Mixed in with these personal tragedies are several other plot twists. Lina's grade in English is plummeting so she finds herself ineligible for sports, the one area where she shines. Vanessa has been acting strange anytime she is around Carlos. Lina has even caught them kissing. She knows part of her anger about this is due to jealousy, since she has liked a boy named Luis for quite some time, but their relationship doesn't seem to be progressing to the same level. Author Diana Lopez is spot-on with her descriptions of budding middle school romance, merciless teasing, and parent/child misunderstandings.

Rose really wants to magic-bake, but her parents only let her run errands for the bakery. That is, until her parents leave her and her brothers for a few days, and her beautiful and mysterious Aunt Lily arrives to help them. Rose has some doubts about Aunt Lily but she has never felt so good before. She feels beautiful, her brothers appreciate her, even her crush notices her.

9781862303768,"Reason for Reading: This is another book from the Random Bookshelf that I am reading from this year. This book interested me because of its similarity to the Dear Canada/Royal Diaries books with the added bonus of being a mystery. Lady Grace Cavendish is 13 years old and one of Queen Elizabeth I's Maids of Honour (a step below a Lady-in-Waiting). She writes in her daybooke as if it were a diary about her day to day adventures which become quite exciting. Since the Queen is her godmother and promised her dead mother that she would acquire a suitable husband for Grace a party is to be celebrated this Valentine's. Here Grace will pick one of her three suitors to be handfasted to until she is sixteen and ready for betrothal. By the end of that night Grace has picked her future husband, a murder has been committed and her betrothed is locked up as the killer with evidence plainly in sight against him. Grace, with the Queen's approval, sets out to prove his innocence along with the help of her friends, a laundry girl, and a boy from the acrobatic troupe. The mystery is fun, Grace is spunky, and the historical setting is quite realistic. All the characters, except Grace, behave and speak according to the period. Grace herself is a fictional character, but real life historical figures do take a part in the story. The atmosphere is very anti-Catholic, with quite a lot of rude prejudiced statements uttered but this is true to history as the time period *was* entirely anti-Catholic to the point of death and religious wars. The author's historical note does nothing to explain this bias, though, which is unfortunate. I didn't take to Grace herself as she acted and spoke as a modern girl would. She barely even cared that she was breaking very strict rules by cavorting around at nighttime on her own, and alas, her punishments were nothing as would have befallen a real girl of the 1500s. Grace's way of speaking is very modern, and the things she wrote in her daybooke would have been blasphemous at the time period, even for the new Church of England faith. As to the mystery, unfortunately, I had it solved before it even occurred! But of course, this is coming from my adult eyes and I do think because the historical setting, with the exception of Grace, is quite accurate that the series could be of some historical benefit and girls will probably enjoy spunky Grace's escapades around court, in hidden corners with the staff and nighttime derring-do.",Nicola Mansfield

H.I.V.E. is a school set on a deserted island where brilliant young adults who have come from criminal families or have taken part in criminal projects are taught to become the worst that they can be. Otto Malpense remembers nothing about how he came to be on the H.I.V.E. island, and neither does him Asian friend, Wing. The H.I.V.E. staff explains to the young criminals that their parents agreed to let them join the school - and that they are under the highest security and scrutiny. Otto, being an extremely smart Alpha, wonders if they were kidnapped and are being held hostage until they graduate. Throughout their time at H.I.V.E., Otto and his friends are enrolled in a number of courses you will not find in your average school. Subjects such as Tactical Education, Stealth and Evasion, Villainy Studies, and many other classes (meant for other students, such as Henchmen).

The basic skeleton of the original story is retained, with the details expanded and tweaked to create a new version that is fun and engaging. Telling the stories of both the Princess and the Prince was a unique way to add dimension, and is done very well. The reader is introduced to the characters not just of the Princess as a beautiful girl waiting and her Prince Charming who dashes in and rescues her gallantly. The characters have depth, and flaws and realism, and I could conjure them in my mind throughout their adventure. There were also moments of humour, and I found it to be an entertaining read.

9780062104892,"In fairytales, Good always defeat Evil but what if the balance was tipped over? What if the Good became Evil and the Evil turns out to be Good? Will Evil finally win or will Good still prevail? The School for Good and Evil is a fairytale you've never read before. It's a story full of witches, princes, princesses, magical creatures, talking animals, magic spells, enchanting places, important lessons, and happy endings. And in this Hogwarts for fairytale characters, not everything you see is what they seem to be. Agatha and Sophie are both imperfectly perfect character which made them realistic and relatable. Sophie was the pretty girl who dreamed of becoming a fairytale princess but was put in the School for Evil to learn the ways of a witch. From the very first time I saw Sophie I knew immediately that she was the Evil one. She's doing good deeds like it was a chore or something. She's not really sincere in helping others. But to be honest, there were a few times where I admired her character. She's has great determination and she's a go-getter. I also love how she's so dedicated in her daily Lunchtime with Sophie. She's trying to make a difference in the school by teaching the other witches on how to be presentable. So as Evil as she may be, she still has some qualities worth admiring. On the other hand, Agatha was the introvert girl who was put in the School for Good to become a fairytale princess and she was my favorite. I can easily relate to her character because we were so much alike. We both like weird stuff, we're not squeamish, love to wear black, hate anything that is pink and girly, and we do anything for our friends. I just don't like whenever she doubts and underestimates herself. She's letting other people dictate her and she believes them more that she believed herself. And it really makes me sad. Good thing, Cinderella's fairy godmother is there to give her some advice and a good, old-fashioned makeover. Soon enough, she realized that she has nothing to be insecure about. Her self-confidence improved and she finally embraced who she really is. I really had fun with this book. I enjoyed their classes like learning how to make potions, casting spells, communicating with animals and surviving fairytales. The Trial by Tale was really awesome. It's like a fairytale version of The Hunger Games with magical creatures and enchanted traps. Overall, this book is AMAZING! The characters where well-developed and jumping right out of the pages, the plot was original, the setting was magical and enthralling, and the ending was unexpected.

9780140367218,"Twenty thousand leagues under the sea is a magnificent novel written by Jules Verne. It is a book of extraordinary creativity and fun that invites you to a world of words that will absorb you to the book forever. It makes a really good literature unit to combine with oceanography, marine biology, seamanship, the science fiction genre, etc. The book starts at the date of 1866, when an inexplicable and mysterious phenomenon creates a major stir for the world. Because of all this tumult, the Abraham Lincoln planned to go off in search of this phenomenon that is causing arguments and harms to voyages of ships that glides along the seas. Professor Pierre Aronnax, quite a noted figure, is invited to go with his faithful assistant Conseil. Also a Canadian master harpoonist Ned Land went on board. Professor Aronnax appears to be a very calm and prudent character. His leadership is shown and his high learning experiences and passion for seas and creatures result as an ardent figure that is fascinated by everything of the Nautilus. He becomes quite satisfied by this unexpected voyage of 10 months and finds every novel feature he comes upon intriguing. On the other hand, Ned Land is an obstinate character, who wishes everyday to fly out of this 'imprisonment,' which he refers the Nautilus as. Ned Land appeared as a character of somewhat staunch in his beliefs and aims. Conseil is faithful as ever to professor Aronnax, following him whenever or whatever. The incredible, extraordinary voyage and life-turning voyage for the three characters mentioned above in hunt for the detrimental phenomenon almost ends with nothing. But, one day the Abraham Lincoln confronts the Nautilus. However, this robust phenomenon turns out to be a submarine owned by Captain Nemo. The situation of turmoil around everyone when the two ships go against each other leads the professor, Conseil and Ned Land to the sea unexpectedly. Whether it is unfortunate or fortunate, they are rescued by mysterious crew men from the phenomenon. They meet Captain Nemo and find that they are literally imprisoned. So they spend their days in the Nautilus which is very interesting in every feature and every capacity it is able to perform. The Professor, in particular, finds the captain and his aims, his experiences and his submarine so intriguing. The professor also discovers that the captain has abandoned his past life of the real world and that he has turned his back towards the world because of some unknown reason. Personal valuable belongings he has collected, famous arts, a library, a saloon, personal rooms for him and his companions and wholesome foods seemed quite satisfactory to him. So days of gratification and days of agreeable new discoveries, time to work on his works, his studies and his notes passed. Submarine hunts, incidents and experiments at the Torres Straits, Papuan savages, the stranding, the coral cemetery, the Suez tunnel, Santorin Island, the Cretan plunger, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the ice-bank, the South pole, the imprisonment in ice, fights with squids, and he also sustains a scene of a ship and a crew sink because of Nautilus and Captain Nemo. My personal choice of the most memorable part of the book was when the Nautilus was trapped in the ice bank. The situation was very dire and it was a situation of imminent danger. Of this particular episode, I was able to feel a sense of warmth between the three characters, Conseil, the professor and Ned Land. Because the submarine was trapped in the bank of ice, the submarine could not be able to get renew of its air. This would have leaded to death of suffocation for all crew members boarded on the Nautilus. The professor was in impending danger of death because of suffocation, however, the two faithful two companions, although in the same difficult and painful situation, was giving all the air they have to the professor. The novel mostly contains of audacious expeditions by captain Nemo but small parts like this gave a feeling of aglow atmospheres and moves of the heart. Twenty thousand leagues under the sea is wizardry of words the humans mind can offer. It is a sea of creativity and imagination. I felt compelled to read on and on. Also it was the first time I wished the book to go incessantly on. I personally thought it brings a charm to me of the seas and ocean expeditions.

9780781403825,"With book four comes a change in format. The book no longer has Arleta listening to stories from Grandma but rather is a story told in the voice of Grandma (Mabel) herself. Each chapter is still an individual vignette unrelated to the others, though mention is occasionally made of past events not only from previous chapters but from previous books. In this book, Mabel talks about the year she and Sarah Jane were in Grade 8 and now that they are growing up, they still manage to get themselves into scrapes from mischievousness but they are more apt to have done something wrong that sits badly on their conscience and their Christian values. This book is a little deeper in the Christian aspect as many of the stories (though certainly not all) the girls are learning where the Gospel and scripture fit into their own lives. I still think these books are laid back enough that non-Christians will accept the characters' religion as part of the story rather than feel as if it is being preached to the reader, as they are not preachy at all, simply wholesome.

9781596434349,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. What a long wait it has been for the fourth volume in this series! Another great entry in the series with fabulous artwork. O'Connor's depictions of Persephone are fantastic, picturing her in a unique Goth style which seems quite appropriate for the Queen of the Dead. While the book is titled Hades, it really tells the story of Persephone and to a lesser degree Demeter which is a twist on the usual telling of this tale which focuses on Demeter and how the seasons came to be in most retellings. O'Connor has taken licence and retold the story addressing Persephone's feelings, attitude and actions which are usually not referred to. This makes for a refreshing story for someone familiar with the tale and adds a fun twist to the myth. I'm not sure I totally agree with this take on the tale, as I've always related to Demeter in this myth (must be my maternal instincts) but since the intended audience is children I think it is a great new view to an old tale that kids will relate to. Some of my favourite things about this series is the author's note, the portrait pages and the detailed ""Notes"" at the back. This is full of quite scholarly information about not just the particular myth but many aspects of Greek mythology and a treasure trove of interesting tidbits and even a veteran reader will learn a new fact or two!

Mabel and Sarah Jane are good girls but they always manage to get themselves into trouble with their fancies and mischief. This time their adventures include a home-made wrinkle cream, trying to get by without wearing their long underwear under their stockings, a week's trip to the city, a surprise birthday party where no one invites the birthday celebrant and eating windfalls (apples) from a neighbours orchard. Wonderful, wholesome stories that will appeal to fans of the Little House or Betsy-Tacy books. These are wonderful examples of Christian fiction, but no religion is no more excessive than that being the way of life for the folks back then. Some stories have no indication they could be classified as Christian while others may have the parents teaching their children a behaviour lesson through scripture. It is all very low key. Think of the Christian element used in the LHOTP TV show.",Nicola Mansfield
9780375836893,"PENNY FROM HEAVEN, a new offering by author Jennifer L. Holm, is an excellent pick for middle grade readers. Set in the early 1950's, it tells a story of everyday life and rich Italian heritage. Penny lives with her mother and her grandparents. At the start of the novel, she's almost twelve. Most of her time is spent hanging out in the neighborhood with her cousin and best friend, Frankie. Bike riding would be fun, but Penny's bike was unfortunately backed over in the driveway. Going swimming in the city pool or taking in an afternoon matinee sounds like quality entertainment, but Penny's mom believes those places are breeding grounds for the dreaded polio everyone seems to be contracting. That doesn't leave much to do, but Penny and Frankie always seem to find something to get into. It might be an attempt to fix the leaky toilet that turns into a major repair job, or the secret mission to discover if great-grandma Nonny wears black underwear to match her old-fashioned black dresses. Penny is surrounded by tons of Italian aunts and uncles, but she misses her father. His death years ago is still shrouded in mystery, one that Penny seems unable to uncover. Her mother is becoming interested in Mr. Mulligan, the milkman. Penny's attempts to pair her mother up with favorite Uncle Dominic fail miserably. Day-to-day life is pretty predictable for Penny and her family until the unthinkable happens. After a tragic accident, Penny finds herself making plans for a very different life. Readers' emotions will be tested as Penny's story unfolds. Jennifer L. Holm is also known for Newbery Honor book OUR ONLY MAY AMELIA and her BOSTON JANE series, which is my personal favorite.",TeensReadToo
9780745962764,"Most children have a bit of a detective in them. Always searching out tidbits of the unknown and ferreting out information in the smallest form. Well, if you happen to know one of these child-detectives, Bible Detective by Peter Martin is just the book for them. It is actually a learning tool, a story book, a Bible study book, and a ""game"" all rolled into one. The illustrations by Peter Kent are tiny, detailed, and packed full of trivia and major points of interest. It is the goal of the reader to find specific hidden items in each illustrated story. And then there is, of course, the hidden ""fox"" that is tucked away in each scene. But the larger picture of this book (or should I say ""gem"") is the fact that the reader is taken on a timeline Bible study learning facts from the Old and New Testaments. The gleaned information is further implanted on the reader's mind because of his/her involvement in searching out minute details within the illustrations. The ""game"" per-say. Exercising one's brain in the solving of puzzles is a stimulus that cements the learning. Bible Detective opens with the story of Noah and completes with the New Testament voyage to the port of Caesarea. Each story gives the Biblical reference as well as the time in which it occurred. I foresee children from the age of 5 and up and the adults that read with them thoroughly enjoying their romp through the pages of Bible Detective as they learn the small details, the main points, and see the bigger picture of these Bible stories.

James Dashner's first story in his new THE 13TH REALITY series, THE JOURNAL OF CURIOUS LETTERS, revolves mainly around a young boy named Atticus (or ""Tick"" as he likes to be called). Tick's adventure begins when he arrives home to find a cryptic letter giving him riddles on something that is supposedly going to save the lives of people around him. Intrigued, he begins his investigation, and, gaining a few friends along the way, tries to dismantle the riddles given to him in a series of thirteen letters.

For the first time, this year I only have the X's left and I will have completed it so I decided to actively search out books. My niece did a little research and came up with this title for me. I had heard of the series before. The kids, age unspecified, have tickets to go see a famous singer who is coming to town with the nickname ""Penguin"". One of their Dad's takes them to the outdoor concert but while there during intermission Dink injures his arm. While this is going on the singer's special diamond penguin necklace is stolen. The kids get involved in the mystery and think they know who may be behind the robbery. Going into this book blind, not knowing whether the series has positive reviews or not I didn't know what to suspect. So I was pleasantly surprised to find myself with a fun little mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed for this early reading level. Well told, interesting, with several possible suspects it should keep young mystery fans entertained. I found myself quickly reading the book in one sitting and deciding to get the first book in the series for my son since it is on target for reading level for him. He is a reluctant reader and this series may just catch his fancy.",Nicola Mansfield
9780061240355,"In this condensed version of John Grogan's best-selling MARLEY & ME, the author has written an adapted version of his life and times with his Labrador Retriever, Marley, that's perfect for younger readers. Having read and fully enjoyed MARLEY & ME when it was first released, I was a little anxious to see how Mr. Grogan would handle a shorter, easier-to-read version for the middle-grade set. Fortunately, MARLEY: A DOG LIKE NO OTHER is a fun, vibrant, and compelling read that even older elementary school students will enjoy. When John and his wife, Jenny, first pick Marley out from a litter of pure-blood Labradors, they have no idea that their small bundle of fur with the big paws and blocky head will eventually turn into a 97-pound drool-machine full of nerves, excitement, and limitless energy. This short story (196 pages) is a testament to the trials, tribulations, and ultimate loyalty of a dog who ended up starring in a feature film. Marley is the type of dog that you love, despite his flaws (and there are many!), and even the youngest of readers will be overjoyed to read about the trouble that he finds himself in on a daily basis. And, I admit, I shed a few tears towards the end of this book, but they were well worth it, because Marley was worth it. One great benefit of this version of Marley's story are the numerous full-color photographs that the author has included.

9780007331994,"This book is published under the Essential Modern Classics list. This is a list of books chosen by the publisher's UK house and is a collection of outstanding books for children. From looking at the titles I'd say the age range varies anywhere from 8 to 15. Four new titles are to be published in 2010 under the Essential Modern Classics list and I think the authors chosen present a unique collection for North American readers to discover. I intend to be keeping up-to-date with ESM as well as digging into their backlist. A wonderful fantasy written in the classic style comparable to ancient British folklore, though the author has created her own world from scratch. As part of the Essential Modern Classics series the book starts with an informative paragraph bio. of the author followed by a short essay entitled ""Why You'll Love This Book"" written by a famous author, in this case Helen Dunmore. Then a quick blurb on just who is Helen Dunmore. This publisher's series also sometimes ends with extra material at the back of the book called ""More Than A Story"". This book contains that section and is extremely interesting, relevant and a bonus to the book. First there is a long ""Author's Note"" in which the author describes how she wrote this book with the input of 4 blind children. Then there is a section on the history of the myths of unicorns around the world and finally a Q & A section with Doherty about the book including the question to why she chose the ending she did. Laura is a blind girl who smells and feels a presence under her bedroom window. She sneaks out at night and finds a unicorn. She climbs upon him and the Wild Ones appear and carry her off into the night. She is told a tale as she is taken to their magical land that Spellhorn has chosen her to be their new Mighty High and only she can truly be their new leader, if she refuses to come Spellhorn will stay with her and the Wild Ones will not be able to return to their home world called the Wilderness. Laura is torn between leaving her family between and the plight of these peoples but when her sight comes back to her, the choice becomes easier. A beautiful little book! For me the mundane beginning, while well written, lasted a little too long making me wonder why this book was so ""essential"" but once the Wild Ones enter the scene it reaches a different level. Laura is a girl with many hurdles and decisions to make starting with her own blindness which gradually grew upon her in her toddlerhood. The journey to the Wilderness is full of decisions for her as the path is not easy and she must put her trust in Spellhorn while struggling with her feelings of turning around and going back home. As the new Mighty High she is faced with tough decisions at every turn. Laura is constantly torn between a ""heart gladness"" and a ""heart sadness"" which she can't even figure out as the longer she is a Wild One the more she forgets who she used to be. The ending is bittersweet and many may wish it had turned out differently. I was hoping for a different turn of events at the end. This is one of those books that will leave you with a sad feeling that you have finished it, so I suggest you read it slowly and enjoy the Wilderness and the Wild Ones as long as you can. Of course, this book would make a perfect gift for any girl who is into unicorns but I think you can be pretty confident any girl who likes fantasy will love this book.

His best friend, Calder, seems to have a new best friend, and it's a girl! And, the city wants to tear down Robie House, the historic Frank Lloyd Wright home that has always been a fixture in their neighborhood. Calder Pillay is torn between his two close friends. He and Tommy have been best friends forever, but he and Petra solved a major mystery and crime together (Chasing Vermeer). They both have great and different talents, and Calder knows that if they could just all work together they could make an amazing team. Maybe even good enough to save Robie House. But it looks like he's going to be stuck in the middle for awhile. If only people could be more like his pentominoes. (Pentominoes are a mathematical tool, a set of twelve shapes of five connected squares. Calder keeps a set in his pocket; they help him think.) Petra Andalee is a quiet girl who likes her books and writing, and she can't figure out why Tommy dislikes her so much. She and Calder make a good team, and Tommy and Calder make a good team, so where's the problem? She's torn between wanting to prove herself and feeling like she shouldn't have to. Either way, she intends to find a way to save one of Frank Lloyd Wright's masterpieces. Between Tommy's finding skills, Calder's logic, and Petra's unique analysis, they aren't about to let the house go quietly. Provided they trust each other enough. And the house might have a few things to say about it, too. There is A LOT going on in this stand alone sequel to Chasing Vermeer. Obviously there is the relationship between the three main characters, and the attempt to save Robie House. There is some Frank Lloyd Wright history, as well as Robie House-specific history. There is also mathematical figuring, and architectural oddities. There are even hidden pictures inside the illustrations. It also brings up some interesting ideas about the science of art and the art of science. There's so much happening that I almost feel like I need to go through the book a few separate times, looking at it from different angles.

9780375851230,"Julia Alvarez's new book, RETURN TO SENDER, explores the issue of illegal immigration. Two twelve-year-olds share their connected stories involving this politically sensitive subject. Tyler's family runs a dairy farm. Up until the sudden death of his grandfather and then his father's farming accident, things had been going well. Now that his older brother is leaving for college, there isn't enough help around to do all that needs doing on the farm. Tyler returns from a visit to his aunt and uncle's to learn that some new folks have moved into the trailer next door. The new people include a Mexican man, his two brothers, and his three daughters. There seems to be some secret about their presence on the farm that Tyler doesn't understand. They have started helping with the milking and other chores and seem to be a big help for his father; however, his mother seems hesitant to reveal too much information about the family. From comments around town and the little bit Tyler overhears from his parents' discussions, he finally realizes that they might actually be breaking the law. The new workers are in the U.S. illegally. According to the information Tyler has gathered, not only could these new workers be arrested, but his parents could also be found guilty because they've hired the undocumented workers. Even though they seem to be saving the farm, they could bring more trouble than they are worth. When school begins in September, Tyler learns that Mari, the oldest daughter, will be in his class. They begin talking and Tyler discovers that Mari is shy but friendly. As their friendship grows, he finds himself not thinking about her questionable status in his country; that is, until she becomes the victim of several cruel bullies in his class. In his attempt to defend Mari, he and his family also become a target. Tyler experiences some difficult times as he struggles to understand loyalty to friends, family, and country. Mari's voice is heard through letters and diary entries as she recounts her view of living in the United States. Love for her own country and her appreciation for what the U.S. has to offer are both clear as she reacts to the situations around her. RETURN TO SENDER presents a sympathetic view of the plight of illegal immigrants. It portrays their desire for a better life as well as the help they provide for struggling small farm owners. Though the issue is much more complicated, perhaps this book's message could give today's politicians something to think about.",TeensReadToo

9780545117159,"Reason for Reading: This is a Cybils '10 nominee and required reading for me as a graphic novels panelist. Missile Mouse grabbed me from the beginning and I can't wait until the next book comes out this January! There are not too many graphic novels that stand out in the pure science fiction genre for children and this was a real delight to read. Missile Mouse is an agent for the Galactic Security Agency, a bit of a rogue who does things his own way and irritates his superiors because of it. He's given a partner for this next mission, hoping to keep him in line this time. MM and Agent Hyde are to infiltrate RIP (the bad guys) and rescue a scientist they kidnapped, then using his info. locate a secret stash of dangerous weapons from the old days. Along the way MM has to fight killer bugs, beefed up RIP shark agents and giant space slug to name a few. This book is really suitable for all ages. While it certainly is intended for the 8 and up crowd it is not childish at all. We're given a healthy dose of pure sci-fi. The story is fun but not silly, Missile Mouse has some good one liners but this is a drama that takes itself seriously along with the usual scientific explanations and jargon. There are a few animal characters but the rest are alien looking creatures. The story is fast-paced, high-action, good guys versus the bad guys and I can see this series developing a devoted fan base very quickly. The artwork is bright and bold and always enhances its science fiction atmosphere. My only quibble is that one year between books is too long to wait!

He really has no favourite character as he enjoys them all, even the evil Pitch. Quite a few new characters are introduced in this volume, leaving some of the smaller regular characters without much page time, though I do seem to think everyone at least does get mention. New to the series are the villain ""The Monkey King"", in league with Pitch of course, and his ""Monkey Army, the titular character, and a surprise new character appears in the final chapters. I just love Toothiana, a re-imagining of the tooth fairy. She is a tall warrior, who has the ability to multiply into miniature versions of herself, and her appearance and mannerisms are birdlike. An appealing, attractive character. The plot marches forward with the overall arching theme of the series and yet this volume does have a somewhat separate plot of it's own, though rather esoterical, one of feeling a false relief and safety. Finding Joyce's art stunning as ever and delighting in this series, which I am fond of comparing ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" not in content but in target audience and quality fantasy plot and writing. We are ready to see the movie now as we've read all the books ""The Sandman"" picture book review coming soon.

9781444003215,"I liked the premise of this book, but I was also quite weary about it when I first heard about it. I thought the idea behind it was interesting, but I'm always a little apprehensive of time-travel novels (I can find them very confusing) and I think that this book is aimed more towards middle grade children rather than young adults. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable! I admit that, at the start, I didn't think that I was going to enjoy this book as much as I did. Our protagonist, Jenni, is 12 years old and so talks quite immaturely, but this should be expected. She is quite excitable and the overuse of exclamation marks did start to bug me a little. However, as things start to change in Jenni's life, when she finds a lift which can transport her through time, her attitude, outlook and emotions quickly begin to mature, which I was thankful for. I'm glad that she didn't completely mature though - it was definitely as though it was a young teenager communicating with us. I'd say that this is probably aimed more towards 9-12 year olds, but as the book progressed, I think some of the issues discussed and the story in general could appeal to young adults. I actually liked the simple style that it was written in. The time travel idea wasn't made to be complex, and as it was straight forward, it was really easy to follow. It is, despite some serious subjects, a light and easy read that a lot of people may enjoy. Jenni tries to visit her friend Autumn one day, and finds that she has travelled a year into the future, where we learn that something disastrous has happened which has destroyed Autumn's life and that also threatens their friendship. I found the way that Jenni handled herself and the situation to be both believable and interesting. I didn't really find the sub plot, where Jenni meets a woman who has also travelled into the future, to be particularly interesting but it was a good attempt of adding something extra to the story and I can see why people would enjoy it. The story flowed well and it was certainly a page turner at points. I found myself to get quite absorbed into Jenni and Autumn's story, wishing I could help. As I was so enthralled, it didn't take me very long at all to finish this one. The story unravelled at a good pace and it wasn't very predictable, especially towards the end, which I really enjoyed. Everything was summed up by the end, and so there was a satisfying ending. If you find reading about changing and developing friendships, you'd probably enjoy this. Don't be put off by the sci-fi idea, even if you're not usually a fan - this is a simple, quick and enjoyable read.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

Publisher's Summary: ""My Path to Heaven is an old-fashioned ""retreat-in-a-book"" that helps Catholic children, ages 9-12, ponder the truths of the Faith and calls them to live lives of holiness in accordance with those truths."" Acquired: Purchased a new copy from an online retailer. Reason for Reading: We always start our homeschool time together with God. First using something for study, then reading a story or passage from the Bible. I just happened to stumble upon this book online and after looking at the sample pages was extremely excited about using it with my son as a catechises/devotional. This book is utterly amazing and I highly recommend it. I do not have the theological background to do justice to it by trying to explain it to you and anything I do say about it will only be a small portion of just how beautiful and spiritually captivating and instructional it really is. This is a twelve lesson course and we did one lesson a school week, thus with the occasional week off it took us just over 3 months to complete. During that period of time, my son's knowledge of God & Jesus has blossomed and intensified. He has formed from a childish knowledge of his faith to a more mature and personal devotion to the Lord which gradually became evident throughout the study of these lessons. He understands concepts he never quite got before. He knows what Love and Hope are, he knows who to pray for, he appreciates the glory of the sacraments and the importance of the Holy Eucharist with a true heart of someone who cannot live without the food the Lord provides for our souls. He speaks of the Lord with knowledge and truth. He has reached a new stage in his religious life and I am so thankful to this book which engaged him on all levels. Briefly how the book works. Each lesson is the same. We start off with an illustrated picture and these are incredibly intricate and detailed pictures which one is asked to study the first day. The picture also has a caption to go along with it to help your thought process. The second day one is to read the accompanying text for the lesson which run two to three pages, usually three. These lessons are written to the children, in an old-fashioned voice, remember the book was originally written in the 1930s, but it is never condescending or babyish (the modern editing may have had a bit to do with this perhaps). It explains theological concepts and Church dogmas so simply, even a youngster listening in could comprehend. The theology is not watered down though in anyway. The Truth is told here. There is a Heaven and a Hell and it is up to you where you will go. God sends no one to Hell. He gave us free will and we make the choice to go there on our own by the way we choose to live our lives and the lessons in this book each touch on a subject and show one how to strive for holiness, remembering that we have a forgiving God. That while the Devil will tempt us with snares, God will show mercy and patience as long as we return to him and keep striving for that holiness through which this book shows children how to pick up their cross and follow Jesus. The lessons suggests spending more than one day reading the lesson. Then finally there is a list of anywhere from 10 to 20 ""yes"" or ""no"" questions at the end of each lesson to catechize the student/reader to obtain there understanding of the material covered. Interestingly, there are no answers. Just an accumulation of the yeses and noes such as Answer: 14: Yes, 6: No. This makes the Instructor/leader have to pay attention as well. I will say these lessons brought about some amazing discussions between ds and I. He is 11 and autistic, he discussed throughout the lessons about the topics and we even got way off topic and he had me answering questions about morality, ethics, what about the people who don't believe, abortion, what do we do with bad guy killers and a whole bunch of other stuff. He's a very intelligent kid when it comes to this stuff and his lack of verbalizing in the usual way most of the time, makes it very thrilling to have these conversations with him when he takes the lead. I highly recommend this book for individual or small group settings such as homeschool Sunday School.",Nicola Mansfield

9780060882105,"In the fifth installment of the SEPTIMUS HEAP saga, Septimus has been made senior apprentice after having returned alive (the only apprentice to do so) from his Queste. Septimus and his dragon, Spit Fyre, set off on what is supposed to be a simple mission to retrieve his friends Princess Jenna, Nicko, Beetle, Snorri, Ullr, and Milo from the Trading Post, where he had left them at the end of the last mission. The retrieval quickly becomes complicated when Septimus mistakenly refuses the live SafeCharm sent to him by Aunt Zelda. The SafeCharm, which holds a jinnee, is stolen from the delivery boy to whom Zelda had entrusted it and opened by a boy named Merrin. Since Merrin is not particularly bright, he has no idea of what a jinnee is, let alone what to do with one. As a result, the jinnee is set free to wreak havoc. Meanwhile, Wolf Boy, one of Septimus' best friends, sets off on his own Task, which will lead him to fulfill the role of Zelda's apprentice, or Intended Keeper. When Septimus meets up with his friends, they are on a ship owned by Milo Banda, Jenna's father, and only Jenna and Beetle decide to return with Septimus and Spit Fyre. The separation of the friends causes problems for both groups, as Septimus' group runs into a dangerous storm during which Spit Fyre is injured and crash lands on a small island, and Nicko's group must deal with a mysterious chest that Milo has brought onto his ship. As usual, Sage captures attention from the first page and holds readers enthralled until the last. Fans of Septimus Heap will find this new journey as enjoyable as his previous ones - and will wait impatiently for the next adventure of this likeable young hero. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780763651114,"Reason for Reading: I love mythology and I couldn't pass up a handsome volume like this. Ann Turnbull starts with a brief Introduction to her collection of Greek myths and one thing she mentions is that she has gone back to the ancient Greek versions of the myths for her adaptations thus bringing the reader as close as possible to the tales as the Greeks themselves told. This means some of the stories are a little different than the ""usual"" versions we read. I didn't notice much myself that was entirely out of place, but then I read a lot of Greek mythology. Most of the stories included were ones I had heard before with few exceptions, but these are not all just the most popular stories found in most children's collections. Yes we have the Minotaur, Medusa and King Midas. But there is also Orpheus and Eurydice, Phaethon, Bellerophon, Pan, Echo and Narcissus to name several. The tales are in-depth, without leaving out parts which again children's version's often do. For example Perseus's mission to collect Medusa's head includes the Graeae (Grey Sisters) having not just one eye but one tooth among them (why is the tooth left out of so many children's adaptations?) and on his return home it includes *both* his visit to Atlas holding up the world and his saving of Andromeda. The one story that was entirely new for me was King Midas. In this ancient version, there is no daughter and Midas simply changes his mind when he realizes he will starve to death and the god gives him a method to cure himself as he did intend to reward him not punish him. Then follows another story in which King Midas gives up his wealthy way of life and becomes a forest wandering follower of Pan (sort of a beatnik Midas) where he ends up being punished for offending a different god. This second story was entirely new to me! The artwork is absolutely stunning. This is a large ""coffee table"" size book and Sarah Young has done her multimedia paintings taking from the style of the ancient Greeks found on their pottery. I thought her figures were very similar to that style but in a full colour scheme, the bodies are flowing and lythe and yet sometimes she has heads turned front with bodies going forward (Egyptian style) and other somehow impossible body contortions which only slightly suggest some unnaturalness to them. I enjoy this depiction of the human body. Her use of colour is fantastic as well, generally it is very imposing in dark shades of brown, black, grey and musky tones of other colours but then come whimsical scenes that lighten up with purples and there is the sparing use of metallic gold used for the gods. The only problem I had with the book was that I was not completely taken with Ann Turnbull's voice. She does not seem to have a natural storyteller's voice and at times her paragraphs became a litany of names and telling without really engaging the reader's emotion into the story. I've read some better storytellers, Hugh Lupton, William F. Russell, Nathaniel Hawthorn, et.al., but I still otherwise give this volume credit for being a worthy addition to children's mythology collections.",Nicola Mansfield

9780064410441,"Jake Semple is a twelve-or-thirteen-year-old budding juvenile delinquent with all black ""goth"" clothes, a silver ring through one eyebrow, numerous earrings, and scarlet spiked hair; also he smokes cigarettes and swears a lot. He has been kicked out of the public schools in the whole state of Rhode Island and is rumored to have burnt one of them down. His parents are in jail for growing marijuana in their basement, so he has been sent to live with his grandfather Henry Dugan in rural Traybridge, NC. But after a reign of terror at Traybridge Middle School he is expelled and sent to the ""Creative Academy"" which is what the Applewhite family calls their homeschool program at Wit's End, the sixteen-acre farm on which they live. Randolph Applewhite is a temperamental play director and his often oblivious wife Sibyl Jameson is the author of a mystery series about Petunia Grantham but is trying to write the Great American Novel. Their four children are Cordelia who wants to dance, the elusive Hal who doesn't really know what he wants, E. D. who is Jake's age and just wants to be normal, and four-year-old Destiny who talks all the time. Rounding out the clan is Grandpa Zedediah and Uncle Archie who make artistic but useless furniture and Aunt Lucille who is a poet. The children are homeschooled using a radical unschooling method. Randolph is asked to direct The Sound of Music for the Traybridge Little Theater. The whole family joins in to help, and, after hearing Jake sing, Randolph casts him as Rolf, Liesl's boyfriend who joins the S.S.. Finally Jake has something to be proud of and look forward to. However, in a casting dispute, the chairwoman of the Traybridge Little Theater cancels the show. What will happen to the production? Is there some way to save it? And what will happen to Jake? I first heard about this book in 2003 from Ann Lahrson Fisher who was doing ""News and Commentary"" for Home Education Magazine and wrote, ""Have you ever wondered about the dearth of homeschooled kids on the pages of fiction? Where is the giggle-fest of predicaments that star homeschooled kids, stories written to delight homeschooled readers? Wonder no more-the Applewhites are here! Surviving the Applewhites by Stephanie S. Tolan is a Newbery Honor Book."" The Applewhite family, though somewhat eccentric and some might even think dysfunctional, is rather lovable in an oddball sort of way, and Jake does end up learning some important lessons about life and about himself, so there is a happy ending. However, not everyone will appreciate all aspects of the story. Traditional homeschoolers may not think that the picture of the completely unstructured and chaotic way in which the Applewhites run their Creative Academy is a very favorable view of homeschooling in general. I am not an unschooler, nor do I necessarily encourage unschooling. However, I have known several unschoolers, and they have generally done well in achieving the education of their children, so this is not one of the aspects which bothers me. The Applewhites, at least Aunt Lucille, seem steeped in New Age religion with her zen, meditation guru, and talking to nature spirits. Someone else suggested that perhaps most of the adults are too self-absorbed and engrossed in their own lives to have much involvement in the children's. As to language, Jake and others are said to swear and curse several times, though amazingly enough very little bad language is actually used. Jake wonders why E. D. is ""pi**ed off,"" and something is said to come ""like bats out of he**."" However, one's opinion of the entire book may hinge on whether one finds a great deal of humor in teenage Jake's teaching little Destiny all about the meaning and usage of ""the F word."" The actual term is never found in the book, but it is referred to in that way a number of times. The rest of the story is well-written and interesting to read even if it is a bit off-beat, but there are still at least a few of us left who do not find this sort of thing very amusing. The book is certainly not all bad, but as a result of this, I would not really encourage my children to read it. Christian parents would probably feel quite annoyed if their eight-year-old comes up while reading the book and asks, ""Mommy, what is the F word?"" The fact that a story which talks about using ""the F word"" won a Newbery Honor award doesn't really surprise me because that kind of thing seems to be right down the American Library Association's alley.",Wayne S.

For many, this was their first introduction to the musical phenomena from China. At only 26 years of age, Lang Lang has accomplished more than many twice his age. Starting at a young age, when most of us aren't even out of diapers yet, Lang Lang showed an affinity for the piano. Not being able to reach the pedals, and needing pillows under him to reach the keys, Lang Lang was a prodigy. Coming from a humble background from the city of Shenyang, located northeast of Beijing, the only chance of any future in classical piano for Lang Lang would come if he could gain acceptance to the conservatory in Beijing. But he would have to place in the top eight to win one of the precious scholarships. Lang Lang's family could ill afford for him to attend without the scholarship. His family had sacrificed everything for him to get this far. His father left his job in Shenyang to travel to Beijing to be with Lang Lang. Lang Lang's mother remained in Shenyang to be the breadwinner of the family and support both Lang Lang and his father. Spurred by his father's demand to be the best and Number 1, Lang Lang enters piano competitions, aspiring to be the best in China, then Europe, and ultimately the world. After winning the prestigious Tchaikovsky prize in Japan, he is admitted to the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. While there, he continues his training, awaiting his lucky break into the world of classical piano. LANG LANG: PLAYING WITH FLYING KEYS is a truly inspiring story.

Through trials and triumphs, Lang Lang always retains his love for the piano. He shares his love of music with the reader. The writing style flows easily for younger readers to enjoy.

9781599908731,"Princess Academy was always my favorite Shannon Hale novel (The Goose Girl was a close second). So when I discovered that Hale was going to publish a sequel, I. Squealed. PLOT: Now that Miri's friend Britta has become the new princess, she has invited Miri and the other academy girls to the capital of Danland to see her wedding. Miri is not only excited to see the lowlands but also scared to leave behind Mount Eskel for those few months. And when she reaches her destination, she enters the Queen's Castle, a prestigious academy for scholars where she meets another boy (who may become Peder's rival for Miri's heart) and she can learn even more. And learn she does-because she discovers that there is revolution brewing in the streets of Asland. People have been inspired by Miri's own little revolution in Mount Eskel, and they are silently planning to overthrow the king himself. Throughout the novel there is a recurring theme of old vs. new. Miri has the toughest decisions in attempting to decide between Mount Eskel and the capital, between Peder and a new crush, and between her loyalty to Britta and the allure of the revolution. I thought this was ingenious of Shannon Hale, especially since indecision is relevant to all of us. Both sides tug at her heart, and she has no idea what she should choose. I'll admit that I had an idea of what she would choose in the end (I was rooting for that side, after all), but the novel was not predictable. At all. (Well, minus the fact that I figured out who was the ""new crush"" when I first met him.) I'm sad to say that there's less of a focus on linder magic in Palace of Stone, but there is a little magic mystery that would make any fantasy lovers happy. The romance in this novel was TOO adorable. I don't want to give anything away, but I completely kyaaa-ed when [insert name] [insert action] Miri. I'm a long diehard fan of that couple, so I was a bit annoyed when Shannon Hale thrust them apart for a while (bleh, why must they both be too busy for each other at times?) but I was satisfied in the end. (Awwww.) CHARACTER: I love how in Princess Academy, Miri learned to become book-smart, but in this book, Miri learned how to become street-smart. The concept of revolution has really changed her perspective on what she thought was the norm, but her loyalty to Britta keeps her anchored. I've always thought of Miri as a strong girl, and seeing her crumble like this at times made me a little sad-but I was proud of her in the end because she finally figured out her own way to solve her problems. WRITING STYLE: Shannon Hale's writing is exceptional. Though the description and diction isn't particularly incredible, Hale's style of writing seems almost magical. It evokes the idea of a fairytale-which certainly came in handy when she wrote her Books of Bayern series. Her writing is fluid and distinctive, and it wraps the story up in a pretty red bow. Overall, Palace of Stone is one of Shannon Hale's best works. The beautiful writing wraps the intriguing plot and the likable characters into a superb, thought-provoking work of art.

Before long, Calder's dad invites him on a trip to England with him. Calder is super excited about the opportunity and learns that the town they're staying in is home to one of Alexander Calder's sculptures, The Minotaur. When Calder and his dad arrive in the small town, they find that not everyone is as excited about the sculpture as Calder is -- and quite a few people want it gone. While Calder's dad is off at his seminars all day, Calder starts exploring the town and even goes to the famous Blenheim Palace gardens and maze. This is the ultimate place for Calder as he loves puzzles and mazes. One night, though, both Calder and the sculpture go missing.....a coincidence... maybe? When Calder doesn't show up after a couple of nights, his worry-stricken father brings in some back-up, Petra and Tommy. Together they will try and solve the mystery of where Calder is and what happened to the sculpture. As always, Blue Balliett has created an intricately woven story which takes art, mystery, and friendship and turns it into one heck of a book. What's especially nice about THE CALDER GAME is that you don't necessarily have to have read the other books in the series (CHASING VERMEER and THE WRIGHT 3) to understand what's going on; while it would be nice, this story is complete on its own. While I really liked this book, I'm not sure it was quite as good as the first, which often happens, but it was still really good. I liked all of the twists and turns in the mystery and it was fun trying to figure out what happened. I loved the underlying art theme, which made the book very interesting. I definitely think that it takes a certain type of person to want to read this book, as there is a lot of art talk, which I love, but others may not. All in all, I really enjoyed THE CALDER GAME and look forward to more in the series. One last note! The illustrations in this book, while sparse, were incredible. I thought they really added to the story and I loved them.",TeensReadToo
9781780872476,"Jinx was a very interesting read that even people who normally do not venture into middle grade would enjoy (myself included). Jinx is just a curious little boy who has a knack at finding troublesome situations and it almost seems that he is trying to live up to his name. Although he can be curious with different situations and aspects of life, he is very people cautious. This book is very easy to fall into and the world plays out almost like a fantasy video game and that is what I liked the best and the middle grade crowd probably will too. It is not to serious and the idea that a little boy just wants to go out and explore is a notion that a lot people (not just middle graders) can relate too.",Danielle Baldazo
9781780872476,"Jinx is very well-written, Blackwood knows how to engage the reader with the adventures the characters go on and creates distinct characters. I was very surprised by how Jinx managed to have thought-provoking lines which is not rare when I read MG books. Jinx is an adventurous and curious child who wants to see more of the world and learn more too. Enjoyed his relationship with Simon who is very different and more moody and morose but you could see his affection for Simon. The world is written very well and although quite simplistic, what was written out was done well. I also liked the style of writing - it really helped in creating the overall atmosphere for a fantasy book. I highly recommend this to MG readers, especially those who love fantasy or are curious about fantasy.",Charlotte Song
9781780872476,"Jinx lives with his step-parents in a clearing within the Urwald - a vast forest teeming with nasty creatures and nastier wizards and witches. One day, Jinx's stepfather decides he can no longer support the boy and takes him out into the forest to abandon him. Unfortunately for Jinx's stepfather, they cross paths with Simon, an evil wizard. Simon offers to buy the boy instead and takes him home to do chores for him. He doesn't seem that evil to Jinx, but can he really be trusted? At first glance you may think that this book is another Harry Potter-ish clone, but while there are similarities, Jinx is quite a different story altogether. Jinx is a very determined little boy - he wants to get out and see the world, and feels trapped living with Simon. Once he's set on his quest, he begins to question everything and must stick to his beliefs and trust in his own power to get through the coming trials. He's quite a grumpy child at times, but is also quite cheeky and there are some very funny moments as he interacts with the world around him. Jinx is a fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously, and sets a perfect tone for its intended audience. Highly recommended for the middle-grader in your life, or for anyone to enjoy, for that matter!",Anika Claire
9780807551417,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. I am collecting the first original 19 books of this series. Mike's Mystery could probably be said to have the first full blown mystery for the children to solve. All the previous books ""mystery"" was simply finding out the identity of mysterious strangers but this time we have a crime: arson, a witness: Mike's dog, and a couple of clues: a blue hat and a picture in a newspaper. We get a sense of real detecting going on for the children now. Mike's Mystery is also the first time that a book in this series is dependant on another in the series. This one is a direct sequel to book #4, Mystery Ranch, and will be enjoyed much better having read them in order. Also, one of the main characters returns from book #2, Surprise Island, and again this benefits readers who have read the books in order, otherwise many references to previous exploits will by lost upon them. The series is shaping up at this point into an ongoing adhesive collection, rather than just individual stories. This story is typical fare for the series, much better than the last book and fun to see a proper mystery unravelling for the children this time. Exactly one year has passed since the last events happened and the Aldens return to the Mystery Ranch to find many changes have been made over the school year. A large cast of characters this time, though the majority of them have already been met in the past books so nobody new to really get to know. Benny and his friend Mike shine as the major characters in this book, even though everything is still much a group effort for the Alden children, focus is allowed to drift more often towards the littlest brother. A satisfying entry in the series.",Nicola Mansfield
9780064400466,"I don't know about anyone else, but whenever I hear the words Freaky and Friday, I automatically think back to Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis circa 2003. But this is a different FREAKY FRIDAY, the original, the better of the two in my opinion (I know there was another movie version in the 70s, but I've not seen it in years, and don't remember much about it besides Jodie Foster). This is the story of Annabel and Ellen Andrews, and Annabel needing to learn her lesson. I will tell you now, don't expect the same exact story as the movie that you've probably seen at some point in your life; expect the same premise, but a better story. Annabel is the stereotypical 13-year-old girl: she's loud, bossy, and negative, hates her family and teachers, but loves her friends and annoying her brother. Annabel is a highly amusing narrator and she sees things like most kids do, i.e. better than adults give them credit for. Annabel wakes up as her mother, gets dressed, fixes breakfast, sends Ben, aka Ape Face, and Annabel off to school, and then goes through her day in her mother's body. Dealing with all kinds of issues throughout the day, from the neighbor boy saying he loves her, losing both the kids, the police thinking she's crazy, and her husband's unexpected clients as guests, she handles it well...at first. Not only does she have a wild ride, dealing with things her mother normally would have to deal with, she also has a school meeting to attend...about herself. She finds out things that she probably needed to hear, but things that hurt to hear, and that's where the lesson really starts to set in. The majority of the story is told from Annabel's perspective, while she is in her mother's body, and that actually helps the humor even more. Take this little gem for instance: ""Well, in case you're interested, a mouthful of heart is something like a mouthful of captured frog, and a mind in turmoil simply means all the blood in your body rushes around in your head, leaving you icy cold from the neck down. As for 'butterflies in the stomach,' there is no such thing. They are June bugs."" You'll have to read the book to find out the context here, but there are plenty more humorous moments between the 175 pages that make up this book. This is a quick read, but one I definitely recommend. It's funny and somewhat realistic, not in the whole switching bodies with your mother aspect, but in the way this family interacts with one another. I know that despite the length and the material that make up this adorable story, even I learned something about myself and I think everyone could take something away from this book, kids and parents alike. The whole 1972 copyright may throw some people off, but don't let it; it's a story that is still relevant today and probably will continue to be for as long as there are 13-year-old girls with mothers and little brothers especially.",TeensReadToo

The story goes up to about Cece's year in 5th grade, the year she finally has a small group of friends and feels comfortable in herself. An entertaining story but not exactly exciting nor did I find it humorous. The art reminded me much of Marc Brown and I particularly thought Cece looked like Arthur's sister, D.J.

The ring Russell has just purchased is more than a ring -it can transform Russell into a monster. Russell loves monsters, so he enjoys becoming one with the turn of his ring. Plus, Halloween is coming up and transforming himself into a monster would be the best costume ever. But being a monster is dangerous, and when Russell dares to turn the ring and transform into a monster again and again, he gets much more than fur and horns! I have been a big fan of Bruce Coville since I was a child, so I was excited to see this series re-released. This book is the first in the MAGIC SHOP books and is the perfect treat for a funny, spooky read. The story was short, but it had just the right amount of humor and mystery. At the end, the book included a note from the author in which he mentioned he wrote THE MONSTER'S RING so he would have a great Halloween read.

9780142413074,"Rory Hennessy is firmly rooted in reality. In some ways, far too much so for a thirteen-year-old boy, but that's sometimes what happens when it's just a boy, his mom, and his little sister. Regardless, Rory has always been able to see through and explain magic tricks. So in the interest of not spoiling his sister Bridget's ninth birthday party, Rory is avoiding the magician she insisted on having. The magician, however, is intent on Rory's participation. The result is a trick that Rory can't begin to explain or understand, and a cryptic message about Rory being in danger. Suddenly, everything is different. Rory is seeing things that couldn't possibly be real; gargoyles eating pigeons, a cockroach riding a rat like it was a pony, an Indian warrior that Rory's dreamt about... Maybe there's more to that magician than some silly card tricks. Or else Rory's losing his mind. With Bridget in tow, Rory goes to find the magician. According to the magician there is an entire shadow world that coexists with the Manhattan that Rory and Bridget know and love. It's called Mannahatta, and it's populated by Gods of every kind. Like the God of Justice, or the God of Sample Sales, or the God of Jaywalking. To borrow the magicians words: ""When a mortal does something great, he is reborn in Mannahatta as a spirit. If his legend grows enough, he might be fortunate enough to ascend to godhood."" But there is struggle in Mannahatta: the spirits of the Munsee Indians are trapped in Central Park. The Munsees are connected to the land, but since they are trapped in a man-made park they can't actually connect to the land anymore, upsetting the balance between the two worlds. As possibly the only true mortal who can see Mannahatta without assistance (Bridget can only see things after Rory points them out), Rory is the key to setting the Munsees free. Rory isn't sure he trusts or believes the magician, but there does seem to be a few creepy things trying to attack him. Whether or not Rory is ready or even interested in the adventure, Bridget is ready to kick some butt, starting yesterday. Now Rory has to worry about navigating a world no one else can see, saving it and the world he knows, and keeping Bridget safe. He's got his work cut out for him. Rory is a strong and interesting main character, and Bridget is the irritating little sister who makes things worse by trying to help. The author has managed to balance serious ideas (like global warming and the Indian/Colonist conflict) with lighthearted moments (like a rat and squirrel kung fu fighting). The story jumps back and forth between Manhattan and Mannahatta, until they merge with Rory's full understanding. Which is a little bit confusing until you figure out who everyone is. This is a great adventure story that not only keeps you involved, but doubles nicely as a history and geography of Manhattan. I imagine it's particularly poignant if you're a New Yorker, but never having been there I can tell you it didn't lose anything. I think we may not have seen the end of Rory Hennessy, or Bridget, and I'm looking forward to finding out what else Mannahatta has in store for everyone.",TeensReadToo

9780316011709,"For Tom Bender, seventh grade isn't all that different from the grades that came before. He still attends a private Catholic school, St. Catherine's. He's still pretty much best friends with Jeff Hicks. He still loves the Cobra, a sports car that he spends plenty of time dreaming about. The few things that are different this year? He has great teacher, Mrs. Tracy. Jeff's uncle actually owns a Cobra, and Jeff has promised Tom a ride in it. He's in love with Courtney Zisky, a girl he fantasizes about saving from make-believe situations on a daily basis. Oh, and Jessica Feeney shows up in his classroom. The day starts out regular enough. Morning prayers, the announcement of a class election, and the impending arrival of a new girl in their class. And then things change more than anyone could have ever imagined, because Mrs. Tracy informs her students that Jessica, the new girl, is unlike anyone they've ever met before. Jessica was burned in a fire, a terrible, horrible tragedy, and she looks different than anyone these kids have ever seen. Tom has only a short time to think about what this means before she's there, the Firegirl, hideously disfigured yet someone how still wholly alive. What follows in the few short weeks that Jessica Feeney is in his class has a life-changing impact on Tom's life. His friend's jokes and elaborate stories they've made up for how Jessica got burned no longer seem funny. His daydreams keeping slipping Courtney out and Jessica in. And during the class election, where Tom wanted to nominate Courtney so she'd know how he felt about her, he's unable to say anything at all. He takes Jessica her homework during one of her many school absences, and learns the truth behind how she was burned, and he cries because she's just a kid like he himself is. Even a ride in the Cobra, which Tom has been dreaming about for years, is pushed by the wayside. FIREGIRL is the story of being different, of change, and of acceptance. There are no real happily-ever-afters in this book. Jessica isn't miraculously healed, Tom doesn't morph into a superhero or righter of all wrongs, and the students in Mrs. Tracy's class don't all learn that you can accept people who are different. Instead, this is the story of individual strength, of the internal struggle to balance what you know is right with what is wrong. A very inspiring story, indeed.",TeensReadToo
9781596437395,"I love Greek mythology but have to say that when knowing the next book was actually about the Goddess of ""Love"" I wasn't as excited as with the previous books in this series. However, O'Connor went in a great direction with his retelling of Aphrodite's story. He starts back at the beginning with Kaos and Gaea and re-tells the whole story of creation and the Olympians as was done in the first book ""Zeus"", though this time very quickly and from the point of view of Eros from which Athena is formed. After a few tales of Athena's interfering in occasions of love with her always present sidekick, Eros (better known by his Roman name, Cupid), O'Connor chooses to focus on the Judgement of Paris and the Golden Apple. This opens up a whole future of tensions and the set up for the epic War of Troy. O'Connor has added some modern sensibilities to his female characters and modern thoughts on the theme of love which some readers may appreciate, but this reader didn't bringing my rating down to a four.

Call me old fashioned but I like younger kids to receive good role modeling in the books that I buy for them. The heroine rudely dismisses her parents concerns about her devoting so much time to riding, with a 'Whatever, I'm going for a ride.' There are no consequences for that rude behaviour to her parents who are left watching her ride off. Instead she wins the competition and her parents turn up to support her.

9780763645021,"When I was ten, I wanted to be an astronaut. I checked out books from my local library, I worked hard in my science classes, I visited the Kennedy Space Center, and I read a lot of science fiction so that if I ever ran into aliens on my mission to Mars, I'd be prepared. Reading this book made me realize how lucky I was to have grown up in an atmosphere where the abilities of women were respected more or less regardless of their gender. The same year I turned ten, Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. But back in the 1960s, aspiring women had no such role models; if they wanted young girls to understand that it was possible for women to perform just as well as men, they would have to become the models for future generations. In this book, Stone tells the story of the ""Mercury 13,"" a group of thirteen women who fought tooth and nail for entrance into the space program decades before NASA let any women in. The combination of clear prose, firm social and historical grounding, and the detail-oriented nature of this account had me hooked from the beginning, opening a window into the history of women in space. Stone portrays her facts convincingly, utilizing quotes from contemporary media sources like newspapers and magazines along with first-person narratives from the women involved and historical photographs. This combination of sources makes the experience of reading this book visceral, something you feel in your gut. This was particularly evident to me in the chapters where Stone describes in a play-by-play manner the physical and psychological tests that the Mercury 13 underwent in order to prove that they were just as capable as men. For a moment, I felt like I was in that isolation tank, or battling with my first experience of zero-gravity. Throughout my reading, my emotions oscillated between shock at the unbelievable attitudes toward women that prevented the Mercury 13 from ever seeing space and horror at the realization that these events had occurred less than fifty years ago and are still supported to this day by a vocal minority. Although at times it was difficult even to imagine the level of discrimination that these women faced, Stone makes it quite clear that these women had the kind of boldness and courage borne of intelligence and self-respect that allowed them to continue fighting against these obstacles. ALMOST ASTRONAUTS tells a story of courage against the odds, but also of a desire to expand beyond horizons, from the boundary of Earth's atmosphere to the assumed boundaries between genders. It makes a good source for a research report, but the clean and clear writing style makes it much more interesting and easy to follow than the average non-fiction work. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in space and the people allowed to go there.",TeensReadToo
9780440415299,"Reason for Reading: Read aloud to ds as part of our history curriculum. This is a fictional story but the author's note at the end lets us know that it is based on a true story of her grandfather who wrote to First Lady Roosevelt and received help from her. The story takes place in Pennsylvania, 1933, just in the beginning grips of the Depression. Margo's family is feeling the affects of rationing and slower business, but Margo feels secure even though she's seen one family on her street evicted from their house and her best friend, Rosa, across the street has recently had a Sheriff's Notice put on her house. They don't talk about it though. One day at school they are given an assignment to write a letter to someone who is inspiring and Margot hasn't a clue who to write to, while Rosa knows right off that she's writing to Amelia Earhart. That day as they walk home after school, Rosa quickly says goodbye as she was the first to notice that upon Margo's door had been plastered the dreaded Sheriff's Notice. Will they lose their house and everything they own? This is a short little book that packs a big wallop within its pages. The story is told through the eyes of Margo and from her point of view we learn a lot about life during the Great Depression for a regular merchant family. Papa is getting by because he is accepting forms of payment other than money, but the bank doesn't accept this type of business when it comes to house payments and things look bleak. Margo becomes determined to find a way to save the house and her admiration for Eleanor Everywhere, the First Lady, puts an idea into her head. Thus we also learn quite a lot about Eleanor Roosevelt throughout the course of the book as well. The story is emotionally tense at times; it gripped my son too mightily at anxious moments (though he is a sensitive lad). Margo has a little brother who was underdeveloped as a character but otherwise it is a wonderful family story to see the parents confiding in Margo, the mutual respect, and Margo's honour towards her parents.",Nicola Mansfield
9780061768989,"Gail Carson Levine is well-known for taking familiar fairy tales and weaving them with her own magic. THE FAIRY'S REUTRN AND OTHER PRINCESS TALES is no exception. In this collection of the six popular Princess Tales, Levine has rewritten six familiar (and some not-so-familiar) stories until they are virtually unrecognizable. In THE FAIRY'S MISTAKE, which is based on the fairy tale ""Toads and Diamonds,"" two very different sisters are each granted a gift by the fairy Ethelinda. Ethelinda feels that her gifts are both well-deserved, so it comes as a great surprise when she discovers that neither gift brought the results she had planned. THE PRINCESS TEST, which is based on ""The Princess and the Pea,"" tells the story of Lorelei, a blacksmith's daughter, and the prince who falls in love with her. However, the prince's father is determined that his son should marry a princess, so he designs a series of tests to ensure the bride's pedigree. Nicholas still wants to marry Lorelei, but how can she ever pass the tests if she's not a real princess? PRINCESS SONORA AND THE LONG SLEEP is based on ""Sleeping Beauty."" As a baby, Princess Sonora is granted many gifts, each fairy trying to outdo the others and bestow the best gift. As a result, Sonora is a beautiful, precocious young child, and she decides to wait until the opportune moment to prick her finger, which will put the castle to sleep for one-hundred years, as promised by the fairy Belladonna. Her plan, however, doesn't exactly go as planned. In CINDERELLIS AND THE GLASS HILL, which is based on ""The Princess on the Glass Hill,"" Cinderellis is a lonely boy inventor who is ignored and made fun of by his brothers. Princess Marigold is equally lonely, and wishes she had someone to talk to other than her cat. When Marigold's father decides that it's time for her to marry, he puts her on a glass hill that suitors will have to climb, and it will take Cinderellis' best invention yet to win her hand. FOR BIDDLE'S SAKE is based on ""Puddocky,"" and tells the story of Parsley, a young girl who loves eating parsley. Unfortunately, the only place that parsley grows is in the garden of the fairy Bombina, who is in jail for turning too many people into toads. When Bombina is released and Parsley is accidentally turned into a toad, she must find a way to make the most of the situation, and maybe even help someone else along the way. In THE FAIRY'S RETURN, which is based on ""The Golden Goose,"" the fairy Ethelinda is back, and she's nervous about giving any more gifts. But when a baker's son and a princess fall in love and the king forbids their marriage, she just has to do something! So she hopes that everything goes well and gives the baker's son a golden goose.

Nice big words, double spaced, pictures on every two-page spread all to make the book visually appealing to the young/reluctant reader.

There is excitement and silliness and the chapters are just the right length with some variation. Of course George O'Connor's artwork is wonderfully pleasing and adds to the sense of fun these two boys are having. What I especially like is that even though this book is particularly aimed at 5-7 year olds, the book only mentions the children are in Grade Two once. Otherwise, there is no age set upon these characters except that they are kids and my struggling 12yo reader felt the book was appropriate at all times. The story dealt with being annoyed with younger siblings and being quick to blame a friend without any proof. Plus dealing with a neighbour's dog. He enjoys this series and though it is just a tad hard for him, he is doing well with it and we will continue to look forward to Captain Awesome's further adventures.",Nicola Mansfield
9780756691714,"Reason for Reading: I have always been fascinated with the Titanic and am participating in a Titanic Reading Challenge this year. Just mentioning that this book is published by DK will automatically give you an impression as to what to expect. An oversized, hardcover with a plentiful profusion of illustration and upon the survivor's return photographs and contemporary items such as newspaper headlines. The book takes us on a matter of fact chronological course of events that led up to that fateful night, through the sinking and then finally through photographs of the return of the survivors, the news, the inquiries, short blurbs of some survivors and final information on Ballard's finding of the ship 1985. Each topic is a two page spread and drawn in cutaways to show the reader the inside of the boat as she stood. The illustration is labeled all over the place, like one of those old Richard Scary word/picture illustrations. Along the top and the bottom of each page are little vignettes of something happening within the large scene and then the reader is supposed to find that little illustration in the larger picture as in a ""look-and-find"" book. Spending time one will find all sorts of interesting little bits of events going on in the pictures and the occasional humorous one too, like the sailor who happens to be sitting on the toilet in one picture! The pictures are awesome and the cutaways are the perfect way to explore the inside of the ship as we can see where things were situated in comparison to each other. Though no mention of this is made in the book's copyright page this is a reprinting of an earlier title of the same name. The only difference between this book and the earlier ""Story of the Titanic"" illustrated by Steve Noon is that the original is a very large, oversized horizontally wide book, making for an extravagant picture book. This book is oversized but only slightly in the vertical direction and obviously it would loose it's extravagance compared to the original. Having never read, nor seen the original I was non the wiser and enjoyed this book for what I got. Kids will especially like the ""search and find"" interactive component of the book which will have them finding many more hidden treasures in the gorgeous paintings.

Henry and Donn run ahead and meet another climber, Charles Austin, minister with the Church of All Nations in New York City, NY. Donn gets cold and decides to find his own way back to camp rather than wait for the rest. Henry cautions him against doing so and remains with Mr. Austin, but Donn leaves anyway. Unfortunately, a thick, fast-moving fog obscures the path. Donn falls down an embankment that hides him from sight. Then he takes a wrong turn that leaves him alone to wander aimlessly for nine days in the empty mountain wilderness. Will he make it to his camp or be found by the others? This book is Donn's own description of his struggles to survive after being separated from his companions, as told to Joseph B. Egan. For years I saw it advertised in the Christian Book Distributors catalogue and finally decided to purchase it to read as a family read aloud. With no food and no shelter, Donn survives by remembering his Boy Scout skills and by drawing on his faith in himself, his family, and God. His shoes and then his feet were cut to shreds on the rough stone outcroppings. He was tormented by insects, encountered a bear, and tumbled in an icy river. His ""dungarees"" were impossible to walk in, once wet, and he lost them. He suffered from cold, hunger, loneliness, and hallucinations. Toward the end of his ordeal Donn followed telephone wires and a stream, hoping that both would eventually lead him to what civilization there was in the great woods of Maine. Donn's harrowing story, as told to Joseph Burke Egan, who was an author and I think a journalist, apparently was first published later in 1939 and has been a beloved family and school classic in Maine since that time. Through the years, Fendler himself visited schools and libraries to share his experiences, and generations of Maine children have learned lessons about courage, faith, and will from Lost on a Mountain in Maine. I especially like the way in which Donn emphasizes the fact that he put his trust in God and said his prayers daily for God's protection and deliverance. In 2008, Donn's story wes retold for a graphic novel. I guess that this all right for a generation that doesn't want to read words, except for a few in a cartoon bubble every now and then, but prefers just to look at pictures. However, we really enjoyed the original and thought it quite exciting.",Wayne S. Walker

Great Aunt Emilene has been ""delayed,"" which means the girls are stuck with a worse babysitting prospect: Nurse Watkins. Thank goodness Araminta's cooler-than-cool cousin Mathilda shows up and convinces Nurse Watkins that Aunt Tabby wouldn't mind if she looked after the girls alone. But Araminta and Wanda quickly realize there are worse things than having an old fuddy-duddy for a babysitter once they meet Ned and Jed, two young poltergeists Mathilda can't make go away. The mischievous spirits aren't in Spookie Manor more than five minutes before wreaking all sorts of havoc. With resident ghost Sir Horace already on edge over the planned destruction of his old keep, it's not long before he's threatening to vacate the premises permanently. When Ned and Jed's antics lead to the discovery of a tarnished old ring hidden in Sir Horace's armor, the old ghost is beyond despair and out the door with the manor's other two ghosts (his page Edmond and faithful wold Fang) in tow. Together Araminta, Wanda, and Mathilda must find the source of Horace's distress, save his keep, bring their ghosts home, convince their new guests Spookie Manor *isn't* where they want to settle permanently, and set the house back to rights - all before the grown-ups return from their trip. With its light, humorous storytelling and quirky, engaging characters, GHOSTSITTERS gives young readers an entertaining escape into Araminta's world of paranormal excursions and hijinx.",TeensReadToo

We get to know the characters better as we spend more time with them. Princess Rainbow tells her background story which adds a reveal which is most certainly going to be a plot point somewhere down the line. I already have a feeling I know what it means. This time the three friends, along with Rainbow and a guide, journey off to the next village which is inhabited by an elf like race. We are also told what life was like before Uro took over and the important ability of song the inhabitants had of communicating with each other. There are battles against bad guys and the addition of Doug's powers of the Silver Tiger are enormous indeed. This time around Jim must search for his warrior and animal spirit that he will share, the winged panther. I'm loving this story, something totally different for me plotwise, as we move forward with the plot, time is also taken to reveal the background. I haven't picked a favourite character yet, though I have certainly picked the one I don't like, Jim is quite the whiner.

9781576582626,"When we lived in northeast Ohio many years ago, we had several occasions to visit the area around New Philadelphia, Uhrichsville, Dover, Schoenbrunn, Tuscarawas, and Gnadenhutten where there was a lot of Moravian Church history and the Moravian Church is still fairly strong. As a minister, I have always been interested in religious history. Though descended from the followers of early reformer Jan Hus and based upon the principles which he taught, the modern Moravian Church is primarily the result of the work of Count Nicolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf (1700-1760), both of whose parents were from noble German families. His grandfather, Maximillian von Zinzendorf, chose to sell his Austrian possessions and emigrate to Franconia rather than accept forced conversion to Catholicism. Nicolaus's father was in the service of the Saxon Elector at Dresden at the time of his youngest son's birth. He died six weeks later and the child was sent to live with his maternal grandmother and an aunt. His mother married again when he was four years old, and he was educated under the charge of his pietistic Lutheran grandmother, Henriette Catharina von Gersdorff, who did much to shape his character. Educated at the Paedagogium in Halle, where Pietism was strong, and at the University of Wittenberg, the seat of Lutheran traditionalism, Zinzendorf studied law. After graduation, he traveled in the Netherlands, France, and various parts of Germany, then married Erdmuthe Dorothea Reuss, sister of his childhood friend Count Henry Reuss, bought Berthelsdorf from his maternal grandmother, Baroness von Gersdorf, and began his career in the service of the Electors of Saxony at Dresden. In 1722, Zinzendorf offered asylum to a number of persecuted wanderers from Moravia and Bohemia and permitted them to build the village of Herrnhut on a corner of his estate of Berthelsdorf. Many of them were part of the Unitas Fratrum remnant founded by Jan Hus. As Zinzendorf began to study the history of the Moravians, he was astonished to find powerful similarities between the early Unitas Fratrum and the newly established order of Herrnhut. In 1732, the community began sending out missionaries. In 1736, Zinzendorf was exiled from his home in Saxony. He and a number of his followers moved to Ronneburg Castle near Marienborn in Wetteravia, owned by Count Casimir of Budingen, and founded another community known as Herrnhaag. Zinzendorf was consecrated a bishop of the Moravian Church on May 20, 1737. He himself began making missionary trips, in 1739 to St. Thomas in the West Indies, in 1741, to the colony of Pennsylvania, and in 1749 to England, where he lived until 1755. Eventually, Zinzendorf was allowed to return to Saxony, where he died rather suddenly. This is one of the wonderful ""Christian Heroes: Then and Now"" series by Janet and Geoff Benge. There were a number of Zinzendorf's beliefs and practices mentioned in the book with which many would not agree-communion on days other than the first day of the week, some degree of emotionalism, church ""love feasts,"" having women as elders, the belief that God speaks to people directly, and the church's involvement in secular business-but we don't always have to agree with every aspect of a people's theology to accept whatever truth they do teach, to appreciate their courage, and to admire their zeal. Zinzendorf also wrote several hymns, of which the best-known are ""Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness"" and ""Jesus, still lead on."" Unfortunately, very few if any of them have ever appeared in songbooks used by churches of Christ. Other books in the ""Christian Heroes: Then and Now"" series which we have are about Gladys Aylward, Eric Liddell, George Muller, Nate Saint, Rachel Saint, Ida Scudder, Mary Slessor, Corrie ten Boom, and Florence Young. The Benges are also writing another series ""Heroes of History,"" of which we have ones about Thomas Edison, Meriwether Lewis, William Penn, Theodore Roosevelt, Alan Shepard, and Orville Wright. For both series, YWAM publishes study guides which can be used in homeschools or classrooms. They are among the best series of biographies that I have read.",Wayne S. Walker
9780399250330,"THE SIEGE OF MACINDAW, the sixth installment in John Flanagan's best-selling RANGER'S APPRENTICE series, picks up right where THE SORCERER OF THE NORTH left off, with Alyss imprisoned in Macindaw castle at the mercy of Keren the usurper. Will is soon united with enemy-turned-best-friend Horace, deep in Malcolm the Healer's mysterious forest. Much as it pains the two to be so close to Macindaw and yet so helpless, the two know that they do not stand a chance against Keren and his soldiers. Worst of all, Will has no idea what the traitor Keren might be up to. The unexpected arrival of a small Skandian force, led by Gundar Hardstriker, is the ultimate blessing. While the Skandians find themselves stranded in Araluen quite by accident, Will greets them heartily and quickly turns them into his own small army, led by none other than Horace, the Oakleaf Knight. With intelligence covertly provided by Alyss, Will and Horace learn of Keren's plans to turn Macindaw over to the Scotti tribes of Picta. All the odds are against them, but Will and Horace are not about to give up. The ranger and warrior complement each other perfectly, and the two hope that Will's agility and wit paired with Horace's strength and fighting experience will be enough to overcome Keren's forces and the fast-approaching Scotti army. Trying to take Macindaw with only thirty men is a daunting task, a feat never before achieved in Araluen history. In other words, the perfect challenge. It is easy to see why RANGER'S APPRENTICE has such a following with the preteen crowd. THE SIEGE OF MACINDAW is a fantasy adventure with strong characters and a fast-paced plot. Flanagan's characters have heart and his heroes are almost too virtuous to be true. While an adult audience might dismiss Will and Horace as one-dimensional, their shining courage and unwavering sense of morality will appeal to younger readers. Araluen is an epic fantasy world reminiscent of Tamora Pierce's Tortall with a pinch of C. S. Lewis' Narnia thrown in for good measure.",TeensReadToo

No doctors roam the forest and Moon and his Pap had to rely on their knowledge of the forest to survive. When Moon's Pap broke his leg, life in the forest changed for Moon. His Pap's leg got infected and Moon is forced to watch his father die. Alone, Moon is forced to call upon all he knows to survive. But his knowledge of forest lore is not enough to sustain him. He is forced to seek out other humans, which leads to trouble. The law, in the form of Constable Sanders, is relentless in the pursuit of Moon. Moon finds himself placed in Pinson Boys Home in Tuscaloosa. Facing life couped up in an institution is not for Moon. He escapes from Pinson taking all the boys there with him in the home's bus. When the bus goes as far as it can into the forest, two boys, Kit and Hal go with Moon to live off the land. Watt Key is an accomplished writer who knows how to spin a tale well. All those who read Alabama Moon will enjoy following the adventures of Moon Blake. Moon's struggles take the reader back to a time in one's life where all of life was an adventure.

Moon's father is anti-government and they live a reclusive life, surviving on what they can trap and raise with just an occasional trip to the little country general store. When Moon's father suffers a broken leg, and refuses to seek medical help, his subsequent death leaves Moon alone. Moon manages to see to his wilderness burial, but following his father's instructions to go to Alaska and find others that live their way of life is more difficult. While Moon is very resourceful, he doesn't understand the ways of the modern world and has no idea where Alaska is, or how to get there. The attorney that recently purchased the land where Moon and his father lived believes that he is doing the best thing for Moon, and turns him over to a boys home. Moon is determined to escape and so he and two other boys manage steal a bus and run away. Moon's survival skills keep them one step ahead of the abusive and determined constable and out of jail. Moon has a chance to learn firsthand about what friendship means and to be able to interact with boys his own age for the first time. The boys are very sympathetic characters...even the bloodhound sent to track them down decides to join them. Moon begins to question the lessons his father taught him about how bad the government is and to question even his father's lifestyle. Moon is a character that I'll never forget. This action-packed story is filled with chases, captures, and escapes. If you want to encourage reluctant readers, give them this exciting first novel by Watt Key. I'm hoping for another story...Moon is just too good a character to not have a sequel.",TeensReadToo
9780142409329,"It is 1606, and Samuel Collier is an eleven-year-old orphan. His father had drunk himself to death, and his mother died in the poorhouse. Upon his mother's death, her locket was taken to a pawn shop to fetch a little money to cover Samuel's food. However, Sam runs away from the poorhouse, lives on the streets, and then steals the locket but is caught and turned over to a minister named Hunt who runs an orphanage. It just so happens that Mr. Hunt is accompanying a Virginia Company expedition to establish a settlement in the New World, and he offers Samuel the opportunity to become the page for Captain John Smith. This historical fiction book chronicles the first couple of years in the history of Jamestown through the eyes of young Samuel Collier. The question is, will he survive? Author Elisa Carbone, who grew up in Virginia, has written several other books of historical fiction for young people about the region. Her Stealing Freedom (1998), based on a true story of a young Maryland slave girl's harrowing escape to freedom on the Underground Railroad around 1855, was an ALA Best Book for Young Adults, and her Storm Warriors(2001), about racial prejudice against the African American surfmen of the U.S. Lifesaving Service on Pea Island off the North Carolina shore in 1895, won Virginia's 2002 Jefferson Cup Award. When I saw Blood on the River on sale in a discount book store and noticed that it was historical fiction for young people about Jamestown, I immediately picked it up. The author evidently did a lot of detailed research to present a very accurate picture of the Jamestown colony and what happened there. She writes, ""Though in some instances the dialogue is taken from the original records, for the most part I have invented dialogue, thoughts, personalities, and the like. And I have simplified a story that is far too complex to be contained in one book."" Samuel Collier was a real person, though Carbone says that she had to invent his family life and origins. He did accompany Captain Smith on two expeditions, was left to live at a Warraskoyack village for a time, stayed in Virginia when Smith returned to England, and when he grew up was appointed the leader of a Virginia town. There are a few references to drinking ale and wine and a couple of instances where people were said to be completely naked in public. Also, the terms ""by God"" and ""my Lord"" are each used once as an interjection. And Sam does a little bit of lying, especially towards the beginning, although he does learn to accept responsibility as he works with John Smith. Otherwise, this is a very well-written and interesting historical fiction account of the Jamestown story for middle and high school students.",Wayne S. Walker

9780525423348,"I love hearing the original Brothers Grimm stories and how awful and gruesome they were. It just amuses me that they were made to be so squeaky clean after a time. This book takes from some of the original tales and morphs them together in a new take on Hansel and Gretel. The author has a presence in the book as well, giving us reminders that the little kids that scare should be removed from the room at certain points of time. This just adds to the charm since these are the kids that the book is aimed at. While there is more gruesome talk featured in this story than is in most books directed at kids aged 9-12, it isn't over the top or overly detailed. It simply states the facts of what happened and tells you that they were covered in blood, no lingering for effect. It is a great read for reluctant readers, as the chapters are divided up quite well and feel quick to read. It is for both boys and girls, and anyone who has ever questioned how easy those ""once upon a time"" tales really have it. Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.",Jessica

Every day they sit and pass notes back and forth to each other, discussing their fear of being called on. The day after their field trip to the Black Vine Swamp, something mysterious happens. Mrs. Starch doesn't come back, and she is never absent, and people start to wonder. While there might be a scrawled note and a message on her answering machine that states that she has had to deal with a family emergency, people, especially Nick and Marta, aren't buying it. They are all convinced that Smoke, the kid in Mrs. Starch's class that she dislikes the most, has something to do with her disappearance. In a whirlwind adventure filled with arson, endangered animals, the Iraq war, the Florida wet lands, a money hungry wannabe oil rigger, and panther poop, Nick and Marta set out to find their missing biology teacher. Carl Hiaasen definitely has a knack for adventure. Every story he creates always has some crazy plot that makes you think as well as laugh! In this case, Hiaasen poses the problem of destroying the environment for monetary gain and how it affects the ecosystem in a hilarious manner. He also throws in some other great themes to think about: not judging people by their history/the way they look, believing in yourself and never giving up, learning to live with what you've got, and working as a team. These themes are so important for younger readers (and sometimes older!) to learn, and Hiaasen did such a great job of incorporating them into the book without blatantly stating them. While this book has more of a middle-grade audience, it is great for all ages of readers, although there is a tad bit of language. Overall, I think the book was masterfully written and was a worthwhile and entertaining read.",TeensReadToo

9781928832324,"Reason for Reading: Acts is always a little confusing for children to grasp, so I thought a storybook retelling would offer a greater understanding of the book of The Acts of the Apostles before I next begin reading ds the actual New Testament. We begin each homeschool day with time for God, mostly with me reading aloud from books such as this. This book is fantastic! First of all, changes to the original 1939 edition are minimal. Illustrations have been added which match the tone of the text wonderfully. The text itself was only altered with ""minor editorial revisions"". From prior experience with this publisher and having read the text, I'm quite confident that ""revision"" would have consisted of removing colloquialisms, and other such language a 1939 audience would have appreciated but a 21st century one not so much. The book feels as if it was written some time ago and yet doesn't feel outdated or juvenile at all. The book can be read by or to children of all ages but the material can be rather deep and I think 10-13 are probably the most targeted audience. That is not to say teens and adults won't enjoy the book, just remember it is being written to a child. While Marigold Hunt retells the stories of the Acts of the Apostles she also adds her own narration explaining the hows and whys of what was going on. The big deal here is that the Apostles were trying to spread the Good News to the world as they knew it, while at the same time trying to get Jews (and often themselves) to understand that Jesus, and thus Christianity, was not reserved only for Jews who followed the Old Laws but for Jew & Gentile alike, that the Old Laws didn't matter to a new non-Jewish Christian, the New Way (which included many of the old laws but really only a fraction) was all that was required of a Christian, Jew or Gentile. This was an awkward period of history and a difficult time to preach in. Ms. Hunt keeps this social commentary in our minds as she relates the 28 chapters of the Acts of Apostles. My son has grown richly in his faith. I credit this book with a part in that. He has started retelling these events to me as examples in life and for myself I will say that the Introduction alone gave me greater insight into the social world the Apostles lived in and I read The Acts with new eyes now with a deeper understanding.

In fact, there's not a whole lot you'll learn about anything or anyone having to do with the series. Don't get me wrong. THE BEATRICE LETTERS is fun. It's gorgeously packaged. It comes with a poster, a dossier of sorts that contains letters to Beatrice and letters from Beatrice. It has ingenious pop-out letters that you can use to attempt to decode a number of anagrams. It has business cards. It has pictures of a metal tool and a paperweight. It has, in fact, all manner of beautifully put together items that tell you nothing.

9780448428567,"Reason for Reading: Read aloud to ds as part of our history curriculum. This is a basic biography of Amelia Earhart focusing on her accomplishments though it does tell her life story from her childhood onwards. The brief opening chapter explains how Amelia's name is nowadays associated with her disappearance and death, but that this book is not about her end but about her life. It gives a good look at Earhart's progress to becoming a pilot and her motivation to setting records, as well as exploring her impact on women of the time. An interesting aspect that I enjoyed was that within each chapter there is a time-out page which will give a brief explanation of a topic that has come up in the text, such as World's Fairs, the Wright brothers, Lindbergh, the depression, etc. One must just stop reading the story and take time-out to read them but they do add another dimension to the book that I enjoyed, especially seeing as the story was not particularly gripping. It does its job well, is a pleasant enough read but there is no connection for the reader with Amelia and no attempt made to make one. The illustrations, which are profuse with one on every single page, are not highly attractive, faces are usually at such a distance that a few lines will suffice for facial details and they are filled with cross-hatching and lines to fill in spaces. My son listened contentedly to the story, asked questions and was interested. But after seeing the first few illustrations had no desire to sit beside me and look at the pictures.

Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, a revered member of the Herpetological Society, is a man who has spent his life studying snakes. As the children arrive at his home, via Lousy Lane, they are at first leary of ""Uncle Monty"" and his REPTILE ROOM. They soon learn, however, that their newfound Uncle is a kind man, providing them each with their own room and entertaining activities that they each enjoy--space and materials to invent for Violet, books and a reading nook for Klaus, and plenty of biting material for Sunny. As the orphans settle in to their new abode, Uncle Monty teaches them about snakes, most especially his new discovery, the Incredibly Deadly Viper. As we learn that said snake is a misnomer--the word ""misnomer"" here meaning ""a wrong name""--the children become excited about the upcoming trip to Peru to study new snake life. Unfortunately, as most everything in the lives of the Baudelaire children is, Uncle Monty's new assistant, Stefano, is no other than Count Olaf in disguise. Alas, just as with their previous adventures, no one listens to the children's concerns until it is too late. As Stefano aka Count Olaf threatens the children into silence, he begins to hatch his evil plan, which includes getting rid of the snake-loving doctor and absconding to Peru with the children, where he can wait for Violet to come of age, grab her fortune, and dispose of the children. Saved in the nick of time--yet again--by a convoluted series of events, we find the children once again looking for a kind relative to care for them. As THE REPTILE ROOM ends, Mr. Poe drives off into the sunset with a miserable Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, and we wait to see which new series of unfortunate events will befall the children.

9780375855726,"In the fourth book of Ember, we enter with the newly unified town of Sparks preparing for the winter, a few months after the city of Ember's emergence from underground. Supplies are growing sparse and sickness becomes abundant in this town, as they question their sustainability for the harsh cold of wintertime. Protagonists Doon and Lina set off on another adventure, based on a prophecy from a book stating their is something left ""for the people of Ember"" that will aid them through the winter. They venture back to their old town of Ember to seek out supplies that their old community has left behind, where they meet an unlikely foe and seek out this mysterious, perhaps magical device to ""bring light to a dark world."" Through the motif of hope, DuPrau illustrates an exciting page-turner that had me up all night so I could finish. Though lacking as much thought and depth as the initial book in the series, the author creates an interesting storyline along with introducing peculiar side characters such as Washton Trogg. The end of the book seems a bit anticlimactic, as their adventure ends sort of to a nothingness, with DuPrau feeling a look to the future as sufficient hope for the success of mankind and their moral triumphs. Otherwise, THE DIAMOND OF DARKHOLD should not disappoint avid readers of the series. In order to grasp full meaning of the story, I would highly suggest reading at least books one and two (three is a prequel to the first and has little overlap). Overall, Duprau succeeds in this installment and I would recommend it to those who have enjoyed the first of her books.",TeensReadToo

Although it doesn't come from from a Christian perspective exactly, this particular book infused something Christian-related into the plot---VERY, very good, Jude Watson!

9780141332482,"When I was a wee little thing I happened to come across the 1994 animated film adaptation of this believed children's classic and fell in love with it. It wasn't until recently (this year) that I realized that it was based on a classic piece of children's literature so when I found out I did some investigating and downloaded the kobo e-book version onto my BlackBerry and before I knew it I was reading it every chance I got. Right away though I noticed that there were of course some key differences. Since the movie I watched was a 1994 film there were some changes made to the story line. It was made to be more accessible to the modern audience but for what it was I enjoyed the book version as well. The story was a fun one and normally I'm not one for the classics but this was a good one. It was enjoyable though I sometimes felt that the story lacked the flow of a more modern novel but that is in part due to the audience it was written for back in 1872. For me, while my tastes are lean towards the more modern I did enjoy the book. I though Irene was a cute character. Her curiosity while it almost lead to her ruin was adorable to see play out on the pages, though I didn't like the demeaning way she treated Curdie the local boy who saved hers and her nursemaid's skin one night. Then again she was a princess and a very young one at that so I suppose I could excuse her attitude. Curdie though had to be my favourite character because of how smart, self reliant and courageous manner. He was the main character for me because much of the book centered around his activities in finding the goblins, and figuring out their master plan. The writing wasgood, it intrigued me but as I stated before the flow put me off a bit. I think that it was a lovely little children's classic and it deserves a spot on every kid's bookshelf because their a princess for the girls to admire and a hero for the boys. Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone young and old. This would be a good book for a night time read aloud book for kids or to be read by teachers to their classes. I'm a strong believer that though a book is older it should not lose its place on out bookshelves. I plan on reading the sequel to this book in 2013.",Kimberly Roy

9780440229124,"Reason for Reading: This is another book from the Randomly Selected Bookshelf that I am reading from this year. I'm pretty sure I've read this before but it must have been as a kid, because I didn't really remember the story. My son loves shipwreck/survival stories so this one will definitely be going in the bedtime reading pile for his dad to read to him. Phillip is twelve and lives in the West Indies, has ever since he was four, on the island of Curacao. World War II is in full swing, the year is 1940 and the West Indies have refineries which are supplying gas, kerosene, etc. But the German U-Boats have finally come to strike this important part of the Allied War Effort. Phillip's mother has always hated it here and wanted to go back to Virginia; she also is very prejudiced against the black people and tells Phillip her racist thoughts frequently, though he has never seen her point. He enjoys going down to the docks and watching the West Islanders work and talking to them. After the bombing she insists that it is time she take Philip back home but their ship is torpedoed and Philip ends up on a raft with a ""Negro"", Timothy. Philip has been injured on the back of the head by something very hard and goes in and out of consciousness, though he soon gets better except for the sore head. Part of the story tells of their survival on the raft, they have water and food which Timothy rations strictly. Their relationship is strained. Timothy doesn't talk much, works to keep them alive and is often blunt and to the point, though never rude. Philip takes this the wrong way, starts to think maybe his mother is right and blacks are different, which makes Philip take a haughty tone with Philip. The second part of the story deals with their survival on the uninhabited little island they drift upon. It has no fresh water and they depend on the rain, but food is plentiful. Philips eyesight starts to go grey until he is eventually goes blind but before this happens he and Timothy have an argument where Philip calls him racial names. Their strained relationship is at an apex. Philip's blindness creates an entire new meaning to the word survival and with the whole world dark he reexamines what black and white mean. This is a fantastic story of survival, friendship, race relations, love and truth. The book has a few exciting moments when extreme events happen but mostly it is a more realistic, quiet, day in, day out, survival story where the relationship between Timothy and Phillip is as much what the story is about as how they manage to survive so long on that island. A good book. One that boys will especially enjoy. Also recommended for older reluctant readers because of its mature storyline and short number of pages.",Nicola Mansfield

9780060882099,"The fourth tale of Septimus Heap delivers action, adventure, magic, and a good share of surprises. The tale begins when Nicko Heap and Snorri, who in a previous book found themselves transported out of their own Time, discover a clue that might allow them to return to their home Time. However, the path home is a tricky one: Nicko and Snorri must find their way to the mysterious House of Foryx, ""the place where all Times do meet."" Once they are there, the difficulties are not over. Finding and entering the House of Foryx is hard enough, but once they are in, they must wait for someone from their own Time to enter before they will be able to leave and return home. Meanwhile, the notes regarding Nicko and Snorri's preparations for this journey have survived until Septimus's time, under the care of the long-lived alchemist Marcellus Pye. Using the notes and lists that Nick has left behind, Septimus and Jenna are able to figure out what it is that Nicko and Snorri are attempting, and set off to reach the House of Foryx themselves, so that their appearance might allow Nicko and Snorri to return to the correct Time. However, their plans are complicated by the pernicious ghost of Tertius Fume, who contrives to send Septimus against his will on a Queste from which no apprentice wizard has ever returned. While the plot rambled in places, I enjoyed the overall arc of the story, and in the end I was glad for the slow development at the beginning which built up to the climax. Sage's characterization was impressive; I got a good idea of the relationships that had formed between characters in previous books, as well as a sense of their internal states and motivations. Her large cast of secondary characters was deftly managed as well. As a newcomer to the series, getting my bearings was slightly confusing, but after a while I began to understand the backstory better, thanks to the author's hints and insinuations at what had happened before this book. There were still moments when I felt like I was missing out on something--moments where I was sure that the emotional impact would have been greater had I read the previous three books in the series--but overall I was still able to enjoy it, and would recommend it thoroughly.",TeensReadToo

There are a few bullies and a few annoying ones, but overall, Holling is looking forward to a new year. Unfortunately, the first Wednesday of the new year reveals a not-so-pleasant surprise. Every Wednesday afternoon beginning just before 2:00pm everyone leaves his classroom. That is, everyone except Holling and Mrs. Baker. What happens is, the Catholic half of the class is taken by bus to attend Catechism class, and the Jewish half of the class goes to Hebrew School at the temple. Since the Hoodhood family attends the Presbyterian Church, Holling stays put in the classroom. Needless to say, Holling realizes quite quickly that Mrs. Baker is rather disappointed. If all the students were to leave on Wednesday afternoons, she would have a peaceful chunk of time to catch up on grading papers and making lesson plans. Alas, Mrs. Baker must find ways to occupy Holling instead. There are days when Holling is pretty certain that Mrs. Baker hates him. Typical Holling-type chores include cleaning the erasers, washing the chalkboard, cleaning the cage of the classroom's pet rats, and doing extra worksheets. One afternoon when Holling was preparing for his usual Wednesday assignment, Mrs. Baker surprised him with a new idea. He was going to begin reading Shakespeare. Soon, Wednesday afternoons become quite interesting. In addition to the classroom elements of the story, readers get an inside view of life in the Hoodhood home. Holling's father is an ambitious architect, his mother is an obedient housewife, and his sister is a ""flower child"" out to change the Vietnam-era world. Gary D. Schmidt presents the world of middle school in THE WEDNESDAY WARS. Every student's nightmare and every teacher's dream - one-on-one instruction. Schmidt fills the pages with sentence diagramming, vicious yellow-toothed rats, luscious cream puffs, chalk dust, yellow tights with feathered bottoms, as well as serious subjects like Shakespeare, architecture, politics, the Vietnam War, and growing up in the 60's.

9780060577339,"I've been hankering for a good midde grade book for a while, and I remember reading this a long time ago after it first came out and not being about to get through it because of the length. I was a lot younger then, so a 600 page book was extremely intimidating. I decided to give it another go, and I blasted through it full-speed. I was so enamored of the world-building, the crazy creatures, the quirky characters, and the magykal spells. While I still think this would be a difficult read for a middle grade student because of the length, I think they would also have some issues with explanations of the rules of magyk and the world. Everything is very mysterious, secretive, and left up to the imagination, and while I think this works in some cases, I don't think the rules were explained enough right off the bat, especially for younger readers. That was another reason why I initially hadn't enjoyed the book when I was younger, because I didn't know where the story was going, what what people with magykal abilities were actually capable of. I also thought that some of the situations and descriptions of characters were strange for the sake of being strange. A lot of the filler scenes were unnecessary for that reason. The plot needed to be focussed, but instead it was haphazard, and the pace erratic. However, I loved the characters. There is a mix of young and old, human and non-human narratives intertwined in the story, and it was extremely interesting enjoying getting into their thoughts and the reasons behind their actions. Every character had their faults and their strengths. Jenna was very determined and loyal, but a little bit bossy. Nicko was a great sailor, but he was in his own little world most of the time. Boy 412 is heroic, but hesitant and uneager at first to get caught up in the conflicts of the other characters. Marcia Overstrand is very proud, but she is also extremely powerful and also patient with her charges. The villain in this case really fell short for me because he wasn't evil enough. DomDaniel is just described as silly and smelly. I wish he had more of a fear factor. I think this is a great start to middle grade series, especially for lovers of fantasy and quirky creatures and characters that never cease to surprise you. Angie Sage beautifully describes her settings and her characters' thoughts, and she really focusses on the power of family.",Janita Van Dyk

9780060577339,"If you've been looking for a series that combines the magic of Harry Potter with the imaginative characters of Artemis Fowl, then Septimus Heap and his first book, MAGYK, is definitely the story for you. A quick, delightful read that can stand on its own, MAGYK is, without a doubt, an intriguing page-turner. Septimus Heap, the seventh son of a seventh son, died shortly after birth. Born to a family of Wizards, there's no telling what he might have become, as his lineage as a seventh son would have made him unbelievably magical. But on that winter night when Septimus died, his father, Silas, found another newborn child in the forest. They named her Jenna, and she grew up thinking that she was the daughter of Silas and Sarah Heap, and the sister of six older brothers--Simon, Sam, Edd, Erik, Nicko, and Jo-Jo. Early on, though, Sarah had her own ideas of who Jenna really was, especially when she heard the news that the Queen had been murdered. Jenna Heap was, undoubtedly, the Princess. Over the next ten years, darkness came to the Castle and the Ramblings, where the Heaps lived. With no Queen, evil came in the form of the Supreme Custodian, who along with his cohorts banned magic and ended the happiness the Queen's people had once known. As the Heap family attempt to ride out this time of darkness, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand, learns of the plot to kill the Princess, which will allow evil to truly take over the Palace. It seems that the only thing keeping DomDaniel, the Dark Wizard, from returning to the Castle is the presence of the Princess, and he plans to remedy that. What follows is the flight of Jenna, Nicko, the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, and a Young Army recruit known only as Boy 412 to the Marram Marshes, where Aunt Zelda Heap, a White Witch, will be able to keep them from harm. As events unfold and DomDaniel does everything within his power to track down the girl standing between him and a ruling darkness, the Heap family will have to do everything within their means to stop him--and at the same time stay alive. MAGYK is a delightful, entertaining story filled with action-adventure and fantasy. With a very large cast of characters who are as diverse as they come, this is one story not to be missed. If you like Harry Potter, you will definitely enjoy Septimus Heap. Filled with twists and turns, this is a story you'll stay up reading long into the night. And although at times predictable, you'll quickly be drawn into the life and times of the Heap family and their magical world. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780553262148,"This was a WONDERFUL sequel to the first Emily book. I honestly can't decide which book was better than the other. Parts of the book are in diary form, while others are set in regular story form, so you get an all-around view of Emily's life. I like how the author weaved the two forms together. I loved the storyline; it seems like very simple, little things that take place, but as you reflect on it, you realize the story is actually quite deep in thought, and well plotted. Emily is allowed to attend the Shrewbury school where her friends are going. However, the rule is that she must live with grumpy, old Aunt Ruth, who seemingly has stricter rules than Aunt Elizabeth did when Emily lived with her. And Aunt Ruth is always accusing Emily of being sly, which runs down Emily's patience. During the time that Emily lives with her Aunt Ruth, she is not allowed to write fiction, which seems to put a damper on Emily's future career of writing. Her old teacher, who has helped guide her [Mr. Carpenter] says the time away from fiction will improve Emily's writing ability.

Things turn quite dark in this volume as we finally meet the bad guy and see him surrounded by his minions. He wears a costume that hides his actual identity and it makes me wonder whether if and when his hood is lifted we might see a familiar face in the end. Great story with some multiple plot lines going on; first and foremost the Lord of the Locusts is gathering the rat creatures to help him take over the valley, Thorn learns her true identity and fights a battle with King Dok, and as usual Phoney Bone is up to his usual scams this time scaring the villagers into believing that they are under eminent attack by dragons and he, a true dragonslayer, is the only one who can help them.

9780060577391,"I have to state that it's taken me a very long time to write my review of PHYSIK, mostly because it took me such a very long time to finish the book. Although I absolutely loved MAGYK, and was nearly as impressed with FLYTE, it was much harder for me to get into the story of PHYSIK. I wasn't immediately struck by the newly introduced characters, and even some of my old favorites were, at first, acting quite different than they had originally. That being said, though, I'm glad I finally finished this third installment in the Septimus Heap saga, and can recommend it to others without feeling guilty. The story opens with Silas Heap, father of the Heap clan, unknowingly unleashing the ghost of Queen Etheldredda, a Castle Queen who ruled long ago. Along with her spirit is also released that of her pet Aie-Aie, a rat-dog-snake hybrid that is hideous to look upon. Although Silas and his companion, Gringe, aren't first aware of what has happened, they'll soon learn that the room they unlocked would have been better left alone. Nearly at the same time, Snorri Snorrelssen, a young North Trader, arrives at Sally Mullen's Tea and Ale House -- and can immediately sense that she's not welcome there, even if she can't understand the language that's being spoken. After weeks at sea, however, Snorri is not about to turn her back on her mission, that of following in the footsteps of her father. Back at the Palace, Septimus Heap is putting off his studies with ExtraOrdinary Wizard Marcia Overstrand, instead indulging in his new obsession of learning all there is to know about Alchemy. He wishes to learn under the famous Alchemyst Marcellus Pye, who just so happens to be the son of the dreaded Queen Etheldredda. All of the usual characters are back in this installment: Jenna, Nicko, Aunt Zelda, Spit Fyre, and Alther Mella, along with new ones like the above-mentioned Snorri and Marcellus Pye. Some of them act as they've always acted; some of them act in surprising ways. All of it leads up to a showdown of wits and talents and, of course, the next book in the series. As I said, I'm glad I finally finished reading PHYSIK, as I definitely plan to read QUESTE, the fourth book.

And while it was pretty good overall, it still didn't hit a few marks I wish it would have. The book does a great job at keeping you entertained with no lull in-between plot points. But it does so at the expense of it feeling rushed. I don't know if it's just because I've played these games so I realize that it really took Link something like 5 hours to do this part, and so to sum it up in 3 pages is a little lackluster. I think I would have just appreciated it more if they slowed it down and just let the story take longer to tell. I've seen reviews that comment on the art being too kiddy, but I think it fit perfectly for the book. I mean it's about the Ocarina of Time, and him going from a little kid to an adult.

She hasn't spoken to him in exactly one year, ever since she heard him say those nasty things about her at their last joint birthday party.

With that said, the book is still interesting, well-written and makes you want to read the rest of the series.",Maria Radman
9780142414330,"This was a really fun book to read. Mississippi, aka Mibs, and her family each get a magical gift, called a savvy, on their thirteenth birthday. Rocket, Mibs's brother, has the savvy of being able to control electricity. He is a lot like those comic book heroes, good-looking with electric sparks coming off of his hands. At thirteen, her other brother, Fish, found out that he can control weather, especially causing water storms. So at thirteen the kids become homeschooled and have to learn how to control their special abilities. When the story opens, Mibs is two days away from turning thirteen herself. She is excited about her special birthday when her father is in a horrible twelve-car accident on the highway. He ends up in a coma in a hospital in Salina, Kansas. When she gets her savvy, she is being taken care of by the minister's wife and all she can think of is how to get to her Poppa. Mibs, Fish, her little brother, Samson, and two of the minister's kids run away to find Poppa. SAVVY is the story of their adventures crossing Nebraska and Kansas, trying to control savvys, which is called scumbling, learning to see the good in people, and, of course, the courage it takes to act on your ideals and love. I loved the writing in this book. The author uses a lot of figurative language. Besides metaphor and simile, Ingrid Law also uses a lot of alliteration in the telling of the story. Phrases such as pushing-pulling waves, itch and scritch of birthday buzz, or how about a gaggle of flat-footed goslings. It was remarkable how the author could use language to make this story even better than it already was. So if you want to read a really good story about growing up or if you just love the sound of language, then this is the book for you. Have a really rad read! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780060577360,"Septimus Heap, seventh son of a seventh son, has settled into his life as the Apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard. Formerly thought to be only an orphan boy serving in the Young Army, it was quite a shock to the Heap family when they discovered that Boy 412 was actually their youngest son, who they believed had died after childbirth. Now that Marcia Overstrand has taken Septimus back to the Wizard Tower as her Apprentice, Septimus is truly learning how to use the Magyk that flows strongly through his lineage. Although DomDaniel is believed dead after the wreck of his boat, and, in fact, the end of the first book in the series saw his skeleton sinking to the bottom of the Marram Marshes, not all members of the Heap family are happy to have the prodigal son return. Simon Heap, the oldest of Silas and Sarah's sons, had always hoped to gain the apprenticeship to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard. When that goal was thwarted by the reappearance of young Septimus, Simon's anger turned to revenge. After rescuing the bones of DomDaniel, the evil Wizard, from a watery grave, Simon disappeared into the Badlands, much to the worry and horror of his family. Nearly a year has passed, and Jenna, the Princess who will one day become Queen, is enjoying the quiet, peaceful life in the Palace. She has settled into her life on the Palace grounds, once again happy and secure. Nicko Heap has taken a job at the boatyard; the four wild Heap children are still living in the Forest with Wolf Boy; Septimus is learning the ways of Magyk. All is well until one day when Simon Heap, surrounded by Darkness, rushes onto the Palace grounds upon a black horse and kidnaps Jenna, taking her away to the Badlands. Simon, who now considers himself to be the Apprentice of evil DomDaniel, knows he must get rid of the Princess, and his brother, Septimus, if he has any chance of returning to the Wizard Tower as ExtraOrdinary Wizard one day. Bent on revenge, he has a plan to get DomDaniel back into a position of power, and it is up to Jenna, Septimus, Nicko, Aunt Zelda, the entire Heap family, and the Dragon Boat to make sure that doesn't happen. FLYTE is a great follow-up to book one, MAGYK. The Septimus Heap series continues to delight, with its introduction of new characters, intriguing plot lines, and great dialogue.

9781416940289,"This story takes place in 1864, on the Wisconsin frontier. The book follows the adventures of a certain girl, named Caddie Woodlawn. She is a tomboy, who likes to run around wildly with her two brothers, rather than staying inside and doing the tasks that are expected of her, like sewing, knitting, and cooking, with her mother and her older sister, Clara. Living in territory where Indians are nearby, excitement is always brewing. There are fish to catch, rafts to paddle, fields to plow, and school lessons to learn. Caddie's adventures were loosely based on the author's own grandmother. I think that makes the book interesting, to know that some of the events actually happened, and that the characters were based on real people. I recommend this book for either boys or girls. I think it was quite a fun read, and good for any age.",Tarissa
9781442429345,"Enthralling and really enjoyable. John Connolly cleverly twisted the stories we knew and loved and turned them into more fascinating a?? albeit sinister a?? tales. I must admit that I only found things interesting when David got into the forest. But from then, I was hooked. I liked the mystery and the thrill of the adventure a?? for it was an adventure, however dangerous it was. I liked the people David met and who helped him: the Woodsman, Roland, Anna and even the dwarfs. I liked how David transformed from a sad and frightened boy into a brave child capable of helping and saving others and himself. Above all, I liked that he learned his lesson and made amends with people in his life. There were heartbreaking times but there were also moments of triumph. I think both helped David change into a child ahead of his years. And ita??s not necessarily a bad thing because he learned a lot through his journey that made him a better person. I especially liked the twists in the story: the identity and the story of the king, who the Crooked Man was, the reappearance of a friend towards the end, the reason why there are Loups and other sinister creatures in the forest. Everything was well-thought of and well-executed. Davida??s adventure intertwined with a darker version of the fairy tales made up for a very engrossing story. The ending reminded me of The Chronicles of Narnia. Like the Pevensie siblings with Narnia, David returned to the forest in the end, just like what the Woodsman said. And I imagined it to be a bittersweet reunion because while David left his world, he returned to a land wherein he had a great adventure and learned a lot. THE BOOK OF LOST THINGS is a beautiful amazing book. Recommended to readers of all ages. I loved it.",Julie Rimpula
9780060530921,"Tonight, I was supposed to be at a concert. Totally slipped off my mind, for various reasons, but this got me around to finishing reading my first Gaiman book. I've heard not long ago of Neil Gaiman, brought to my attention by a fellow reader who mentioned ""American Gods"". Thought that would be interesting, never got around to actually buying and reading it. And then I realised Gaiman also wrote Stardust, which I had previousely watched in cinema, and... liked... Third time's a charm, they say. And when Romanian Publishing House NEMIRA announced they were preparing 2009 Hugo Award winning The Graveyard Book, I finally decided I had to read something by Neil Gaiman. Enters Bookdepository, a recently discovered friend in terms of books, and here we are. That's the story behind getting to read indeed one of the best piecese of fantasy I've read in a while. I'm not going to tell you much details about the story inside the book, as I am sure Gaiman fans already know about it. Ok, maybe just a little, just a teasing hint of what macabres awaits you in the shadows... For some personal reasons, my most favourite writing for children (and grown-ups, even) has been Kippling's The Jungle Books. Have you read it? It's a fascinating story of a boy grown by a wolves' family, somewhere in the Indian jungle. Well, the story in The Graveyard Book is... the story of an orphaned boy that ends up in a graveyard and is raised, exactly, by its inhabitants. The chapters are written in the tone of short stories and introduce the reader to a fascinating world of the dead, the living, and the inbetween: you've got the regular inhabitants of graveyards, and then there's Silas. You've got ghouls, and then there's Miss Lupescu. You've got the living that dance with the dead, the drowned and burned witch of the potter's field, the poet, the architect, the doctor, the Roman,... and then there's the Jacks-of-all-trades, the ones that killed the boy's family in the first act. Years pass-by and our protagonist gets to learn the ways of the dead, the ways of the living, what it's like to live among the dead and what it's like to feel the envy of the living. Each chapter has its own charm, every phrase lets you wondering what's he going to do next, and every character fits into the scene as a piece of the puzzle. Even if the story is chronologically linear, it's only in the end that you get to see all pieces of the graveyard puzzle come into place, to succumb to the alert writing, to want more, to hope, to fear, to wish, to long, to dispair and to finally accept. Of all characters, brilliantly presented by the author, my favourites (and probably not only mine), were obviousely Silas, the boy's Guardian, neither dead nor living, and Miss Lupescu, the boy's teacher. Silas is a member of the Honour Guard and it is hinted at that he is a vampire, but never out-right stated in the book (yet Gaiman has confirmed Silas as a vampire in interviews). In regards of Miss Lupescu, I will only tell my non-Romanian readers that her name is Romanian and comes from Lup (= wolf) and escu (common Romanian name suffix). Now go figure what she can do... :D Hmm... looks like I haven't said much of the main character, the baby that survives the killing... Oh well, that's because he's just... Nobody... :D Ok, enough is enough, I should rest here and not spoil the goods for you guys out there wanting to read the book. It's a great children's fantasy novel and I definitely recommend it for lecture, for your child, or for the child in you...",Dorin Emanoil PIRVU
9780064408639,"The Austere Academy is the fifth book in A Series of Unfortunate Events by American author, Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler). As we once again join the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, Mr Poe deposits the siblings at a boarding school, the Prufrock Preparatory School, with an advanced computer that will protect them from Count Olaf. Or will it? Having already suffered the loss of their parents, the threat of marriage, slave labour, hypnosis, and the murder of their Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine at the hands of the evil Count Olaf and his nefarious assistants, the siblings are ever-vigilant of his reappearance. Luckily these well-mannered and uncomplaining children are also very resourceful: Violet invents, Klaus reads and Sunny bites. Snicket's tone throughout is apologetic, sincere and matter-of-fact as he relates the unfortunate events in the children's lives; his imaginative and even surreptitiously educational style will hold much appeal for younger readers. Snicket's word and phrase definitions are often hilarious. This instalment, the orphans manage to make friends with two triplets who are in a similar situation. But it isn't enough to save them from horrible living conditions, enduring boring lessons and nasty teasing classmates, or in Sunny's case, secretarial duties, as well as cruel punishments like torture by violin recital, toe-nipping crabs and nightly running exercises. Violet turns her inventing skills to staple manufacture, Klaus manages to read important notes without his glasses and Sunny's vocabulary seems to be improving. The alliterative titles are a delight and Brett Helquist provides his usual wonderfully evocative illustrations. What will happen to the orphans now that they have been expelled? No doubt the sixth instalment, The Ersatz Elevator, will reveal all.",Marianne Vincent

9780152058104,"Last weekend I participated in a read-a-thon in one of my Goodreads groups and I was choosing to read some children's classics that I haven't read before and of course I just had to give Mary Poppins a try. I vaguely remember my dad reading it to me as a kid but most of my memories are of the movie version of the book so I thought it was high time I give the book a try. Sadly, my expectations of the fun, bubbly and witty Mary Poppins were met with disappointment. The book follows Mary Poppins from the moment she arrives at Number Seventeen Cherry-Tree Lane to take become a nanny for the four Banks children to the moment she suddenly leaves them in the end of the book. I have to say that I was expecting something altogether different than what I got from reading this children's classic and perhaps it's because as we age the books we read as children lose some of their magic as some of our inherent innocence is taken from us in the aging process. I didn't find the first book in the Mary Poppins series to be an enjoyable read except for the parts where Mary Poppins wasn't in it. I thought that Mary Poppins was a dour brute in a nanny suite. She was rude, unkind and completely self absorbed and thought she was the best at everything. I found that rather than lift the book up and make it a fun and enjoyable read she brought it down. Despite the fact that I couldn't really stand Mary Poppins I did enjoy reading about the other characters in the book and I especially loved the twins as I thought they were little darlings. Of course I also liked the characters that Mary Poppins introduced the children too and they funny, sweet and of course eccentric. Also the writing was very good. Just because I didn't like the main character it doesn't mean the author wasn't talented she was immensely talented in fact and the story flowed wonderfully. Overall, while I did enjoy all but one aspect of the novel I just can't get past my dislike for the literary Mary Poppins and I much prefer the film version to this. However I do plan on adding these to the list of books I keep in case I ever have children because I think this is one that kids will enjoy as long as they haven't seen the movie I think and I still plan on reading the entire series and I just hope I come to like it more as it goes on. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it yet and just because I found it lacking that's not to say that you will. It is one I think everyone should give a chance and prove that just because a book is ""old"" or written in a by gone era that it should not be forgotten and left to collect dust.",Kimberly Roy
9781402238253,"Reason for Reading: Our son has reading difficulties and after much debate the family bought an ereader. Ds read this book aloud as his reader and as his very first ebook. Horrid Henry is a favourite of his. This book was exactly what one expects from Horrid Henry. After having read only the first book in the series ds and I are both fans. Reading this book further along in the series we found two things had changed, Henry has gotten somewhat meaner *but* he usually ends up with the short end of the stick when all is said and done, which makes his escapades easier to swallow when you know he won't totally get away with it. Ds finds Harry funny and is continuously going ""Oh Man!"" with the things he gets up to but ds also thinks Henry is a bit too much and takes things too far. He wouldn't like to have him in his class, that is for sure! We both really enjoyed all the stories in this book and we agree upon our favourite being the titular one where he accidentally wears girl's underwear to school. This book was very hard for ds to read, so we read pretty much in tandem with me reading any words he struggled with to avoid frustration as he thoroughly enjoyed the ebook reading experience and took to it like a fish to water. He says he wants all his books on the Kindle now.

9781416963981,I'm a big fan of young adult/children's novels because sometimes you just want a simple read with a good storyline. This is precisely that. The storyline is one of the best I've come across in awhile for children. It started off a little slow in the first chapter but after that I was hooked. It made me imagine being 10 years younger and the struggles I faced when maturing and letting go of childish things. The book reflects the struggle of growing up while still having a storyline that captures your attention. I recommend this book if you don't mind the idea of creepy little girl ghosts. It's extremely interesting and I'd love a part 2 with the same characters to see what their next adventure is.,N. Rai
9781434234490,"Reason for Reading: I enjoy retellings of Shakespeare rather than reading the olde English (which I did plenty of at one time.) I've read a couple of children's retellings of this play, and seen the old b/w version of the movie with Mickey Rooney plus seen it performed live once. I cannot recall if I've read the original play. As to the original story, I am only somewhat partial to it. I guess you could say it fits in the middle group of the Shakespeare plays I love, I think are OK, and I hate. This one can be quite confusing since it is two stories in one containing a play within a play. The main story is set in Ancient Greece and revolves around two couples in love, though not happily paired off, more of a triangle with an odd man out. These characters' king and queen are being entertained by a troupe of players who are putting on a play which is based on ""Pyramus and Thisbe"" (the same play Shakespeare based Romeo and Juliet upon). Both the star-crossed lovers and the troupe players enter the woods and get caught up in the faerie realm where tricks are played, go wrong and cause much confusion, as typical in a Shakespeare comedy. This is a very nice retelling. The format is well done with a two page spread showing the main characters to start off with. Divisions separating the play into the original five acts and an informational note at the end on the ""History Behind the Play"". The writing, while adapted for young readers, keeps the formality of the original and keeps the prose poetic even though no longer in verse. One must keep one's wits about them to keep the story in order as a lot goes on in this play while keeping the s*xuality of the original at bay. I love the illustrations in this adaptation; they are bold, bright and farcical, while many of the characters have a slight manga look about them which all goes toward making the book visually appealing. This would be an excellent resource to use along side the study of the original play for older ages. The younger end of the age group would do well to read a short summary of the play first perhaps by the Lambs or Nesbit.",Nicola Mansfield

Troy and his mother have each other to survive; they aren't rich or poor but are happy together. But the one thing that separates Troy from every other 12-year-old is his ability to predict what could happen next. He can't predict what he might get on his next exam at school or what will happen to him in the next ten years, though. Instead, Troy can predict football plays before they even happen. Sounds cool, right? But what good is it if Troy can hardly use this gift? Then Troy's mom gets a job with his favorite team, the Atlanta Falcons, who aren't doing so well and have been basically losing all of the time. This seems like the perfect chance for Troy to help them out, and maybe they could finally win a game. But would the Falcons jump at the chance and actually believe that a young boy can predict plays, or would they just look at Troy as some crazy fan? With the help of Tate and Nathan, Troy's best friends, Troy might actually pull this off and maybe even learn a little more about his talents, other than his supernatural one. FOOTBALL GENIUS is a story that both football lovers and non-football fans will enjoy along with any person of any age.

9780689711305,"Reason for Reading: read aloud to the 10yo as part of our history curriculum. This is a gentle, quiet story that is suitable for younger children (as a read loud) since it deals with the very early days of Hitler's Germany, making one aware of the need for escape in those early days and how fortunate were those who did manage to leave Germany before the atrocities began. The story is told from Lisa's point of view, the second oldest girl of three, perhaps 11 years old. Their father has decided that they will leave for America, so he goes first in order to get a job, a place to live and earn enough money for the tickets for boat passage for the others. Lisa, Ruth (the older sister), little Annie and mother must now fend for themselves until the time comes. The reader learns what it was like in Germany for the Jews in those early days as their rights were slowly being taken from them. Then father tells them they must go to Switzerland for safety immediately and here the majority of the book takes place as the three girls and the mother are separated from each other as they are looked after by different refugee helper families. They don't loose contact though and life goes on through this tough and emotional time for them until finally just after hearing devastating news from Berlin, Father sends the boat tickets for them to join him. An interesting story, full more of personal drama set against the background of a turbulent time rather than outside drama of the era since we are only at the very beginnings of Hitler's Germany here. A tale that tells the pressure of leaving one's home and becoming refugee status in another country, accepting help but really unable to do much for oneself, the waiting for the future to come and the worry for the loved ones left behind. A nice story, ds and I both enjoyed it well. The art on the otherhand leaves something to be desired. I'll admit I've never been fond of Charles Robinson.

After Ida's best friend moves away, she's sure she'll never have another friend like Elizabeth. Until the day the new girl, Stacey Merriweather, smiles at her. The thing I love most about this book is the way Ida thinks: ""She's smiling at you with the kind of smile you don't see on a real person very often. The kind you see a little kid draw with a big fat crayon on a piece of white paper. The kind you have to force yourself not to smile back at. Trust me, you don't want to get too close to big-crayon smiles. That's because people with big-crayon smiles don't stick around very long. They move away just when you've gotten used to the way their hand feels sticky when you hold it, or the way they hiccup when they talk fast, or the way they whistle by sucking in instead of blowing out, or the way they can touch their nose with the tip of their tongue."" For Ida, entering the fourth grade without Elizabeth is like diving into the deep end of the pool before she's sure she can swim well enough to get back to the edge. She's got no safety devices and feels like no one is rooting for her as she splashes around and tries not to go under. I don't know about everyone else, but that's exactly how elementary school felt to me sometimes. This is one of those books that comforts its readers with the knowledge that someone gets it.

Marylin continues to hang out with the cheerleaders, although she is gradually beginning to realize that the controlling Mazie does not always have her best interests in mind. When Marylin meets Rhetta, the new girl, she never dreams that they could have so much in common. Rhetta's gorgeous anime drawings of fairies remind Marylin of the stories she constantly imagines but never has the courage to put down on paper. Their unlikely friendship gives Marylin the inspiration to stay a cheerleader but not follow the crowd just for the sake of following. Kate also makes some new and different friendship connections. Who would have guessed that Flannery, who just a year ago had made Kate feel so awful, could possibly become someone with whom she can share some of her most personal thoughts with? When Kate decides to move from an interest in basketball to taking up the guitar, Flannery provides the support and encouragement Kate needs. Kate also finds another musical kindred spirit when she meets Matthew Holler. He is not like the other boys. He recognizes her need to be something other than a girly-girl, and he really listens and cares about the song lyrics she feels driven to create. Both Kate and Marylin realize their friendship will survive the test of time, but they also realize that they will both need other friends to support them as their interests and needs change. Once again, Frances O'Roark Dowell tells a story that will connect with middle grade readers. She covers the topics of struggling friendships, divorcing parents, and the need to be an individual - all subjects that complicate the growing up process.

9780547248189,"THE ADVENTURES OF SIR GIVRET THE SHORT is the second story in the entertaining THE KNIGHTS' TALES series. However, the reader does not have to have read THE ADVENTURES OF SIR LANCELOT THE GREAT to understand or enjoy this story. It is able to stand alone on its own content. When we first meet Givret, he is simply Givret, not a knight. When King Arthur's knights hear of the legend of hunting the white stag and the rewards that catching it would bring, all of them, but for Givret, leave on their quest. Givret volunteers to remain in the castle to protect Queen Guinevere. All should be quiet, but the traveling Sir Yoder arrives in the kingdom and mistakenly insults the Queen. When one of the King's knights, Sir Erec, hears of the insult, he sets off after Sir Yoder (to Scotland) to cleanse Queen Guinevere's name. When the rest of the knights and the King return, Givret tells of the story. Because Givret used his intelligence to dispatch Sir Yoder, King Arthur grants knighthood upon Givret, much to the amusement and bewilderment of the remaining Knights of the Roundtable. Upon knighthood, King Arthur gives Givret a quest. He must follow after Sir Erec to Scotland. Though small in stature and not known for his brute strength, Givret the Short (later to be called Givret the Wise or simply Givret the Marvelous - you have to read the story to learn about THAT one!), Givret proves to the rest of the knights that being brave and true means more than simply fighting a foe with brute strength. Mr. Morris, aided with the entertaining illustrations by Mr. Renier, writes a quirky tale for young readers to enjoy. Using the King Arthur characters and setting, Mr. Morris lets readers know that thinking things through can oftentimes provide the result that is desired. Brute strength doesn't always solve problems. Sir Givret is different from the rest of the knights, but it's his difference that saves the day in the end...many times!",TeensReadToo
9781596434530,"Reason for Reading: My son loves seafaring tales and this looked wonderful. This is a beautiful book to behold. The illustrations are so bold, vibrant and full of details. The panels have so much going on in the background that one can look into them and see something new each time. We are even treated to the occasional two-page spread illustration. While some of these may be focused on a large central figure, the background will still hold many small details that one should linger on so as not to miss, but on the other hand there are a couple of amazingly intricately detailed two-page spreads that just make you want to keep looking to see what you are missing before turning the page. Walker Bean has been sent off to sea by his grandfather, who has commanded Walker's father to return a cursed skull to its rightful place. Knowing that the father will not follow through, probably sell it somewhere, Walker is charged with making sure the job gets done. You see, grandfather bought that skull, looked at it and is now near death's door unless it is returned to its guardians. What follows is a rip-roaring yarn full of sea adventure mostly of the perilous kind. While the story is not a fantasy per se, one must be able to suspend reality while reading of Walker Bean's adventures as they are of the most bizarre nature. Be prepared to meet pirates, a pirate girl who has turned the bow of the ship into a garden complete with lemon tree, great monstrous sea hags of legend and a cursed skull to begin with. Walker is a congenial protagonist who will appeal to all readers, wearing glasses, pudgy, reluctantly on the mission, but brave and determined. On the pirate ship Walker teams up with similarly aged Shiv and Genoa. Shiv is a humorous side-kick who knows his way around a pirate ship and comes up with great plans. Gen on the other-hand is a rather frightening, aggressive girl with red pigtails who is a delightfully enchanting character. Just loved her! A great story and fantastic art combined with thrilling action and outrageously fun characters make this an entertaining seafaring adventure.",Nicola Mansfield
9781419703980,"Reason for Reading: I haven't read the first book in this series (soon to be rectified!) but this sounded so charming I had to go ahead and read it anyway. The portrayal of an Orthodox Jewish family is a breath of fresh air in the book. It is lovely to have God spoken of simply and with reverence in a mainstream book. I enjoyed all the Jewish references to words, customs and culture which made this a unique book in the fantasy genre. A delightful story that had me glued to the pages in one sitting. I fell in love with Mirka and her family and thought this was a special story. Not having read the first book, I know I missed all the references to it in the story but it didn't matter to my enjoyment of this one as a standalone. I can't wait to read the first now though. A really, unique and entertaining main character plus some of the best, realistic dialogue I've ever read make this a fantastic book. I only have one quibble and that is about the author's use of knitting in the story line. He has made a big mistake in using berets for someone who ""lacked patience or skill"". Berets are actually not something a beginner would knit. They are knit in the round and require a lot of decreasing over a large amount of stitches, requiring concentration. They would be knit on 4 needles or a circular needle, switching to 4 needles once nearing the end. The illustrations clearly show Mirka knitting round berets on two straight needles! This is a blunder that any half-accomplished knitter will pick up on right away on page 1! Why didn't the author ask a knitter about this? In this situation, a beginner knitter almost always knits scarfs or shawls. This has brought my rating down to a 4 for an otherwise outstanding book.",Nicola Mansfield

They both come up with the idea of stealing the Golden Howler Monkey statue from a local museum which is about to be demolished so that they may become rich. Along the way the pages have been half illustrated and it is up to the reader to finish the illustrations. The drawing assignments include finishing an already started picture, drawing your own pictures and adding texture to certain already drawn items. There are instructions on what to draw and they range from quite specific to generally broad. Such as draw a parrot on the ledge to who is peeking out of this window. There is also a little bit of writing involved with empty signs for you to label and speech balloon with ideas of what sort of thing to fill in, most often sound effects.

9780439269704,"Reason for Reading: I wouldn't have read this if I hadn't received a review copy but Ryan is the author of one of my son's favourite books that he has had read to him multiple times, Riding Freedom, and I love Peter Sis' artwork. Besides, I always enjoy a good biography, even children's fictional biographies. The poetry angle did worry me though as I am not a fan of poetry in general (except for the silly, rhyming kind ala Shel Silverstien and specific epic poems). This tells the story of Neftali Reyes' childhood, better known by his pen name Pablo Neruda, a great 20th century poet and winner of the Nobel Prize, though I've never heard of him before. And quickly sums up his adulthood in the closing chapters. The last pages include a sampling of his poetry. He had a rough, some would call abusive childhood. A mother who died 2 months after his birth, he and his two siblings were raised by a domineering father who had no patience for daydreaming or idleness. He had worked himself up from poverty and expected his sons to have careers that he never had the opportunity for himself. The eldest son wanted to be a singer, and this was driven out of him brutally by the father who set him up as a businessman after sending him to college. His plans for Neftali were even loftier, expecting him to be a doctor. But Neftali fell short of his expectations in every aspect, being a thin, gangly, weak, sickly child who daydreamed, collected bits and pieces of detritus and loved to write. His father tried everything in his power to drive this creativity out of him, but with the encouragement of a newspaperman Uncle he was able to hold on to his ambition, deep down, until he escaped his father's influence. He did change his name though to save his father from the embarrassment of publicly having a poet and government dissident for a son. The story of Neftali's life is very interesting and the book reads with a gentle poetic flow, in keeping with its subject matter. The book has been printed in green ink as that is how Pablo Neruda himself liked to write. The author Pam Ryan has inserted her own short poetry here and there and the illustrations are accompanied by poetic questions in the form of Neruda's own ""The Book of Questions"". This will all be a bonus to poetry lovers especially those familiar with Neruda himself. Not liking artsy poetry myself, it didn't appeal to me but didn't bother me much either. Also the author has used magical realism to delve inside Neftali's imaginative, daydreaming personality writing his fantasies as if they were indeed happening. For instance, there is a scene where he finds a rhinoceros beetle in the forest for the first time and is fascinated with it, as he watches it, it grows larger and larger until it kneels down its front legs and offers itself to Neftali who then climbs aboard and sets off for a ride through the forest. I am a big fan of magical realism but this didn't work for me in this book as it just came across as a device the author was using to make the book even more artsy and poetic. There are several such episodes but they are not overwhelming. Overall, I really did enjoy the story of Neftali Reyes' childhood and would read his memoirs or a non-fiction biography if I happened to cross paths with them but I was not overly impressed with the artsy-f*rtsy ingredients added to this book and would have much preferred a straight historical fiction. Critics, I'm sure will love the book for its artfulness though.",Nicola Mansfield
9780439269704,"Neftali Reyes is quite the dreamer. He is easily distracted by old boots, unusual umbrellas, or odd-shaped objects.

Will he hold true to what he holds dear? A touching, quick fictionalized biography based on the childhood of Pablo Neruda (born Neftali Reyes). The characters seem believable, and the story is inspirational and does a great job of helping readers relate to Neftali, who grew up to be a Nobel Prize-winning poet.

His death leaves Caitlin and their father alone to pick up the pieces and make some sense of what is left. Being able to mourn and share their grief is complicated by the fact that eleven-year-old Caitlin has a condition known as Asperger's syndrome. She does not recognize most social clues that moderate normal behavior. Unable to interpret simple facial expressions leaves her clueless about how to interact with others. Devon has always bridged the gap between his little sister and the rest of the world, but he is no longer there to help. Caitlin gets some help from Mrs. Brook, a counselor at her school. They spend time every day working on social skills, manners, and what Mrs. Brook calls empathy. Caitlin's very literal approach to situations makes her a target for taunting and teasing that only aggravates the problem. Now, learning to grieve her brother's death is also an important part of her daily therapy. One thing Devon left behind might prove useful as Caitlin and her father attempt to recover and move on. Devon's Eagle Scout project sits unfinished in their living room as a reminder that he will never return to complete it. When Caitlin gets the idea that she and her father could finish the project as a way to find closure, it seems like an impossible task. But with determination and some breakthroughs at school, maybe they can achieve the impossible. MOCKINGBIRD is a heartwarming story of loss and recovery. The addition of Caitlin's struggle with Asperger's adds an amazing element to the tale. Kathryn Erskine recreates the world as seen through Caitlin's eyes in such a realistic and believable way; readers will be drawn in and inspired by this little girl's courage and strength.

9780822564836,"Based on the legendary King Arthur, this English tale has been entertaining audiences since Sir Thomas Malory created the character in the 15th century. Whether or not King Arthur was inspired by a real man has never been determined, but one thing is certain: Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur looked nothing like the Limke-Yeates version. According to Yeates, he used both historic and traditional sources when shaping the artwork for the book. Together, he and Limke created a 21st-century version of Arthur that fans of both Arthurian legend and graphic novels will be unable to resist. Limke's adaptation of Malory's story is strong. This particular telling of the legend begins with the young Arthur, when he was a squire and England was in turmoil, without a king. When he pulls the sword from the stone, he becomes the next king of England--quite a responsibility for a boy. But, with the guidance of Merlin the Magician and the loyalty of the Knights of the Round Table, he becomes a good and powerful leader. The colorful graphics supplied by Yeates are stunning, and the glossary, index, and list of Web sites at the end will enhance this Arthurian experience for younger readers.

It felt likes this is the story Riordan wanted to be telling all along, and that THE SEA OF MONSTERS and THE TITAN'S CURSE were just necessary set-ups. Nico di Angelo has rapidly become a really engaging character, too. I was glad that Riordan finally seemed to find the balance between referencing Greek myths and just retelling them with his characters - sure, we had Percy cleaning out Geryon's stables as Heracles once did, but that was one small, relevant part of a larger quest, not the be all and end all as these ""references"" were in the last two books. The ending had me a bit peeved, though - we keep learning how nutso the gods can be, but when Hera is ****** at Annabeth, she doesn't just smite her. What gives?

9780547414423,"Everyone who has ever seen the original 1947 movie Miracle on 34th Street (we don't like the remakes) knows the basic plot of this book. Kris Kringle is an elderly gentleman who lives at the Maplewood Home for the Aged in New York City, NY. When the Santa hired for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade shows up drunk, Doris Walker, the somewhat frosty, divorced Personnel Director at Macy's, hires Kris to take his place, and Mr. Shellhammer, Head of the Toy Department, suggests that she keep Kris for the permanent job of Santa at Macy's Department Store on 34th St., where he creates a lot of good will which even owner R. H. Macy notices. Kris even affects Doris's daughter, six-year-old Susan, who has been brought up by her disillusioned mother to be as matter-of-fact as herself, and their neighbor and Doris's would-be boyfriend Fred Gailey, a lawyer with whom Kris moves in. Everything is going well until people begin to find out that Kris actually believes that he is the real Santa Claus. So the Macy's company psychologist, Albert Sawyer, who dislikes Santa Claus anyway, decides to have Kris committed to Bellevue insane asylum and does so secretly without Doris's knowledge. When he learns about it, Fred petitions for a court hearing to decide Kris's sanity and determines to have him declared sane. What will happen in court? And how will Susan react? Of course, those who have watched the film know the answer to those questions. Some people have complained that this is a mere ""novelization"" of the movie. Sometimes an existing book is made into a movie, and sometimes an existing movie is ""novelized"" into a book. What happened in the case of Miracle on 34th Street is not so clear. Author Valentine Davies (1905-1961) was a Hollywood screenwriter, but if I understand it correctly, he first wrote it in story form around 1944, then later submitted it to Twentieth Century-Fox, where it was turned into a film. It was decided to publish a book to coincide with the release of the film, so Davies reworked his story, fleshing it out with material from the screenplay. There are some noticeable differences between the movie and the book, but the basic plot is the same. The only objectionable items in the novel are one use of the ""d"" word, one appearance of the term ""Good Lord"" as an interjection, and the fact that Fred smokes a pipe. Otherwise, it is a really cute story.",Wayne S. Walker

At the age of thirteen, it is determined that each citizen is in one of the following groups - Wanteds, Necessaries, or Unwanteds. The Wanteds are a privileged group given the opportunity for higher education and positions of power in society. The Necessaries are just that; they provide the necessary services required in daily life. The Unwanteds are sent to the Death Farm and exterminated. Alex and Aaron are identical twins turning thirteen. They already know their fates. Aaron will stay in Quill and become part of the Quillitary and most likely move up the ranks to become a powerful leader. As a young boy, Alex showed creative tendencies when he was caught drawing in the dirt with a chicken bone. Creativity is not valued in Quill, which means all those with artistic talents are classified as Unwanteds. The departure of the Unwanteds creates barely a ripple in the lives of those left behind in Quill. Alex's parents and brother almost seem annoyed during the brief farewell required when Alex leaves for the Death Farm. He joins the others headed toward their uncertain end, with only a hope that death will come quickly and painlessly. Alex and the others soon find that there is nothing to fear. Upon their arrival, they are welcomed by a mysterious magician named Mr. Today and countless other magical creatures. The world they have entered is called Artime, and it is filled with color and beauty beyond their wildest dreams. It is immediately obvious that life in Artime is all about living and enjoying the creative pursuits they were denied in Quill. After a brief introduction and orientation about the rules and requirements of Artime, Alex and his fellow Unwanteds begin to explore this amazing world. In addition to learning about art, music, and theater, theydevelop their own magical talents. They are free to roam and appreciate all Artime has to offer, but as Alex settles in he learns there is a definite separation between Quill and Artime. No one in Quill must know about the Unwanteds who escaped extermination. Contact with family and friends would threaten this wonderful world's very survival. Author Lisa McMann takes readers on an adventure very different than that in her previous novels. Her creation of these two extremely different worlds creates a sharp contrast that had this reader captivated. The underdog status of the Unwanteds pulled me into the story and had me cheering for them right up through the last page.

It would certainly be interesting to see what Charlotte has learned after this little adventure! Overall; a good paranormal mystery story. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780545723381,"Scholastic, the global children's publishing, education and media company, and the pioneering publisher of the bestselling multi-platform properties The 39 Clues, Infinity Ring and Spirit Animals, announced today that it will publish its next multi-platform series, Tombquest, simultaneously in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in February 2015. The publisher promises to bring the mystery of ancient Egypt to life in this action adventure which will be told in five books by acclaimed author Michael Northrop and linked with an interactive online game. The first title, Book of the Dead, will launch in print and digital formats in February 2015, with the second book to follow in May 2015. The series, aimed at readers ages 8-12 will also feature hidden puzzles and coded messages on the covers which kids can unlock to reveal key plot points. To date, there are more than 22 million copies of Scholastic's industry-leading multi-platform books in print in the United States alone, and its online game community has more than 3 million registrations to date with the average reader spending approximately 26 minutes online. In December 2014, the TombQuest online game will launch in beta format. With TombQuest, Scholastic believes it has developed its most viral game to date, built around the social and interactive concept of ""crate, play and share."" Kids become the ""game masters"" as they design their own ancient Egyptian maze complete with treasure, traps and monsters, and challenge their friends to play. The highly engaging game is complemented by a safe moderated online community where kids have the opportunity to chat about the books, write fan fiction, share the games they have built, and learn about ancient Egypt. The story follows two kids - Alex and his best friend Ren - who awaken the magic of ancient Egypt. When Alex's mother uses the Egyptian Book of the Dead to save him, she cracks open a door to the afterlife accidentally unleashing five evil ancients: the Death Walkers. Alex and Ren must set off on an impossible quest that takes them around the globe - and then into the afterworld - in order to save his mothers and lay the Death Walkers to rest. ""TombQuest is a thoroughly engrossing page-turner that hurtles its characters on a non-stop adventure through the mysteries of ancient Egypt,"" Ellie Berger, President, Scholastic Trade Publishing, said in a statement. ""With the online game, kids are encouraged to broaden their imaginations, create their own worlds, and share them with their friends. TombQuest is the culmination of everything we've learned to date and we look forward to reaching millions of kids worldwide with this immersive new reading experience."" And in a statement to Publishing Perspectives, David Levithan, best-selling author and Vice President, Publisher and Editorial Director, Scholastic added: ""We set the bar in innovative multi-platform publishing almost six years ago with the groundbreaking The 39 Clues, and have since launched subsequent bestselling programs in the multi-platform space. TombQuest combines a fast paced story and a highly immersive online game where kids are encouraged to broaden their imagination, create their own worlds, and share them with their friends. We are excited about this more social approach online which we believe will draw kids back into the world of books.""",Marcus Wong Wen Hao
9781936393589,"Once again we have the joy of another volume of Rust. Everything about it, from the hardcover fabric binding, the extra thick pages and master-crafted story is fantastic. Nothing has changed and no compromise has been made in terms of high production values or unique style. You have to remember to slow your reading right down or this will flash through in minutes. As most of the story is told visually there is very little reading to put the brakes on. This is the epitome of visual storytelling and you the reader feel two steps ahead of the characters. Not because a disembodied narrator has spoon-fed you the watered-down plot but because you use your eyes and your wits to figure things out for yourself. The author trusts you read between the lines and pick up on the subtle cues that he draws in. The art is equally brilliant. A hand painted labour of love with just enough digital magic to draw you in. There is a wonderfully animated chase sequence - just like the first book - whose vast length you don't mind as you are on the edge of your seat. We are also getting to know our characters well enough that a flick of the eyebrow or subtle smile speaks volumes. Very few of the blanks you carried over get filled in but we do get a sense of how things fit together better. Not through lengthy idiot-proof exposition but by casual references and wonderfully natural dialogue. The only regret you have is that Lepp's 200 page marvels are over far too quickly. This volume contains a Free Comic Book Day story that although stands alone fits neatly and perfectly into the ongoing saga. The highest Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels
9781416934899,"I loved the pleasurable, completely undignified way that the story (or rather... stories) play out in ""The Seven Wonders of Sassafras Springs"". When young Eben's father gives him a challenge to find 7 ""Wonders"" in their dusty little 1923 town of Sassafras Springs, Missouri, Eben isn't so sure that he can really discover that many Wonders. He only has been given 7 days to find these marvels, and he's quite sure that no Great Pyramid of Giza or Hanging Gardens of Babylon will be found in Sassafras Springs. If he successfully completes the challenge, Eben's father has promised him a special trip by train, all the way to Colorado. This would be the biggest thing to ever happen to Eben, a boy who has only been able to dream of traveling. Now his chance has arisen to get out of Missouri, and discover great things... but to do it, he has to explore his own turf further and deeper than he ever knew before. Many of the tales that Eben comes across include some sort of whimsical imagination in order to listen to the old stories that country folks can tell. Some are a bit too far-fetched, but enjoyable. I had almost convinced myself to give this book 3 stars, but then I remembered the simple ways that the author added in a few words here and there about the Lord, singing in church, etc., and I felt satisfied in giving it a 4 star rating instead. This is a cute book, and my younger brother absolutely loves it. I think no better words really describe it than the review given on the front cover, which says: ""A fun, folksy outing."" Truly, that explains ""The Seven Wonders of Sassafras Springs"" perfectly. To leave you now with my favorite quote of the book, coming from the first chapter: ""I'll start tomorrow. I guess Columbus said something like that once, only he said it in Italian.""",Tarissa
9781416935032,"What happens at your grandma's house, stays at your grandma's house, right? Well, that's what Devon Delaney thought when she spent the summer before seventh grade away at her grandmother's. She figured there would be no harm in telling her new summer friend, Lexi, that back home she was popular and dating the coolest guy in school. After all, Lexi lived far away and would never know the truth. Plus, it gave Devon the chance to spend two whole months living out the fantasy of being part of the A-list crowd, calling herself ""Devi"" and wearing lots of cute new clothes. But Devon's real life comes crashing down the following school year when Lexi moves to town unexpectedly. Devon knows she has to come clean and confess to Lexi, but she keeps putting it off. In order to keep Lexi from finding out the truth, Devon has to pretend to be the popular ""Devi"" and make up even more lies to explain why she barely speaks to her gorgeous ""boyfriend,"" Jared. Meanwhile, Devon's real-life best friend, Melissa, is getting fed up with Devon spending all of her time with the new girl, Lexi. Is it possible that Devon is trying so hard to be popular that she'll end up with no friends at all? THE SECRET IDENTITY OF DEVON DELANEY is a fun, fast-paced book. It does a nice job of contrasting the lives and interactions of the ""popular crowd"" at Devon's school with those of the not-so-popular kids. Devon and her best friend, Melissa, are not exactly riding the top rung of the social ladder, and it's amusing to read how Lexi, the new girl, shows up at school and slides seamlessly in with the A-list crew. Devon is stunned by the ease with which her new friend does that. It's something Devon had dreamed of doing, but never knew where to start. I enjoyed this book and was satisfied by the ending, but by about mid-way through the story, I wanted to scream at Devon. She kept burying herself deeper and deeper in lies in order to keep her initial falsehoods concealed. If she had simply admitted to Lexi what had happened in the first place, everything would have been fine. But things just went from bad to worse, with Devon's decisions getting more and more ridiculous as time went on. That was my biggest complaint about the book, although perhaps making the reader scream with frustration was intentional on the author's part. It helps show how even one little lie can spin out of control. Finally, THE SECRET IDENTITY OF DEVON DELANEY seems like it would appeal primarily to girl readers, and the book cover says it's geared to readers ages 9 through 13, which seems about right. I highly recommend it for that audience, especially for readers who enjoy a funny story that reminds us about how important it is to stay true to who we are.",TeensReadToo

9781770492622,"Acquired: Received a review copy from Tundra Books. Reason for Reading: I'm a fan of picture book biographies and Maud Lewis is a favourite Canadian artist of mine. Maud Lewis is a Canadian folk artist from Nova Scotia. She is often known as what is commonly called an ""outsider"" artist as she painted for the pure joy of it, on anything she got her hands on, despite her physical limitations, without any formal training and though she did sell her paintings it was more because the buyers sought her out than she sought to find buyers. This is a lovely little biography with just enough information to give anyone a brief introduction to Maud Lewis' life and artwork. For the majority of the book every right-hand side page includes a photographic reproduction of one of Maud's paintings giving a well rounded look at several of her styles and themes. An entertaining book that could easily cause an older reader to want to explore Maud's work and life in greater length and detail. A great addition to shelves on Canadian artists.",Nicola Mansfield
9780553494648,"MUDSHARK is a great addition to any Gary Paulsen collection. It's not the HATCHET adventure type, but rather one of the crazy, mad-cap mishap stories like HOW ANGEL PETERSON GOT HIS NAME and LAWN BOY. Mudshark is actually Lyle Williams. He got his name for his lightning speed and his incredible observation skills. These are skills he honed while keeping an eye on Kara, Sara, and Tara, his triplet sisters. When they became mobile, life became one accident-avoidance after another. Most of Mudshark's skills are put to use helping his friends at school. He has a certain knack for finding anything that goes missing. The main adventure, in what I hope is Paulsen's first in a series of Mudshark adventures, is locating the school's mysteriously missing erasers. Yes, gradually every eraser in the school has disappeared. The cast of characters in MUDSHARK is quite colorful. There's a talking parrot in the library, an easily excitable English teacher, a culturally educated custodian, and a ""free-range"" gerbil, just to name a few. I especially enjoyed the principal's announcements that opened each chapter. His running commentary on some sort of out-of-control situation in the faculty restroom was a hoot! Aimed at an audience of 8-12 year olds, MUDSHARK is one of those fabulous Paulsen books that can be enjoyed by anyone from a beginning chapter book reader to a senior citizen who remembers what it's like to be a kid. At only 83 pages long, MUDSHARK is a quick way to pass the time and enjoy a laugh or two.",TeensReadToo

The Whipple family is part of a religious group known as the Saints that left Holland to find religious freedom in this far away place. The Mayflower first came ashore off Cape Cod. Women and children were left on the ship while the men explored. It was determined that the area was not their true destination, and they set sail for a neighboring region. The Pilgrims finally settled in a place Remember refers to as Plimoth. At the start of the voyage, Remember's mother gives her a handmade diary and encourages her young daughter to record the events of the journey. What follows is a fascinating account of the treacherous trip across the Atlantic. The sea voyage was extremely uncomfortable and deadly. Many passengers didn't live to set foot in the New World. Remember was one of the lucky few whose entire family survived the journey. Once in the New World, the settlers were faced with even greater challenges. They arrived at the start of winter, so sickness continued to decrease their numbers, and the shortage of food presented further problems. Although Remember writes of being excited to see and meet the Indians, the men of the group prepared to deal with a possible unfriendly welcome from the natives. Author Kathryn Lasky paints an incredible picture of these brave pioneers. She describes the investors who gambled that the pilgrims would make the voyage, create a settlement, and then produce products that would be returned by ship to repay their investment. Lasky turns this well-known story into a suspenseful adventure told by a courageous young girl. A JOURNEY TO THE NEW WORLD is a welcome addition to the DEAR AMERICA series.",TeensReadToo

So then he tried looking in the attic. And instead of a present, Sam discovered an article that would question who he was and if he was even in the right place. He didn't know it, but this was the beginning of a very long journey. Unfortunately, Sam isn't able to read much, so finding someone who could read the article for him was his first obstacle. While his teacher was lecturing on certain spices, Sam took this opportunity to look for someone he could trust to read the article for him. He lands upon Caroline, the new girl who unexpectedly came into his class about a month ago. He knew she was the perfect candidate since she was always reading during class. Of course, he couldn't just go up to her and ask her to read it for him. So he decides to make friends with her.

Then his teacher volunteers Caroline to help Sam with a castle he was going to build. With this, Sam finally has the opportunity to spend more time with Caroline, and maybe even try to become her friend. Hoping that she would be able to help him, Sam still had other things to worry about, like his dreams that contain images of objects that surround him in his daily life.

9781442433076,"Reason for Reading: next (and, I'm guessing, last) in the series. Simple enough plot: Lisa and Nilly figure out that most of Norway has been hypnotized by space aliens whose ultimate goal is to take over the world so they can use humans as food. They alert Dr. Proctor and the three of them, with the aid of several others who have not been hypnotized set out to stop the dastardly aliens before they can invade Denmark and set their world domination plan into action. Hilarious! I read this book in two sittings and enjoyed it probably the most of all three books. There are no references to book 2 at all except for mention of Dr. P's lady friend who is still in France and not a character in this book, so there is no need to have read the books in order. I do recommend at least having read book 1 though as it explains the whole Fart Powder background, while this book just assumes you know the power of the invention. Also, the American publishers make a big deal of the ""fart"" allusions in the title of these books , but except for book 1 there is very little toilet humour within the books at all once you get past the idea of ""fart powder"". The name of this book in Norwegian is ""Doctor Proctor and Armageddon. Maybe."" which is an appropriate title while ""Who Cut the Cheese?"" is simply a marketing gimmick. However ... The story is deliciously funny. Nilly and Lisa are fantastic kid characters, with strange families and even stranger classmates and teachers. We have a few new characters along for the ride this time who add a new dimension to the team but as usual, Nilly and Lisa are the only main kid characters. The plot is way-out there silly and Doctor Proctor as usual has a few fun inventions to help them out. If you've enjoyed the other books in this series, you'll love this one! To me, there is a finality to the book which makes me think this may be the last book in the series. If so, I'm happy to leave the characters here and have enjoyed my time with them. For younger children, I suggest you just read books 1 & 3 and leave book 2 for older children who have some historical knowledge/interest in France.",Nicola Mansfield

As we once again join the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, they are about to be deposited by their banker, Mr Poe, with another distant relative, Aunt Josephine, who lives, fearful on many things in a house precariously perched above Lake Lachrymose. Having already suffered the loss of their parents, the threat of marriage, and the murder of their Uncle Monty at the hands of the evil Count Olaf, the siblings are ever-vigilant of his reappearance. Luckily these well-mannered and uncomplaining children are also very resourceful: Violet invents, Klaus reads and Sunny bites. Snicket's tone throughout is apologetic, sincere and matter-of-fact as he relates the unfortunate events in the children's lives; his imaginative and even surreptitiously educational style will hold much appeal for younger readers. This instalment, cucumber soup, sailing on a lake in a hurricane, hungry leeches with teeth, peppermints and the importance of grammar all have a part in the tale. The alliterative titles are delightful and Brett Helquist provides some wonderfully evocative sketches. What will befall the Baudelaires in The Miserable Mill?",Marianne Vincent

Will the gramatically correct dowager be kind like Uncle Morty, or retched like Count Olaf? It turns out that Aunt Josephine is a mixture of the two. Although she welcomes them into her home, the woman is so terrified by everything--the stove, glass doorknobs, radiators, and even realtors--that the children are hard pressed to enjoy their dinners of cold cucumber soup and their presents of a baby doll, train set, and rattle. Living high above the Lake that is full of the leeches that devoured Josephine's husband, Ike, the three Baudelaire children have a hard time convincing their Aunt to even leave the house. On a trip to the market, however, who should appear once again with yet another despicable plan to steal the Baudelaire fortune but Count Olaf--this time in the disguise of Captain Sham, a man with an eye patch and peg leg who has opened a boating company of his own. Josephine, of course, is at once enamored of the dashing Captain, and Mr. Poe, as always, is not convinced by the children's claim that Captain Sham and Count Olaf are one and the same. What follows is another does of typical Baudelaire fair--diabolical plans, a terrible hurricane named Herman, a bizarre restaurant named the Anxious Clown, a boat ride across a leech-filled lake, a rescue at Curdled Cave, and another meet-up with Count Olaf's nasty associates. THE WIDE WINDOW is another winning story in the tales of the Baudelaire orphans. The story took me about an hour and a half to read, and is suitable for children around ages 9 and up.

Some volumes are better than others, but all rated high with me, either 4 or 5 stars. The story takes turns towards the darkside and is lightened up every now and then with a humorous side story. And all throughout the story, even though it does get mighty dark at times the humour is always there too. My favourite characters were the Red Dragon, Ted the leaf bug, and Bartelby. My favourite of the main characters was Smiley Bone. If you haven't had the pleasure yet, take some time out and read the series as it is a great ride with a satisfying ending.",Nicola Mansfield

9781599902883,"Once upon a time, in a land very far away, there lived a girl with her mother. Every day as the girl grew and played, she also became more and more curious about the world outside. One day she finally climbed up her wall and discovered that she really knew nothing at all. And that was when she decided to do something about it. Think you know Rapunzel? You've never heard it like this! With a feisty heroine who uses her ridiculously long hair as a weapon and a sidekick who travels with a goose that just might lay a golden egg, RAPUNZEL'S REVENGE takes the traditional tale of Rapunzel and turns it on its head. Shannon and Dean Hale create a thoroughly entertaining world in which Rapunzel takes claims her life as her own. Follow along as she embarks on a swashbuckling quest to save the world from the evil witch who has held her captive in a move that sets the bar for adventurous heroines everywhere. Be forewarned: RAPUNZEL'S REVENGE is not for everyone. It is a graphic novel, and while the illustrations are gorgeous and highly amusing, some readers may not be drawn in by the format. However, for those who love graphic novels, fairy tales, and awesome heroines, this story may be just the thing. Happy reading.",TeensReadToo
9780763653842,"Reason for Reading: All my readers should know by now that mythology is a favourite subject of mine, especially Greek. Plus I had also read Williams' first Shakespeare book ages ago when it first came out so knew what to expect. An absolutely beautiful oversized book, graphically designed to be aesthetically pleasing. The author/illustrator often takes a week per single page to design the gorgeous artwork. Each page is rimmed in a thematic border pertinent to that part of the story. The book includes 8 common Greek myths (though one was new to me, or at least far back in my memory banks) and sets them up in comic strip fashion rather than more common comic book/graphic novel format. Each page flows in lines of the comic strip with a written narrative underneath each strip and within the frames bubbles are used to emphasize the story and generally add silly humour to the character's reactions to what is going on around them. While the stories are brief, they tend to stick to the major details of the original myths, the basic plot lines are there and the important themes are kept in play. The violence is there though only shown with a drip of blood here and there and obviously dead bodies; this may be an issue with some parents. I found it all in good taste at this level as long as your goal is not to hide death and violence. The story that may have been new to me as I didn't really recall it was ""Arion and the Dolphin"". The others are very popular: Pandora, Orpheus/Eurydice, Heracles 12 Tasks, Daedalus/Icarus, Medusa, the Minotaur and finally the story of Arachne. A great read, thoroughly hilarious, but keeps the original themes of the myths themselves. Wonderful art and a great way to introduce children to the myths, exciting reading for older reluctant readers and a fun way for adult classicists to see the tales told in a new light.",Nicola Mansfield
9780141340050,"Having been a reader and fan of Chris Bradford's ""Young Samurai"" books, I've been looking forward to reading BODYGUARD: Hostage with a good bit of trepidation. Would the new series deliver? Could a story with such a completely different topic and setting be as convincing and captivating? To keep it simple: Absolutely! Connor Reeves, an average teenager - apart from his high level of martial arts skills perhaps - full of self-doubt and with his fair share of problems, but with a strong sense of what is right, is recruited into a unique organization, that trains young teenagers as Bodyguards. As unbelievable as this premise may sound at first, it rings true in a world of teenage stars and celebrities and ultimately provides a fascinating groundwork for an impressive and captivating storyline, whisking the reader into a world of covert surveillance and teenage meltdowns. The characters excite interest, the action is detailed and feels authentic and the meticulous research on the work of a bodyguard is palpable in almost every page, without becoming too technical to alienate the young reader. And it's not just a book for boys: the host of strong female characters makes this an excellent read for girls as well, as my 12-year-old daughter can confirm. Having just completed his basic training Connor struggles with an array of difficulties on his first assignment: from having to play a role for the girl he's assigned to protect, to not being taken seriously by some of the adult security team, always inserspersed with the constant fear of failing. But he pushes through the problems, backed up by a team of wonderful characters, that will have you picking your favourites after only a few chapters. I'm actually of the opinion this book should be read by every teenager, because apart from the impressive story it teaches kids some well-selected and crucial basic principles of awareness, assessing a situation and ultimately keeping safe. And that is something that Bradford excels at: telling an action-packed yarn that feels authentic, while at the same time teaching the young reader a thing or two and ultimately giving him the chance to grow as a person. BODYGUARD: Hostage is a riveting read, that intrigues the reader in the first few chapters, captivates him with an array of likeable characters and a well-paced plot and ends up speeding along like a bullet train, which will leave dinners go cold and homework undone, till the last pages are turned.",Jan Murphy

9780689817212,"Mrs. Eva Marie Olinski, a paraplegic who returns to teaching after several years following a serious accident, chooses four students from her sixth-grade class in the Epiphany, NY, middle school for the Academic Bowl team. Noah Gershom accidentally becomes best man at the wedding of Ethan's grandmother and Nadia's grandfather while visiting his grandparents in Florida. Nadia Diamondstein, in addition to being the granddaughter of the new wife of Ethan's grandfather, has red hair, a dog named Ginger that's a genius, and a fondness for baby turtles. Ethan Porter, in addition to being the grandson of the new husband of Nadia's grandmother, is the quiet second son of one of Epiphany's oldest families who stands up for Julian. And newcomer Julian Singh, who is originally from India and whose father has opened a bed and breakfast in Epiphany, starts it all off by inviting the others to a tea party. How did Mrs. Olinski choose her team? She had a numb er of answers, but were any of them true? Yet, there is no doubt that these four students, with their own individual personalities, develop a special bond among themselves, calling themselves ""The Souls,"" and this attracts their teacher's attention. Why did they make such a good team? And will they be able to win-especially against seventh and eighth graders? In 1968 E. L. Konigsburg had won both the Newbery Medal for From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and an honor award for Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth. The View from Saturday won the Medal in 1997. The biggest complaint is that the book is boring, at least the first four rather long chapters where the author provides the setting for the action by describing the different backgrounds of the four students as well as Mrs. Olinski, and that therefore it can be somewhat confusing to read, especially with alternating the final quiz bowl championship match with the accounts about the different journeys which each kid has had to make. Some of the reason for this may be that Konigsburg started out with four separate short stories that she had written and then tied them together with a unified theme. One teacher noted that his kids told him that the book started very slowly, mainly because they didn't see the looming connections between the characters, but once the connections become evident, thanks to Konigsburg's marvelous narrative, they thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel. He concluded that the story provides very positive statements about success, hard work, and civility, and I agree. There are a few things about it that I didn't care for. One was a rather gratuitous reference to bra straps and what would be to most kids a somewhat titillating use of the word ""puberty."" Also, one student refers to another as ""an ass,"" which is a perfectly acceptable use of the word, but it's said in such a way as to imply another, more vulgar, usage. And there is a reference to drinking wine. Aside from these, however, I enjoyed reading the book. It is certainly a different approach to story-telling, and I can see why some children would not care for it, but I can also see why others would really like it.",Wayne S. Walker

9780375801532,"A mysterious, fearsome giant, made of iron, walks out of nowhere to the top of a cliff. No one knows where he had come from or how he was made. When he steps off the cliff, he crashes and breaks into a hundred pieces, but over time all the pieces fit themselves back together again. Soon afterwards a farmer's son named Hogarth is fishing in a stream and at evening sees a giant black figure, bigger than a house. No one, except his own father, believes Hogarth at first, but when reports begin to come in about missing tractors, plows, and other farm machinery made of steel and iron, everyone decides that something needs to be done. A big hole is dug near where the Iron Giant had gone back into the sea and is covered with branches, straw, and soil, with an old truck on the nearby hill as bait to trap the monster. At first, he does not come, but eventually he does fall in and is covered with a mound of dirt. However, the following spring, he digs out of the trap and starts eating all the barbed wire for miles around, as well as hinges which he tears off gates, tin cans which he finds in ditches, tractors, cars, and trucks. The farmers talk about calling in the army. But Hogarth has a plan. What is it? And when a giant space lizard the size of Australia comes to Earth from Orion and threatens to destroy the planet by eating all living things, is there anything that Hogarth and the Iron Giant can do to save mankind? We saw the 1999 Warner Brothers animated feature film The Iron Giant, and our boys really liked it, but I didn't know until a few years ago that the movie was based on a book, originally published in England as The Iron Man, although the two are very different in many respects. The book is quite spare, consisting of only five chapters, so it is an easy read for middle grade students. There is one mention of the stars being billions and trillions and zillions of years old, but it is also said that the people wept and prayed to God to save them from the space lizard. No bad language occurs. Author Ted Hughes was poet laureate of England from 1984 until his death in 1998. The book is said to be ""a powerful tribute to peace on earth-and in all the universe,"" so some might see in it a little anti-war propaganda, but the fact is that no reasonable person really wants war and that everyone hopes and strives for peace. There is a sequel, The Iron Woman, describing retribution based on environmental themes related to pollution.",Wayne S. Walker
9780140310764,"Reason for Reading: Read aloud to ds as part of our history curriculum.

Thus the children play and learn together until one day Sister does not return from town and the Nazis arrive at the school looking for the Jewish children. A lovely little story that has become a classic. The ending is quite intense and the book is very enjoyable . There is a religious element to the story, that is crucial to the plot, but that only revolves around one bible story involving King Herod's search for the baby Jesus.

9780374386153,"I'm coming into this review as a blank slate. I don't know anything about 'A Wrinkle in Time' novel. I haven't read the novel and I'm not sure I've heard of it. Zero emotional attachment. I wasn't even sure what to expect. Given all that, I didn't really enjoy the book. The book starts off as any typical coming of age story. A misunderstood teen with more to offer then any of her peers realize. Then things start going off the tracks and this story becomes an interstellar adventure to save the world, maybe the entire universe. Nothing wrong with that, but the characters failed to connect with me. The story is full of characters with all kinds of cute names and personalities that I am sure are meant to register. I got the feeling the novel gave more breath to the characters then the graphic adaption was able to muster. They seemed like the type of characters that could fill a kid's dreams, but the graphic novel couldn't deliver that wonder. It didn't help that the main character came off a bit annoying. Especially towards the end. She kept complaining about the same thing over and over. The art does its job well. The characters are easily recognizable and emotions are clear. There are some times when the figures become a little stiff or feel a little rushed. There are several artistic story telling devices that are used to portray space or emptiness. This is kind of cool, but I feel it's used a bit excessively. There are pages of 'nothing'. The book was a herculean effort and I think fans of the original novel will appreciate this adaptation. However for me, the magic was not included. Book Received: For free from publisher in exchange for an honest review Reviewed by Chris for Book Sake.",Jessica

9781442407695,"Reason for Reading: I am a fan of the author and basically catching up with her books. This was a pleasure to read and a book that every once and a while gave me little ripples of pleasure coursing through me body to read such a fine example of middle grade fantasy. I hate to use this comparison but it highly holds up to the ""Harry Potter"" model. Here there isn't a boarding school as such, but the children (13yos) are sent to live in a large magical building where they attend school learning magic, have strange instructors, are surrounded by large magical creatures and this is their new home. This live-in school atmosphere has traditionally been a successful formula for books aimed at this age group and with the addition of magic it becomes quite beguiling. I simply adored the set-up for this story. It is being described as dystopian in some circles however that I do disagree with, as there is no evidence this is our world, in fact it quite seems to be an alternate world but as in the dystopia fashion an event has happened to change to structure of society leaving it miserable and under the total control of one self-appointed leader. McMann is a wonderful writer and at this point I just don't think I wouldn't enjoy one of her books, even though they do sometimes rate a 4 with me. The characters are engaging and inviting, leading you to connect with them right away. The magic is fun but must be learnt as it is a skill. The leader of the land of magic, Artime, is charismatic but often shows glimpses of sadness leaving the reader with a sense that he has a secret that will eventually come to life. A pleasure to read, though I will say there were some spots where the plot seemed to drag for a while and as much as I enjoyed it I wouldn't call it a page-turning.

9780786856299,"I first heard about this book when I was watching the special features on the movie version of The Lightning Thief. I absolutely loved the movie (and still intend on purchasing it) but didn't realize until afterwards that it was actually based on a book. Of course, after viewing the movie, I instantly wished I had read the book first. Since the movie came out, I've been dying to get my hands on a copy. So of course, when I saw it at Goodwill for only $.50 I had to snatch it up before someone else did. This book is absolutely amazing. Even better than the movie (as most are). Admittedly, it's the first book I've ever read that deals with the Greek gods. Not that the books aren't out there, I just have yet to manage to get my hands on them. Now that I've read this one, I'm even more interested in reading books of the nature. I absolutely loved it. As soon as I began reading I fell in love with the character of Percy Jackson. The things he goes through, magical and non-magical, on a daily basis are amazing and I loved following along as he grew and learned with the rest of us.

Nobody seems to remind that little detail, but he's sure he isn't crazy. But Percy's past is full of secrets, and his mother has tried to protect him until now. Percy's voices trapped me from the beginning. He's young, but extremely fun and mature, and innocent. When he discovers he's a demigod, things starts to get complicated. First, nobody knows who is his father and now he's being accused of stealing Zeus lightning bolt. That's why he, and his friends Grover and Annabeth decides to discovers who is the real thief and that way stop a war between gods. But of course, the Gods have never been very fair and some of them wants Percy to be guilty. Their journey is so much fun.

9781858817637,"Floodland initially gave me the impression of a post-apocolyptic Lord of the Flies style book - a book which greatly impacted me when I read it in highschool and is one that I often consider the implications of and message from to this day. Even small books can make a big impact, so I was optimistic when I started reading this one. But instead of packing a lot of punch in a small number of pages like I hoped, Floodland read more like a cautionary tale. Reasons to Read: 1.A relevant message: Marcus Sedgwick clearly delivers a cautionary tale in Floodland, by suggesting the implications of the future of the environment if our actions are not changed; and while those who are familiar with Lord of the Flies will pick up on a similar theme which is implied by Floodland, it is much more than simply a new spin on the same story. But this is an issue that is so current and modern, that many contemporary readers will easily be able to relate to and it raises poignant questions about our society today. The problem with this though was that it really didn't work in the same way as Lord of the Flies, because it didn't expand enough on this theme and so it lacked the impact. As well, very little background was given and there was next to no room for any development to take place in such a short span of time. So while I read Floodland expecting a short novel, my thoughts by the end were that it reads more as a fable or short story as opposed to a full length book. It does end, however, with a hopeful message and I appreciated that from it. I found this to be the most effective part of the book, as it was successfully portrayed in a meaningful and touching ending. Review copy received from Hachette UK Canada.",Brenna Staats

She puts on her fabulous outfits and gets in her fancy convertible and she gets **** done. I mean, in the first chapter of Secret of the Old Clock alone, Nancy SAVES A CHILD'S LIFE... ...yeah, this book was written originally in 1930, then revamped in 1959, so it is a little tame and predictable, and Nancy has some very Mary Sue-like qualities about her, in that she is basically Perfection Incarnate...Regardless, Nancy Drew is an excellent role model for young girls, because even though she does exhibit all these ideally feminine qualities, she has a brilliant and rational mind and is not afraid to speak her mind when necessary. She has a lot of good sense, and is an overall genuinely nice person... ...This is all made crystal clear in The Secret of the Old Clock; some local New Money jerks, the Topham family, have come into an inheritance from their eccentric relative, Josiah Crowley. The rumor mill is open for business in River Heights about this, because everyone apparently thought Josiah would have left all his money and stuff to his other relatives, who were actually decent people... So of course Nancy goes home and tells her dad all about it, and since he's the Best Lawyer in the World, and so rich he can just pick up pro bono cases to satisfy his daughter's Do-Good whims, they begin work immediately... ...I don't really want to go into detail, since it's such an easy book to figure out, and such a quick read, but I really enjoyed diving back into Nancy Drew, and can't wait to read the rest of the series, especially the books I never got to read when I was younger (there are a lot of them, okay).""

9780448095011,"I find this story written the least well of the Nancy Drew I've read. Nonetheless, it keeps a place of honour as the introduction in 1930, to an everlasting character. Volume 1 is important because manuscript author, Mildred A. Wirt, sketched Nancy's personality and her relationships with family and strangers alike. She is a sharp investigator and morally decent, at age 18. The title is a spoiler. If an event began with a clock and the journey was about deciphering its contents, the existing title would work. However no clock is mentioned throughout the majority of the pages. It is all about not knowing where important information is. We should be guessing for 180 pages, the location of Josiah Crowley's will. Instead: ""The Secret Of The Old Clock"" blares across the cover! Hmmm.... where could it be? We spend the book waiting for a clock to appear. Tracking an obvious object is not as enthralling as it being the actual mystery. Josiah disliked the Topham family, who might inherit his fortune based on an earlier draft. He agreed to live with them in dwindling years, to be polite. However bringing your belongings to a place you dislike is beyond polite. Most of all, how could there have been any draft; not merely including the Tophams but bequeathing 100% to them? One completely omitting the destitute people he loved? He was a shrewd businessman and would ascertain their ulterior motives in asking him to move in. Later, Nancy visited a lake to explore the Topham's cabin; oddly at her rival's recommendation that their caretaker show her around. Instead of telling Helen she had a mission, she wasted two days acquiescing to camp activities. Also noteworthy, thieves infiltrated two houses with people present.

To help him survive, Alvin carries a PDK - a Personal Disaster Kit - which is full of equipment. The most important part of the PDK, though, are the emergency plans, which include plans for meeting your teacher, getting through show-and-tell, and how to make friends. Alvin spends the start of his second grade year trying to survive, figuring out ways to get out of school, and learning how to make friends, all with humorous and sometimes disastrous results. Perfect for readers making the jump to chapter books, this is a fun, laugh-out-loud read. Author Lenore Look and Illustrator LeUyen Pham make a great team. The illustrations add to the emotion of the story and help bring Alvin to life. If you're looking for a younger version of DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, look no further than ALVIN HO: ALLERGIC TO GIRLS, SCHOOL, AND OTHER SCARY THINGS.

9780545386968,"The Infinity Ring series from Scholastic is one of the biggest new ventures unfolding for Middle Grade books. With such a fantastic line up of authors behind these books, I was instantly curious to see how this series would turn out. I'm a bit of a sucker for exciting, epic adventures as part of the Middle Grade genre, and I quickly devoured A Mutiny in Time one morning. It's a great start to a new series, with an exciting pace held throughout the book, likeable characters and a world in danger to set the stakes high. REASONS TO READ: 1. Action-packed from start to finish: I love a good book that can immediately draw me in, and I was amazed at how quickly I was sucked into the story in A Mutiny in Time. It ended up being a VERY fast read, particularly because of just how much action was going on and all the different events taking place. And I definitely have the feeling that this is something that will continue in the upcoming books in the series, as well. 2. A ""save the world"" premise: I have no idea why, but there's something that really appeals to me about having kids and/or teens on a mission to save the world. I'm well aware of how implausible it is, but I just love it - maybe it's the underdog factor, or the idea that amazing things can come from some of the most surprising and unexpected people. I found the world created in this book fascinating because of how familiar it was in most ways, and yet different as it takes place in (what seems to be) the future with some very different past events. Time ninjas?: Admittedly, that sounds crazy - but it works REALLY well and that's basically what we see a lot of. Secret organizations fighting against each other THROUGHOUT TIME on missions to try and prevent the other side from suceeding and altering the present/future. And time travel just always seems to add an extra mysterious, exciting element to a story. And I LOVED the adventures through history, because I'm kind of a history geek myself. A mutiny in Time reminded me of most other Middle Grade books I've read, as they often feature a number of similar elements including anything from globetrotting to misfit geniuses, missing parents, and a serious underestimation of the damage kids can do. So while this book didn't stand out as much as I had HOPED it would, I am definitely interested in seeing how the books progress especially given that each book features a different prominent author. On top of that, there are definitely some plot holes that I definitely felt could have been dealt with instead of being glossed over. Middle Grade shouldn't mean there's a lazy plot; if your characters are geniuses, keep in mind that your readers are intelligent too even if they are younger readers. It's okay to have slightly more complex storylines. However, it is possible that some of my problems will be addressed in later books.

9780545386968,"A Mutiny in Time is a story about 3 kids who travel back in time to fix history before the world ends. I liked the twist in this story that unlike traditional time-travel stories, they are supposed to change things. The historic details that aren't accurate amused me. I think a lot of kids would be clever enough to know whose faces should really be on Mount Rushmore. It would have been fun to see and learn more history (I mean besides the random facts that came out of Dak). The characters and their quirks made me chuckle. One thing I didn't get was why the villain wanted to destroy the world?? Her motivations weren't really clear to me, but I'm hoping that we'll find out more about the bad guys (aka the SQ) and their motivations later on in the series. Wanting power for power's sake does not make interesting villains. Other than that, the author did a good job with playing with your expectations a little with a nice action-filled plot. The story was a lot of fun, adventurous, and didn't feel predictable. Game Review One of the really fun things about this book is the online game component. The book comes with a map that has clues to help with the game. It also had a lot of cool facts from history presented in a nice way. The game was simple, fun, and full of puzzles and mini-missions. I did find the wagon mini-mission to be very finnicky and a little tedious, but I enjoyed the game overall and played it over a few days. Just FYI - the game is an app as well as on the Internet, but they don't sync up. Meaning however far you get on one doesn't transfer over to the other. But otherwise the game is exactly the same whether you play it on your phone or the internet.",Jessica B
9780385751841,"Good young adult and middle grade mysteries are sometimes hard to come by. THE LONDON EYE MYSTERY by Siobhan Dowd is one you won't want to miss. It all starts when Ted's cousin, Salim, comes to visit. Salim and his mother are about to move to New York City and have planned a family visit in London before their departure. Of course, what is a visit to London without a ride on the London Eye? That's when the trouble begins. Ted and his older sister, Kat, haven't seen much of their cousin in the past. The visit starts out on a wrong note because of the unusual sleeping arrangements required by their tiny house. Kat is unhappy about bunking on the couch, and Ted is unhappy with the disruption of his whole routine. As Ted explains, he suffers from a ""syndrome,"" which he defines by stating that his brain runs on ""a different operating system"" than everyone else. His judgment of other people's emotional responses is a bit off, and his views of the world around him tend to be quite literal. (I'm guessing that he suffers from some form of autism.) Salim turns out to be quite a pleasant visitor. His only request is to take a ride on the London Eye, a massive ferris wheel attraction in the center of London. When the cousins and their mothers arrive at the Eye, they find the ticket line and actual ride line disappointingly long. Relief comes when a stranger offers one ticket, free of charge, to Salim. Ted and Kat eagerly accept the ticket and pocket the original ticket money from their mother as they rush Salim to the waiting ride. The mystery begins when Salim doesn't disembark from the London Eye at the conclusion of his ride. Ted and Kat have as many as nine different theories. Was he kidnapped? Did he actually go on the ride at all? How could he have vanished so completely? Quirky characters, London scenery, and a who-dun-it style combine to make this a sure hit. The late Siobhan Dowd, author of A SWIFT PURE CRY, outdid herself once again.",TeensReadToo
9781416905868,"A good, solid story taking place during the Revolutionary War. I think many people overlook the use of slaves during early American times, and ""Chains"" brings out a story you won't soon forget. The author writes a gripping story that reels you in. Isabel is wrongfully sold into slavery, along with her younger sister, Ruth. Coming under bondage by the hand of the unsympathetic Locktons, young Isabel finds herself being bolted into place. Bound by the invisible chains of slavery, she just wants the freedom that was intended to be hers and her sister's. ""Chains"" is an epic tale, which I would gladly read again. But I'll have to read the sequel first. A note to parents: There is some outright defiance and domestic violence portrayed, in a fight between Isabel and her owner. I'm personally not saying this is bad quality in the book, for I truly felt for Isabel in those times, although some families may not care for their children to read scenes like that.",Tarissa
9781416905868,"Laurie Halse Anderson tells the amazing story of a slave girl during the American Revolution. Isabel is actually supposed to be free, since that's what her deceased owner willed, but a greedy nephew takes it upon himself to keep Isabel and her younger sister, Ruth, enslaved for his own profit. With no parents, and no one to care about their fate, the girls are shipped off to New York to live with new owners. Aside from Isabel's plight, this book also follows the progress of the war from the standpoint of both loyalists and rebels. Readers have glimpses of the wealthy, the working class, the soldiers, and the slaves -- all while their eyes are riveted to the story of one lonely girl. Anderson develops a realistic setting and offers up details that serve to enrich this tale and keep readers interested. From a trip to the stocks to a hanging, we see the gruesome, and from heroic acts to cowardice, we see people at their most extreme. Anderson allows enough filtering and distance for comfortable reading, but expect no holds barred from this accurate author. The times were not pretty, despite the burgeoning of a new America.

I felt like the story was way too quick and should have been explained or at least more detailed. I would have rathered it to have been a multi graphic novel series, as opposed to a quick book that left no lasting impression. I don't think the book was that rushed, so there's not really an excuse for them to rush the graphic novel story.

9780439372978,"I think the fact that I had never heard of CHASING VERMEER before I picked up a copy at the bookstore helped in my enjoyment of it. After I finished reading the book, I read with interest other reviews, which is usually my habit after I've written my own review. I like to see what other readers thought of a story, or how similar--or, in some cases, dissimilar--my own thoughts and feelings are from other readers. I was surprised to see that many had touted CHASING VERMEER as a THE DA VINCI CODE for the younger set. I was surprised by the supposed hype that the book had generated. I was surprised, in fact, by the way I was caught up in the story myself. Although I can't comment on it's similarity to THE DA VINCI CODE (I'm one of probably only a handful of humans on the planet who hasn't read it!), I can say that CHASING VERMEER is a mixture of mystery, art, precociousness, and ingenuity that made it a joy to read. Petra Andalee and Calder Pillay live down the street from each other in Hyde Park, share the same birthday, and have as the same sixth-grade teacher, the wonderful Ms. Hussey, at University School. It's rare to find a teacher who allows her students to have a say in what material they will cover, and both Petra and Calder are aware of this. When Ms. Hussey asks the students to discuss with an adult a letter that changed their life, most students are baffled. When the assignment fails, Ms. Hussey instead takes them on a field trip to the Art Institute--where the worlds of Petra, Calder, Ms. Hussey, and Vermeer collide. Who was Vermeer? An artist, it turns out, who has several paintings attributed to him that some members of the general public don't agree were done by the painter himself. Suddenly, Petra and Calder's world is filled with a strange book entitled ""Lo!"", a painting known as ""A Lady Writing,"" an old lady named Mrs. Sharpe, a man who owns a bookstore, a set of twelve pentominoes, a bunch of frogs, and a few bags of blue M&M's. CHASING VERMEER is, quite simply, an art mystery in the style of Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys, but more interesting and complex. This is a delightful read, and I can't wait to read THE WRIGHT 3, the next story in the adventures of Petra and Calder.",TeensReadToo
9780142401095,"THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC by Jane Yolen is required reading at my school, as it is in many middle/junior high schools across the country. I've been meaning to read it for several years but never did, until my son read it this year as an eighth grader. He insisted I read it. How could I resist that? Hannah is celebrating Passover Seder with her family. It's the same thing every year. Grandpa will get all worked up over old photos on TV, shaking his fist, screaming about the numbers on his arm, and Aunt Eva will calm him down as she always does, laying a hand on his arm, leading the same old Jewish prayers as Hannah mumbles along. But this year will be different. Hannah's brother, Aaron, will get to hide the afikoman, Hannah will get to taste real wine, and then she'll get to open the door to symbolically welcome in the prophet Elijah. But when she opened that door, she had no idea just how different this year's celebration would be. Instead of seeing the hallway in front of her as she expected, she sees a man coming her way, crossing a field. Confused, she turns back to her family and instead sees a strange woman, dressed even more strangely, kneading dough on a wooden table. Hannah's confusion grows as she hears herself referred to as Chaya, and discovers that these two people believe themselves to be her Aunt Gitl and Uncle Shmuel. More unbelievably, they talk about her parents' deaths, and that she herself had nearly died, sick for weeks. Feeling like she's in a dream she can't wake up from, she finds herself pulled into wedding festivities, which includes walking to a nearby village for the celebration. There, her dream turns into a nightmare. Hannah is slowly disappearing as Chaya is loaded onto trucks with the other villagers. Then, later, they are prodded like cattle aboard boxed railroad cars with no ventilation, and they travel, standing, for four days and nights without food or bathrooms. What follows is days, weeks, maybe months, in a Jewish concentration camp. Jane Yolen's telling of the Holocaust is chilling. She gathered information from survivors, those heroes who remember so that the atrocities of the past will never happen again. Ms. Yolen writes in her final pages to the reader, ""That heroism - to resist being dehumanized, to simply outlive one's tormentors, to practice the quiet, everyday caring for one's equally tormented neighbors. To witness. To remember. These were the only victories of the camps."" This book is incredibly powerful. The way Ms. Yolen weaves the past and present together forces the reader to make personal connections. She makes the reader think and ask questions. How could society have allowed such a thing to happen? And, more importantly, how can we assure that it will never happen again? I truly hope THE DEVIL'S ARITHMETIC will remain required reading in schools. Each new generation must bear the weight of those lost souls upon their heart. They must believe that such devastating events can, and did, happen. Only in believing and remembering can we move forward to a better society. Thank you, Ms. Yolen, for this riveting and thought-provoking book. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780545135436,"Reason for Reading: A prequel to the series, but the last book published in the series. This was a really hard book to give a rating to. The story is written by Jeff Smith and the cover illustration is by him as well but once one opens up the book all familiarity is gone. The illustrations are by Charles Vess, who has a completely different style than Smith, and the font used is actually a little hard to read. I loved the story but did not like, at all, the illustrations, even though Vess won an award for them. I was not impressed as I started to read because of the change in illustration but as the book progressed the story won me over and I stopped thinking about the artwork, however my rating does reflect my opinion of both the text and illustrations. On to the story, which was as wonderful as I could have expected. Though being a prequel, it was predictable as we already knew the outcome. This tells the story of when Rose and Briar were young princesses together training to become one of the Veni-Yan. It tells how Briar turned evil and how the Lord of the Locusts started his plan to escape his trap, as well as why and how the rat creatures broke their centuries old peace with the humans. An exciting story with lots of action, an insightful look back at Rose's (Gran'ma Ben) background and her early history with Lucius.

Mr. Melendy, a widowed professor of economics, has been hired by the government for a secret, World War II related job, and must go off to Washington. Mona likes the theater. Rush is a musician. Randy is into ballet. And Oliver is fascinated with nature. As summer begins, the children, having moved from their city brownstone the previous fall, venture into their new neighborhood with the intention of helping their country. They end up making new friends, such as the Addison children, Mr. Jasper Titus, and especially Mark Herron, a boy about Rush's age, while collecting scrap metal. Mark is under the care of his abusive adult cousin Oren Meeker, who has some rather unsavory associates. Then Cuffy is called away to care for a sick cousin. Next there is a fire at the Meeker farm, and Oren is missing. Is there anything that the Melendys can do to help? What will happen to Mark? I first became acquainted with the works of Elizabeth Enright through her Newbery Medal winner Thimble Summer, and then her Newbery Honor book Gone-Away Lake, both of which I really enjoyed, so I speedily picked up Then There Were Five at a used book sale. The book is actually the third of the ""Melendy Family Quartet,"" four books about the Melendys. Just a good, old-fashioned, fun read about a loving family and children who use their imagination, it is preceded by The Saturdays and The Four-Story Mistake, and followed by Spiderweb for Two: A Melendy Maze. It has been described as the ""story of a long and glorious summer in the country with the Melendy family."" Aside from one reference to smoking a pipe, the most annoying thing about the book, something that others noticed in their reviews too, is the seemingly inordinate amount of euphemisms ( such as gosh, gee, blamed, golly, heck, darned, confounded, by gum--someone called them ""objectionable slang and replacement-swear words;"" Mr. Melendy even uses the term ""O Lord"" once as an interjection). Otherwise, there is little objectionable. However, this is not just a ""nice story"" about some ""cute kids."" There is real conflict-an abusive guardian, a fire, even a death. However, there is also a lot of good-natured humor, and in the end everything comes out right. In addition, Enright educates her readers as she entertains them. Thanks to Mark's talent for natural history, we learn about the Perseid meteor shower that comes every August and the poisonous amanita mushroom. And the scene with the social worker is priceless, especially to anyone who has ever adopted or tried to adopt children.",Wayne S. Walker

9781444001488,"Even though this book was meant for a younger audience, I enjoyed it. It made me really nostalgic of when I was younger, and I wanted to be a detective. Even though that's no longer my ambition, I could still relate to the main character nonetheless. Reasons to Read: 1.Writing Style: I really liked the way that St John wrote the novel. It flowed really well; nothing was too awkward about it. I also found it was really easy to read for younger audiences, without making it too young sounding. Each character definitely had their own manner of speaking throughout the entire story that made it easy to know who was speaking at different parts. This book dealt with a lot of things like abuse, slavery, gangs, and poverty-causing debt. All of the subjects, I thought, were kind of mature for a book written for ten-year-olds, but it was written in a very tasteful fashion meant for a younger audience. 2.Plot: The whole plot was really good and the ending was really well done. I won't spoil it (it being a mystery book and all) but all of the loose ends were tied. I didn't figure out the mystery before the end of the book, which was really nice because that can be really annoying. All of the clues did actually connect to the mystery. I can't really say much about what the plot is, but it really is an exciting adventure from start to finish. This book did take me a bit to read even though it's only 201 pages. I think the reason for that is because I just haven't really been into reading lately. Besides that, I think it would be a fairly short read. Some of the secondary characters were a bit flat, but I think that if the author had expanded on them it would be longer book that probably most ten-year-olds wouldn't want to read. Other than that, this book was well done. Review copy received from Hachette UK for my honest review; no other compensation received.",Dorian
9781408815908,"If you kidnapped the world's most mischeivous, cunning teenagers and imprisoned them at a secret training academy for supervillains, what would happen? That's the shamelessly ridiculous premise of Mark Walden's H.I.V.E. (which stands for Higher Institute of Villainous Education) and if you can suspend your disbelief far enough, you will find it a rewarding read. The dialogue is witty, the plot twists deft, and the setting inventive, with plenty of knowing nods to the comic books and Bond films which pioneered the supervillain tropes. (The school is built within a volcano and features special classes for henchmen.) Walden has strong feel for cliches, and delights in using them to turn the reader's expectations upside-down. The skinny, dimwitted blonde is revealed to be more devious than any of her fellow students. The cold, katana-wielding Japanese boy turns out to be not an enemy but a friend. But the book's real strength is the protagonist, Otto Malpense, whose back story is exposed in teasing fragments and whose plan to escape from H.I.V.E. is the engine that drives the story at a cracking pace. When my own writing is described as cinematic, I struggle to take it as a compliment, since films tend to be more superficial than books. They lack smells, tastes, themes and thoughts. With its flashy set-pieces and costumes, H.I.V.E. sometimes does feel like a movie rather than a novel. But it's such a good movie that it doesn't matter, so I'd recommend it to anyone who thought Hogwarts lacked gadgetry.",Jack Heath

By virtue of being assigned to team up with them for a class project he finds himself with the bully/bad apple kids and starts joining their group feeling good belonging to this ""cool"" but troublesome clique. They are really only using him though because he is smart and it gives them an in on making it easier to tease the ""good"" kids. So overall this is a story of friendship and a good read for that. The set up is the same as last time though I'd classify it as a graphic novel as there are probably more classic panel/bubble pages than other forms such as: journal entries, homework pages, school posters, school newsletter, class schedules, report cards, etc. It will appeal to ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" fans but is also out to entertain Star Wars fans as well.",Nicola Mansfield

However, a couple of terrible murders happen in the neighborhood, one a little boy, and the other a little girl. Sometimes ""the Egyptians"" feel as if someone is watching them. And then some strange things begin to occur when the children are playing their game. Has ""The Egypt Game"" gone too far? Will something bad happen to them? Who is responsible for the murders? The Egypt Game, which was a Newbery Honor Book in 1968, is not a book that one would choose to accompany a study of ancient Egypt, like The Golden Goblet by Eloise Jarvis McGraw or Shadow Hawk by Andre Norton, but it is a neat story about some children who use their imaginations and have a lot of fun together. I found it interesting that I had just read Hope Was There, in which a girl named Hope was dumped by her mother on her Aunt Addie, and now in this book April is dumped by her mother on her Grandmother Caroline. It is almost as if there was an epidemic in Newbery Honor Books of mothers abandoning their children. Otherwise, there is not much objectionable. A few common euphemisms (heck, gee, darn) occur, and April utters a couple of ""words that Melanie wasn't allowed to say,"" but they are indicated simply by blanks. The children do disobey their parents a few times when they are not supposed to go out but do so to play their game. A belief in the possibility of reincarnation is stated at one point, and the names of some Egyptian idols are found. Parents of small children or children who are especially sensitive and may have bad dreams from seeing or hearing frightening things will want to know that one scene in particular is rather scary and intense, but for most young people it should be no problem. Overall, I felt that it was a worthwhile book.",Wayne S. Walker
9780152022723,"Ten-year-old Portia Blake and her six-year-old brother Foster are riding a train all by themselves on their way to spend their summer vacation with their Uncle Jake, Aunt Hilda, and cousin Julian Jarman. The Blake parents normally go with them, but Mother and Father will be in Europe until August. The Jarmans have recently purchased a house in the country, so Julian and Portia spend their days exploring, while Foster finds a similarly-aged friend in the Jarman's neighbor Davey Gayson to play with. One day the older kids discover an abandoned Victorian resort community next to a bog. It's like a ghost town. They learn that it used to be called Tarrigo Lake, but after the lake dried up, the homes were abandoned and it became known as Gone-Away Lake. They might even be able to use one for a clubhouse, so they decide to keep it a secret just between the two of them, at least for a while. However, as the two explore, they hear a loud, booming voice coming out from one of the houses. It turns out to be a radio, and they learn that the old village has not been completely abandoned. Elderly siblings Mr. Pindar Payton and Mrs. Lionel Alexis (Minnehaha) Cheever have returned and still live there. But who are they? And can they be trusted? I really liked this book. I found it interesting that on one website, out of 76 reader reviews, 61, the vast majority, gave the book five stars, whereas five gave it one star. Those who did not like the book had two complaints. The first was that it has no plot and is too boring. I guess that this doesn't surprise me coming from children, and adults with the attention span of children, who have been raised on half-hour television sitcoms, video games, and the inanity of Harry Potter. The second complaint was that it is ""way too happy,"" that it is just ""nice people enjoying each other's company and having fun,"" that it doesn't have enough problems and conflict. My, my! I guess there must be more of a market for morbid, depressing children's literature than I would have thought. I'll take ""happy"" any day, thank you. The only thing that I don't like about the Scholastic edition that I bought used is the very modern (i.e., 1980-ish) cover illustration. The book won a 1958 Newbery Honor award for author Elizabeth Enright, who already had a Newbery Medal for her 1938 Thimble Summer. Gone-Away Lake is a charming story. I especially appreciate the way that family is portrayed. ""Aunt Hilda was Portia's third favorite woman in the world. First came her mother, naturally, and after that came Miss Hempel, her English teacher"" (p. 22). The only downside is that there is a lot of common euphemisms (gosh, heck, gee, golly, doggone it, confounded, darn, and darnation), and some instances of pipe smoking occur. Most people will not have much of a problem with either of these things, but some parents would probably like to know them ahead of time. In addition to a pleasant plot with its gentle humor, the stories told by Mrs. Cheever and Mr. Payton about the days when the bog was a lake, which are interspersed with the modern-day adventures of Portia and Julian, illustrate how important the past is, even to children. One reviewer called it an ""Odd story"" that ""may seem dated but it has an almost out-of-time quality that makes it accessible to modern readers."" There is a sequel, Return to Gone-Away, published in 1961, in which the Blake family buys and restores a house at Gone-Away.",Wayne S. Walker

With ADHD and dyslexia and a reputation for trouble following him wherever he goes, Percy has learned to not get too attached to any one school, set of friends, or teachers, for that matter. Yancey Academy has been no different, except for two things. His best friend, Grover, and his Latin teacher, Mr. Brunner, seem to really care about him. While on a school field trip, Percy has quite the bad day. He almost drowns Nancy Bobofit, the school bully; gets attacked by Mrs. Dodds, the math teacher; and then gets told by everyone that there never was a teacher named Mrs. Dodds at Yancey academy. Confused and mistrusting of the two he had come to call friends, Percy grows distant and ends up getting kicked out of yet another school. After the last day, Percy and Grover get onto the city bus to go home. While there, Percy sees three old ladies cutting a piece of yarn. Grover freaks out and asks Percy to wait for him while he runs into a store. Percy ignores him and heads home. Through a series of bad choices and a fight with a foul-tempered, monstrous beast, Percy's mom appears to be killed and the two boys end up at Camp Half-Blood. If monsters aren't enough to take in, Percy finds out his father is Poseidon, the god of the sea, and that his uncle, Zeus, is demanding that Percy return the master lightning bolt by Summer Solstice or he'll be destroyed and another World War will begin. His only hopes are Grover and a smart-aleck girl named Annabeth. Can Percy find the master lighting bot and save everyone's skin, or will the gods start a war bigger than anything anyone has seen before? A great graphic novel adaptation of the original THE LIGHTNING THIEF book. The illustrations are wonderful. The novel is fairly true to the original book; the plot remains intact and is, therefore, well-written. The characters are true to their natures and are well-developed.

Through the help of some dear friends & unexpected events, the pair learns about God, the One who takes care of His little lambs in the pasture. Ruth & Philip are good siblings and companions for each other, especially when they share their treasured romps in the woods. Together, they are intrigued & fascinated by every little creature, whether it's in the grass, the trees, or hiding someplace else. It seems to me, as if these children have two main goals. One goal is to attempt to always evade Aunt Margaret's never-ending slew of chores. The other goal is to earn money... so that they can buy their dream camera, and finish their prized, homemade bird book. The most important thing in this story though, is that the best secret of all is found out--and that's the Tanglewoods' Secret. This book had very good morals for children of any age to learn. Older readers might decide to read this book aloud, so that even the young ones can enjoy it too. I loved this story very much.

9780786836543,"He's rude. He's surly. He won't hesitate to tell you when your haircut looks stupid. And in over 5000 years, he's seen some bad haircuts. I'm talking about my favorite djinni, Bartimaeus, back in book two of his young adult fantasy trilogy. THE GOLEM'S EYE is an excellent sequel to the first book in the series, THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND. In the first book, we meet Bartimaeus, an ancient creature of enormous power that can best be described as a type of demon. Unfortunately, he and all of his kind hate the word demon. He classifies himself as a djinni, so we'll just go with that for the purposes of this review. Why annoy anyone who can shoot magical firebolts at you, right? Anyway, Bartimaeus, and other creatures like him, are summoned by human magicians to do their bidding. Needless to say, this forced servitude, or slavery, is not popular with the servants, so they do their best to turn the tables on their human masters whenever possible. Enter Nathaniel, a boy who is in training to become a powerful magician. In book one of the series, he summons Bartimaeus from the netherworld and an involuntary partnership begins. In THE GOLEM'S EYE, young Nathaniel again finds himself in need of the djinni's aid, so he again turns to reluctant Bartimaeus. This time, a revolutionary group is blowing things up in London, which may or may not be related to a series of unusual occurrences that have the police stumped. Nathaniel feels that his career would take off if he can solve these crimes. But the stakes are high because he knows that his career, and possibly his life, are in jeopardy if he fails. A key part of THE GOLEM'S EYE storyline centers on the activities of a London resistance group that is fighting to overthrow the magicians' government. Nathaniel's inability to track down these criminals is part of the reason he needs Bartimaeus's help. Of course, the djinni has little interest in helping magicians maintain their dominance. After all, they're the ones who continually force him and his kind into servitude. This conflict of interest makes for some entertaining scenes and conversations. If you have not read THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND, I strongly recommend you pick that one up before diving into THE GOLEM'S EYE. Technically, you don't have to read the first one, but there is an awful lot of background you will miss if you don't. Plus, it's really fun. Normally I find myself disappointed in sequels. Somehow they never seem to live up the expectations established by the original. But in this case, I was pleasantly surprised. This book is full of excitement, political intrigue, and humor. Bartimaeus is back with all of his cheeky comments, and there are plenty of thrills to go around. Overall, a great book.",TeensReadToo

9780807576748,"Reason for Reading: This is another book from the Random Bookshelf that I am reading from this year.The Boxcar Children have played a big part in my and my children's lives. I intend to acquire a complete set of the first 19 books (the others hold no interest to me) and keep them as keepers on my juvenile shelves for my future grandchildren. Book 2 is very similar to that of the first in the series. First of all, there is no real mystery except for the hidden identity of a man on the island known only to them as ""Joe"". However, the fisherman who lives on the island knows who he really is and tells the Dr., though swears him to secrecy. The children continuously suspect Joe of being more than just a handyman and wonder who he really is. The story itself is adorable and brings back the children surviving on their own as Grandfather owns a small island where he has decided to let the children stay for the duration of the summer holidays. They, of course, are excited as it brings back their boxcar days and they get right to fixing up the barn as a summer home and cooking, mending and fixing for themselves. A quaint story with no antagonists but simply an innocent tale of childhood from the days of yesteryear. Kids today will get a big kick out of the children being able to live on an island all by themselves for the summer. The resolution is fun and should add another character to the series in the following volumes. Mary Gehr's line & ink drawings are typical of the era and lovingly match the text. An enjoyable, wholesome story for both boys and girls.",Nicola Mansfield
9780448095028,"I've read a few Nancy Drew stories since I was 9, to know others are better than ""The Secret Of The Old Clock"". With the pioneering volume watered down to action scenes and sentences made dull for small children; the superior quality of volume two is impressive. ""The Hidden Staircase"", 1930, demonstrates how a mystery should be done! Diving into the crux is a continuous trademark but there are no irrelevant mishaps to engineer excitement. Every event pertains to the two well-plotted threads and this time, colour is put into the settings and characters along the way. You feel a full-dimensional journey unfold, instead of a stilted jerk from cliff-hanger to cliff-hanger. Helen's aunt and Great-Grandmother consult Nancy about a theft and unexplained occurrences in their locked mansion. Simultaneously, her Dad Carson is threatened by a neighbourhood bitterly selling their properties to a railroad. These are two reasonably serious circumstances for a teenager to take on at once and she muddles through both in a manner that feels realistic; with candour about how stressed out she is. There are no farfetched leaps to solutions, no secret halls are located with any ease, and Nancy isn't thrown into closets or cellars to create a fright factor like in other novels. Hands down, this is the best Nancy Drew I have ever read. Ranking could only be higher if the story were truly paranormal! The reader knows from the start that the girls don't believe a haunting has taken place but dub the intrusion 'the ghost' in good fun. The absence of an actual spectre is what children of the 1970s call 'a Scooby Doo outcome'. On the subject of literary richness, rare for this series: Mildred A. Wirt's description of Nancy's view from the manor roof is an unexpectedly lovely passage.",C. Riedel
9780385737760,"Lois Lowry, winner of two Newbery medals, is not only one of the most beloved modern authors of children's fiction, but also one of the most versatile. She's done comedy (the ANASTASIA KRUPNIK series), drama (A DUMMER TO DIE), historical fiction (NUMBER THE STARS), and even dystopian fantasy (THE GIVER). In her latest book, THE WILLOUGHBYS, she proves her mastery at yet another genre: parody. The object of parody here is old-fashioned children's books. Accordingly, the titular Willoughbys are ""an old-fashioned family,"" and constantly refer to themselves as such. The Willoughby children are Timothy, the bossy oldest child; indistinguishable twins who are both named Barnaby (referred to as ""A"" and ""B""); and the overlooked youngest child, Jane. ""Shouldn't we be orphans?"" Timothy asks one day. While they're not, Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby, unbeknownst to them, are about to abandon their children in a plot inspired by HANSEL AND GRETEL. But the Willoughby children are too busy doing all the things that an old-fashioned family should do to care very much. All the elements of old-fashioned children's literature are included in the plot. Abandoned baby in a basket? Check. Mysterious nanny? Check. Reclusive tycoon living in squalor? Check. Really bad fake German? Well - that might be a new one. It's impressive how effectively Lowry pokes fun at literary cliches so widespread that most of us have never even thought about them. It had never occurred to me how prevalent some of the elements of classic children's literature are until I read THE WILLOUGHBYS, but once it did, I wondered why I'd never read a similar parody. Lowry gets plenty of jokes in while still keeping the plot moving, and the result is a fast, funny read. Adding to the fun are the glossary and bibliography at the end of the book. Here's a sample glossary entry: ""Tycoon means somebody who has amassed great wealth and power in business. Usually a tycoon is a man, for some reason. Maybe Oprah Winfrey is a tycooness."" The bibliography consists of a list of ""books of the past that are heavy on piteous but appealing orphans, ill-tempered and stingy relatives, magnanimous benefactors, and transformations wrought by winsome children,"" which include MARY POPPINS, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES, and the BOBBSEY TWINS series. While teens and adults will also find this book hilarious, it's appropriate for even those younger readers in elementary school. Readers will laugh out loud - and they might even be moved to pick up one of the books that inspired it.",TeensReadToo
9781416970798,"Megan, Cassidy, Emma, and Jess are as different as four preteen girls can be. Yet, their mothers are friends and have invented a mother-daughter book club to spend more ""quality time"" with the girls. The book that they have chosen- LITTLE WOMEN by Louisa May Alcott. Emma, whose mother was the brains behind the book club, has already read this book and many others. As an aspiring writer she reads any book she can get her hands on. It also helps that her mother just happens to be a librarian. The book club is the last place that Megan wants to be. She would rather be at the mall with her friends, taking notes for outfits she would like to design one day. Her mother, on the other hand, has great dreams in mind for Megan. Dreams that involve science and math camp and Harvard. Megan hates that. Cassidy would rather be out playing hockey then spending time in a book club. She is proud of her tomboy status but her mother, an ex-model, is less than thrilled. Cassidy knows that this book club is just another way to try to make her more girly and she hates it. Jess is best friends with Emma and has fun with her in the book club. The only problem is that her own mother has temporarily moved to New York to be a soap opera star. This means that Jess usually has to go to these book club meetings alone -- or worse, with her dad. At the beginning of this book none of the girls are into the book club and would all rather be doing something else. However, with a little help from Louisa May Alcott and a few other interesting events, the girls really come to love it. This book was really, really good.

Cleo is a fun, take life-by-the-reigns character and so far outshines her supporting side-kick friends. The book uses the device of starting with the climax at a crucial point, then going back to the beginning to tell the story of how the characters got there and what happens next. I enjoy this device when done right, and here it keeps the action moving along at a quick pace as the reader sees the events unroll which lead up to this exciting moment.

9780152057800,"TANGERINE is a surreal novel strong in pacing and character development. From the opening page to the very end, Edward Bloor takes the reader on a breakneck course through one family's conflict with the past and its devastating impact on the present. Paul Fisher's nightmare experiences in the shadow of his older brother come to a climax after the family moves from Houston to Tangerine, Florida, a fallen Eden of sorts. He narrates his experiences in the new community with intensity and passion regarding the problems they face. A tension remains until the very end. Paul is an outsider from the very beginning. He is the younger brother of teen football legend, Erik Fisher. Their father dotes on Erik, living out his own frustrated athletic dreams in a sad, pathetic manner. Their mother endures their father, holding the family together with equal parts denial, busy-ness, and critical intensity. She is hyper-involved in all of the family's business, a contrast to her husband, who is focused solely on Erik's success on the field. Both deliberately turn a blind eye to Erik's moral failings, which include a propensity for violence and a complete lack of empathy for others. He is a textbook sociopath and the world merely a gaggle of potential victims. Bloor guides the reader through the novel's 300-plus pages building upon each character with incident upon incident that reveals their true nature and failings. Paul and his parents are forced to face their own cowardice and complicity at several key junctures of the story, particularly during the break-ins and the events that led to the death of Luis Cruz. Facing their failings leaves them broken, but broken for potential rebirth as a better family unit. The novel's message builds upon itself through the evolution of each character: burying a wrong under a bushel of denial takes a terrible toll. Highly recommended.",TeensReadToo

Although ""Flora and Ulysses"" is outwardly charming, for some reason I just didn't ""connect"" with this book. I think I was just looking for more ""meat and bones"" to the story than what I received from it... especially coming from a talented storyteller such as Kate DiCamillo. However, the story boldly steps into more of a comic book style of writing (which is definitely different and adventurous for an author to attempt -- making an interesting outcome). There were a few things I either disliked or think that some parents may disapprove of... Flora Belle, the main character, calls herself a cynic (as does her mom) and thinks that because she is a cynic, she doesn't have to care about her actions when she doesn't feel like it. Flora Belle doesn't maintain a great relationship with her mom, and doesn't always get to see her dad because of the parents' divorce. Also, Flora Belle's mother smokes cigarettes -- something many parents I know would see as a con in a book. In all, the book is a sugar-coated tale of a superhero squirrel and his human cynic friend.

9780440413288,"It is 1936, in the midst of the Great Depression, and ten-year-old Bud Caldwell lives in Flint, MI. His mother, who always said that his name is Bud, not Buddy, never told him anything about his father, but she kept a bunch of fliers about a musician and band-leader named Herman E. Calloway of Grand Rapids, MI, and Bud fantasizes that Calloway must be his father. Unfortunately, Bud's mother died four years earlier, and Bud has been in and out of the orphanage and various foster homes, the latest being the Amoses. Then when Todd Amos beats him up and Mrs. Amos decides to send him back to the orphanage for defending himself, Bud decides to run away to Grand Rapids to find his father. Will he make it? And what will he find if he gets there? Author Christopher Paul Curtis, who had received a Newbery honor in 1996 for The Watsons Go to Birmingham: 1963 and later gained another in 2007 for Elijah of Buxton, said that while Bud, Not Buddy, which won the Newbery Medal in 2000, is fictional, many of the situations which Bud encounters are based on events which occurred during the 1930s and a couple of the characters are drawn from real people. Thus, the reader will learn about life for African-Americans in the Great Depression, including Hoovervilles, hobos, racism, the KKK, and jazz music. The book certainly has a charm about it and finds its way to a happy ending. However, there are some questionable aspects to the story which need at least to be noted. Though it is never mentioned out in the open, there is a constant underlying suggestion that Bud is an illegitimate child. And some people may not care for the pencil-up-the-nose and the shotgun-fantasy scenes. Also there are a few language issues. In addition to some common euphemisms and childish slang (dang, darn, gee, and pee), Bud says ""doggoned"" a lot-and I mean A LOT!-as well as ""kiss my wrist"" several times. And others use such ""polite"" profane interjections as sweet baby Jesus, Lord knows, for God's sake, my Lord, by God, and Lord have mercy. But most troubling is the fact that deception is accepted as a means of survival with little consequence. In other words, Bud lies-again, A LOT! In fact, throughout the book are found several of ""Bud Caldwell's Rules and Things for Having a Funner Life and Making a Better Liar Out of Yourself."" Some of these are funny and harmless, but rule number 3 is ""If you got to tell a lie, make sure it's simple and easy to remember."" One might argue that Bud doesn't have parents to reinforce right from wrong, but many parents will cringe at a book which appears to endorse lying. As one friend noted, ""I'm sure leaving that controversial content in helped it win the coveted Newbery Award."" So caution is recommended, and those who parent from a Biblical worldview will want to pre-read the book and discuss the objectionable elements with their children. For these reasons, I would not suggest it for anyone younger than ages twelve and up.",Wayne S. Walker

She and her best friend, Sal, spend most of their time together, navigating the ins and outs of life, school, and their neighborhood. One day when walking home from school, Sal gets punched in the stomach by an older boy who hangs out down the street from their apartment building. Sal pulls away from Miranda after that and stops hanging out with her. Miranda feels completely lost without him. Since Miranda isn't spending much time with Sal anymore, she has plenty of time to help her mother prepare for an appearance on The $20,000 Pyramid.

There was so much beauty in it that I couldn't help but fall in love with it and feel sorrow at the same time. While I did not feel as strongly for Rebecca Stead's When You Reach Me, I do think it is a beautifully written book and, even better, will inspire children to pick up A Wrinkle in Time if they haven't already. If they have, I think they will feel the urge, like I do, to pick it up and reacquaint myself with the story. There are lots of reviews out there on this book. The majority of them are favorable and I agree with them. I found Miranda to be an interesting character, her friends to be fun and full of mystery (in the case of Sal), the events to be well thought out and everything.. from a 1970's game show to the issue of the homeless on the street came together to form a delightful, wistful, nostalgic story and one that I will pass on to my nieces and nephews ... along with their own copy of L'Engle's book to be worn and torn just like Miranda's was.",Lydia Presley
9780385737425,"Reason for Reading: I'm working my way through reviewing all the Newbery winners. Miranda has been best friends with Sal since they were in diapers, but one day Sal gets punched walking home from school and their friendship ends. Miranda starts running into the boy who punched him, Marcus, and they become acquaintances. Miranda loves the book A Wrinkle in Time and reads it over and over and over. Nobody can get her to try a different book and Marcus starts talking to her about the science behind the time-space travel component of the book. On Miranda's block there is a strange homeless man who talks about strange things, yells things out, talks to her, calls her ""smart girl"" and every now and then kicks his leg out into the street. He also sleeps with his head wedged under a mailbox. Oh, and Miranda also receives strange messages from an unknown person asking her to do things but most specifically to write the sender a letter. It isn't until the end of the book that all these elements come together and make perfect sense to Miranda. An enjoyable book. The science fiction element is light and comes into play towards the end to explain all the strange events. The book also explores friendships as Miranda has relationships with a boy she's known from being a baby, a bully, a friendly neighbourhood woman, a crotchety old man, a girl who is made fun of at school, and a girl who has been dumped by the snooty popular girl, as well as the snooty girl herself. All of these people at some point Miranda befriends and she learns a lot about how appearances can be deceiving and to get to know the inside person before making judgments. Though sometimes a person's true self can a disappointment. I thought the story was well-written, the characters likable and interesting. I read the book quickly and thought the ending was clever. The story never went past good, fine or ok with me though. From a Newbery winner I expect more.",Nicola Mansfield
9780786838684,"He's back! But this time around, the smart-mouthed djinni, Bartimaeus, is exhausted from too much work and not enough time to recover in his netherworld home. It's like they always say, ""All work and no play makes Bartimaeus a dull supernatural being."" Although, in this case, he's anything but dull. He's tired, weak, sharp-tongued, homicidal, and insulting. But definitely not dull. In this third installment of THE BARTIMAEUS TRILOGY, the hero is again a djinni who has little respect for humans and even less interest in their petty wars and government squabbles. The magicians who rule England in this series of books insist on summoning Bartimaeus and scores of other demons to fight their wars, provide magical assistance of all sorts, and generally do their bidding. The demons see this treatment as slavery, and for good reason. What would you call forced servitude for no pay under threat of intense pain? PTOLEMY'S GATE opens to find poor Bartimaeus stretched to the breaking point by his magician master, Nathaniel. A war in America is going poorly, the commoners of London are growing tired of the ruling class of magicians, and young Nathaniel is looked upon with jealousy and mistrust by his co-workers. As a result of all of these threats, Nathaniel rationalizes the need to keep Bartimaeus around to help him deal with the many problems that he faces. After a long association with the djinni, it is almost as if Nathaniel trusts his reluctant servant. And it is almost as if Bartimaeus has a shred of concern for human dealings. Almost. PTOLEMY'S GATE is an excellent capstone to the extraordinary Bartimaeus series. I enjoyed all of these books immensely and recommend them to anyone who enjoys young adult fantasy. Like the first two books, THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND and THE GOLEM'S EYE, this one is filled with humor and excitement. These books also offer some social commentary for those who want to pay attention to such things. For example, the ruling class of magicians in these books take extreme measures to maintain their own positions, while claiming that they are really just interested in keeping the masses safe. There are resistance groups that oppose the government, and they engage in acts of terrorism to free themselves from the magicians' oppressive yoke. The entiretrilogy is a fun-filled pleasure to read. Doubtless it would be possible to read PTOLEMY'S GATE without having read the previous two books, but I would not recommend it. There is quite a bit of background that would be missed, and the story would definitely suffer. While the first book in the series, THE AMULET OF SAMARKAND, could probably stand alone, the second two (THE GOLEM'S EYE and PTOLEMY'S GATE) should be read together. And once the last page of PTOLEMY'S GATE is turned, readers will undoubtedly wish they could summon Bartimaeus back for more.",TeensReadToo

9780224606325,"Swallowdale was the first Swallows and Amazons book I read as a child, and it remains my favourite from the series, despite the fact that the sailing is all over and done with in the first few chapters, when a momentary mistake by John threatens to ruin the entire summer. The book, however, belongs to Titty. I have always thought that Nancy stole the show in the first book, but in this one it is Titty's imagination which produces the summer's adventures. She discovers Swallowdale, and in it Peter Duck's Cave, and seems to have a key role in virtually every one of the adventures which make up the story. Roger begins to come into his own as a character. Susan, unfortunately, remains as bland and practical as ever. There are two beautiful links between the Swallows and Amazons of the 1930s and their parents three decades earlier: Captain Flint, as a youth, had climbed Kachenjunga, then named the Matterhorn, and had left a message; and Peter Duck's Cave had once belonged to Benn Gunn. Timeless, beautiful reminders of the joy of youth. And an adventure book for young people which still stacks up beautifully 75 years after it was written (with the obvious exception of Titty's name, which regrettably has not aged well!). Any child who has not yet met the Swallows and Amazons is somehow missing out.",Anthony Marinac
9780786849079,"It's always interesting, at least to me, to read a book that is the retelling of a beloved childhood tale. Whether it be a retold fairy tale such as SNOW WHITE or SLEEPING BEAUTY, or a classic such as PETER PAN, these new spins on old stories usually fall into one of two categories--terribly bad remakes, or truly amazing, imaginative stories with new twists. Thankfully, authors Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson have turned PETER AND THE STARCATCHERS into the latter. In this rendering, Peter is an orphan about the ship Never Land. He's become the leader of sorts to the other young orphans who have been sold into slavery to King Zarboff the Third, evil ruler of Rundoon. Not long after Peter and his boys board the boat, he meets Molly Aster. The fourteen-year old daughter of the new Ambassador of Rundoon is unlike any other girl Peter has ever met. Actually, the only other girl he remembers seeing in a very long time was the daughter of the Headmaster of St. Norbert's Home for Wayward Boys. Peter's increasing infatuation with Molly is challenged when she lets him in on a secret--she is an apprentice Starcatcher, one who guards the magical starstuff from the Others who would use it to do harm. Starstuff is magic that, when it falls to Earth, it brings about increased intelligence, happiness, and even the ability to fly. Although Peter is, at first, quite skeptical of Molly and her Starcatcher business, he soon learns that she's being nothing but truthful. Add to the story the dreaded Pirate Black Stache and the evil pirate crew of the ship the Sea Devil, and you have an interesting story. Throw in the a shipwreck, a missing cargo of starstuff, mermaids, a flying crocodile, and island dwellers that just may be cannibals, and the story goes from interesting to amazing. This is a remarkable retelling, or possibly even a prequel, to the well known story of PETER PAN. Kudos to both Mr. Barry and Mr. Pearson for a highly entertaining and thoroughly engrossing read!",TeensReadToo

9781853261589,"I read ""The Little Prince"", 1943 by Antoine De Saint-ExupA?AE?A?Â©ï¸ry so young, I only recalled the famous cover. I know it is an everlasting classic and expected to enjoy re-learning it. I'm mystified by how engrossed I became from the first sentence. It is positive, rife with bright emotion but all at once engaging, quirky, and clear. It equally manages to make sense for modern day life. Some call this a book of metaphors but I disagree. A writer has influences, a message to impart, and connections can surely be made to other things. That doesn't mean symbols were contrived for readers to guess. This is one novel that is if nothing else, direct: like The Little Prince was portrayed. Friends of mine might woefully find similarities in me, who never speaks rhetorically but seeks a reply! This is a almost a fairytale, urging us to see stars laughing. Instead of probing double-entendres, I accepted the world's parameters as presented: a string of sole-occupant planets with space for a house or a desk. Fiction often incorporates facts and thus a child learns how asteroids are named and that the size of worlds varies greatly. The futility of alcoholism is broached differently from cautionary videos, in a gentle manner that is effective. Because the pilot and prince chat about human basics, everyone gets something out of this; like creativity not being less important than mathematics. The most profoundly struck chord, describes people in my life who discuss finances and training, instead of hopes and what it is that makes you, YOU. Other than the snake portion, turning these pages was an uplifting respite. That Antoine perished in a plane too soon after publication to see his book's effects, is as lamentable as no longer receiving his tender literary and illustrative gifts.",C. Riedel

9781471403989,"Exceptional. Hauntingly beautiful. We Were Liars is a gripping tale of family, love, friendship and protecting those which are most important. This is one story that will stay with you for a long time. I couldn't put it down. I was hooked into the story of this beautiful but not-so-beautiful American family of Sinclairs. I loved the clever way it was written. I am aware that some people were not fans of the writing style and found them confusing and annoying. But personally, I think it's unique and different in a good way. It gave a spontaneous and lyrical feel to the book. I liked the mystery surrounding the Sinclairs. They may seem like a typical wealthy family on the outside but underneath that facade are layers and layers of secrets and lies and pretense and anger that motivated the other family members - the Liars - to take action and try to change things on their own. Speaking of the Liars, I liked their different and colorful personalities. But what I liked most about them is their friendship and love for each other. The cousins Cady, Johnnny and Mirren could have been easily caught on the family politics and turned on each other for personal gains but no. They remained loyal to each other. Even Gat, who was considered an outsider by the adult Sinclairs, helped and stayed with them. And they stayed with him, too. That, for me, was a beautiful friendship that even tragedy could never destroy. I'm not going to lie. I sort of guessed the truth about the three Liars even before the big reveal. But it did not lessen the impact. It broke my heart and left me dumbfounded. I was a puddle of tears by the time I finished reading We Were Liars. The ending was kinda vague and I would have wanted to know more about what happened to Cady. But I think it fit the vague and mysterious way the whole thing was written.

9781442408937,"This is one of the most beautifully written contemporary coming-of-age stories I've ever read. This is a love story at its core, but it's not a traditional love story. It's a love story about learning to love and accept yourself, your family, your friends, and your heart. The book is from Ari's first-person narrative, which I really liked. He's brutally honest about some things, but will shy away from the truths of other thinks, like most people do when the truth is too much to confront at the time. Through Ari's voice, the reader also gets to know and understand Dante, the one person that Ari doesn't really understand but whom he's fascinated by. I fell in love with Ari and Dante as characters. I really enjoyed both sets of parents in this book as well. In a lot of YA books, the story doesn't become too involved with the parents, which tends to keep them sort of two dimensional. But not this book. For the most part, when Ari and Dante aren't spending their time together, they're spending it with their parents. The parents add so much to this story. They each have distinct voices, thoughts, problems, and story arcs. What makes this book stand out the most, however, is the writing. It's utterly perfect. It's poetic, lyrical, philosophical, and totally captures the essence of these two boys. Although the writing is simple and the chapters tend to be short, there's a lyrical quality to it. The pacing is relatively slow. Not much happens in the story. There's not really even a plot in this book. These two boys are just coming into themselves in their own time. It's a character driven story about love, friendship, family, and their Latino culture. The ending is perfect. The way this story comes to a close is just the cherry on top of a wonderful book. There were tears of happiness and a wonderful grin plastered across my face during those last few pages. Everything about this story is incredible. I couldn't put the book down (and clearly judging by this review, I simply loved it). Anyone and everyone that enjoys YA contemporaries should definitely check out this book. The story focuses on two Latino families and dapples in the GLTB genre, so readers outside of the YA contemporary, that might be your in too. But really, just go pick up this book, everyone and anyone. I promise you'll enjoy it!",Ryann Dannelly

9781594746031,"First of all, I went into this book with a very different idea of what this book was going to be about. This is my fault because I didn't realize I'd never actually read a summary of the book. I'd heard so much about it, everything about the pictures of course, and thought I knew what to expect. In my mind this book was a creepy, sort of horror book that was set in the past. This resulted in me being a little confused for the first couple of pages because the books starts out in modern Florida. Something that has to be said about this book is that the design is beautiful. I own the paperback version and it's such a sturdy book. The paper feels a lot nicer and is less likely to rip than that of most other books I own. The cover fits the book perfectly and gives it the creepy vibes that attracted me to this book in the first place. Then the book is filled with antique pictures that sometimes give you an image of what a character looks like, and sometimes are just plain creepy. There's a lot of different characters in this novel. From Jacob's best, and only, friend who has green hair to his snobby mother to a kid who is invisible. Jacob himself comes over like a real person and react to the situations in a way that's reasonable and realistic. My favorite characters were definitely the peculiar children because of how they really acted like children. They asked lots of question when they weren't supposed to and used their abilities in ways that weren't always responsible. Sadly we didn't get to know most of them that well so I hope we'll learn more about them in the sequel. Although the main focus of this book is definitely on the plot and the setting it did make me think. These kids are in a loop where they repeat the same day over and over again. Jacob has to decide whether or not he wants to stay. It made me think what I would do in his position. Would I be able to handle going through the same day in the same place again and again, even if I would be happy there? There were two things I didn't really like about the book. The first one isn't that important, but the chapters are huge. There's 352 pages and only 11 chapters. This way I can't be like: ""I'll just read one chapter before doing this or that"". The other thing that made me feel a little awkward was the beginning romance between Jacob and Emma. Everything is all fine until you remember that Emma used to be the girlfriend of Jacob's grandfather... I am pretty sure this book classifies as young adult but to me it felt a lot more like a middle grade book. There's nothing wrong with that because there are tons of middle grade books I love, but if you don't like those kind of books these may not be for you. Because apart from some gruesomely described scenes I don't think there's anything in the book that I would say is too mature for younger readers. All in all I really enjoyed this book and am really curious about what will happen to Jacob and his friends in Hollow City. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars and would definitely recommend it. Even if it's just to find out what everyone's been talking about. Side note: I found a reference to John Green's papertowns. ""Left at the multiethnic roof Santas!"" (page 32)",Nina
9781594746031,"When I first went to a bookstore and saw this, I think I stood in front of the book screaming at it, not because I was scared of it, but because I was so happy to see it and it felt like I saw a thing of beauty. The lady at the counter shushed me, so I slid at a corner, but glanced at the copy again and screamed again, and yeah, they kinda wanted to throw me out. Anyway, after quick deliberations, I bought the book and I do not regret anything about it ever since! The photographs used are hauntingly fascinating and you keep on staring at them to get a feel of them, intertwine them fully with the character, and you'd realize how intrigued you are by the characters and eventually intrigued by the real people in the photographs. It's amazing how the photos have so much relevance to a particular scene in the story. You'd think that the book can't avhieve the same type of charm as it did with the photos in it. Ransom is a genius. It takes a lot of great effort to find the right photographs for this story so it would seem. Especially with the wide array of characters, finding the right one to fit their peculiarity, is a task on its own and Ransom was able to deliver by giving us wonderful characters like the beautiful, hot-head Emma, to the charmingly optimistic Olive. The main character Jacob, may have become one of my favorite male protagonist. He's honest, very brave and would never think twice in order to help his friends when they're in danger and his curiousity is a charm. You'd think that you'd be swamped with the number of characters involved in the book, but no! You'd actually look forward to them, and that's what's so beautiful about it. Not only that, Ransom made sure that no one is forgotten. Each character has this specific role that plays well in the situation. No matter how many they were in the picture, they mattered. One other thing about this novel is the play on the past and present; fantasy and reality. Ransom was able to bring us the merge of the present life, with the standstill of the past in the Miss Peregrine's loop. Of course, the fantasy element of the peculiarities of the children, like Enoch's way of bringing the dead back to life for a matter of minutes, or Horace's premonition of the future. Since the past they are living in is set in the time of the Nazi Regime, there are some sort of military references along the way, but still minimal. What is amazing is the peculiar language and the antagonists of the story, the wights and the hollows. Ransom was able to make these horrifying creatures that could possibly haunt you endlessly in your dreams if you think about them too much. And then there are the wights. All too cunning and mischievous, I hate them. Style-wise, Ransom's way of writing isn't at all shocking and is easy on the eyes. You won't exactly need to burn a hundred brain cells to understand. It is comprehensible enough for any young reader or teenager out there! Of course, the terminologies may throw you off sometimes, but there aren't a lot so, you'll be fine. What's amazing is that Ransom was able to embrace the British slang quite well and use it to further make the people of Cairnholm, realistic to the readers. Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children is a spice of eccentric you need on your bookshelves.",Writer For Misfits

This day triggers Jacob to go on a trip to the island of of Wales, an island that holds his grandfathers past and may hold Jacobs future. When beginning this book i was excited as i had read and watched so many reviews that raved how great it was and how they cannot wait for the sequel, well i do not share that opinion. For all the hype it received, it left me stunned as the story was average at best. it didnt draw me in nor did it keep me hooked like a great story does. I found the storyline mostly uneventful, the ending didnt have the wow that i expected it was all rather plain and weird to say the least. This book was nothing of what i expected and is certainly not one i would recommend, I will not be continuing the series as it holds no interest for me and i do feel let down by it as i think it was way over hyped. I hope this review has helped you, can you please rate it positively if you liked it as it really means a lot to me, Many Thanks for reading:)",Sarah Martin

9780141345659,"First of all, I am not a Young Adult reader, this books was the first YA novel I ever read. I decided to buy it because every time I scrolled on my Tumblr dashboard, they always were a thousand of pictures of this beautiful blue cover. So, when I started my internship in a bookstore (in february) and saw on the first day, that they had it, I decided to give this book a try and bought it, in English. I didn't want to read it in my mother tongue, French, because I was a bit afraid of the translation since it's a YA novel (also I enjoy reading in English and knew that the writing wouldn't be too hard to understand). So, I start reading it the same day and really enjoyed it at the first sentences. I didn't know about John Green before this book (such a shame, I know), his reputation is firmly established, but I discovered him with The Fault in our Stars and find that his writing is very agreeable to read, flowing freely. I get attached to Hazel, the narrator, very fast and I don't remember being annoyed even one time by reading this book. One night I stayed up late because I REALLY wanted to finish it, I wanted to know what will happen to Hazel and Augustus-the protagonists, so bad... and yes people, I cried.... I now really, really want to read others John Green's novel and hope I will enjoy them as much as I enjoyed this one! So yes, I hardly recommend this book (like everyone as well) but don't forget the tissues. (Oh, and I didn't go to see the film at the cinema, I prefer waiting and seeing it on TV.) http://foxyandthings.blogspot.fr/",Berenice Benard
9780141345659,"This book was utterly stunning. ""Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book."" I started reading this book one night after a friend had recommended it to me. Let's just say, I later finished the book early the next morning. I was so drawn to the story of Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace that I could not put the book down, even when I had finished and my face was drenched in tears I did not want it to be over. John Green introduced me to an all encompassing love story in which the trials of life were unable to defeat the hearts of two souls that depended on each other in order to exist beyond their cancer driven lives. It is a light read and touched on a delicate subject but John did it justice. John Green speaks to the readers with quotes that touch on our everyday lives and encourage us not to be beaten down by life but to walk hand-in-hand with it, be swept into the dance of living and tango the night away. To sum up, I loved this book, I loved the characters, I loved that it was a romance without being a romance and that this book made me cry more then any other novel I have read. If you have not read this yet, I recommend you do and I only hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Courteney
9780141345659,I think this is possibly my favorite book that I've read this year. John Green has a beautiful way of writing and using words in a way that makes me fall in love with all of his books. He made me forget that Hazel and Augustus have cancer and I was heartbroken when I finished the book. This is definitely a sign that it is a good book. It's so good that I've read it twice now and I want to read it again. This book is one of the few books that I want to read again for the first time and experience that emotional rollercoaster all over again.,Clarissa
9781408832332,"When people talk about this book, and Celaena they mention that she is beautiful, arrogant and girly. Not usually traits I particularly like my female protagonists to have, yet Celaena pulled it off incredibly well. I was terrified that this girl would end up like whatshername from Paranormalcy, girly and arrogant to the point of stupidity, but no. Celaena has her reasons to be arrogant; she's good at what she does and she is deadly beautiful. You really feel for this character. Orphaned at a young age, trained in sometimes dreadful ways and then betrayed and left to rot as a slave for a year in a place most people only last a month. She has been beaten and broken and yet she remains a fighter. I expected this to be a decent book about palace politics and a female assassin fighting for freedom, but it was so much more. It was a book about friendships, love, magic and not letting the world break you. I never expected so much depth, or magic. The relationships between people are perfectly built. If Celaena doesn???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??t like someone your skin crawls as well. If she befriends them you feel yourself growing attached. The relationships never feel forced, or at least they don???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??t till right at the end. And while there is a love triangle it doesn???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??t take president over the story itself it just develops naturally throughout. The magic element is never really mentioned in reviews so when it became a big part of the plot I was incredibly happy and surprised. What???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??s a good fantasy without magic? The magic here makes you feel like something bigger is going on, that Celaena has a destiny that is only hinted at throughout the book bot not revealed. This aspect will certainly make me want to read the next book. Overall though this review isn???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??t particularly good, it???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??s been a long time since I???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??ve actually done a written one, I???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??d say the book it???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??s self is good. It???????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??s not written in a way that makes you want to tattoo the whole thing over your body but the world building is superb, the characters are well fleshed out and the plot is all but simple.

9781408832332,"In Sarah J. Maas debut novel, Throne of Glass, Celaena has her first chance at freedom since being imprisoned in a salt mine slave camp for her crimes. I know what your thinking, but she wasn't wrongly imprisoned - Celaene is an assassin. So when the Crown Prince offers her freedom, she can't help but look for the catch. Prince Dorian want her to be his champion in the competition to become the kings assassin. Maas's style of writing is really captivating. She uses the language well, with the scenes in the novel all flowing into one another and before I knew it, hours had pasted and I had a fair chunk of the novel finished. You know its good writing with a captivating plot when you lose track of time. I though that the characters were well developed with each having their own quirks and strengths making them each their own. I did have a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to say some of the characters' names, and it wasn't until after that I found the Throne of Glass Pronunciation Guide on Maas's website. I think not being about to say a character's name is one of the most annoying thing that could happen when reading a book - especially if it is one of the main characters. I find that I either came up with my own pronunciation or just make up an entirely different name for the character. That is probably the only problem that I had with this novel. I liked the relationships between the characters. Celaena's with Chaol had to be my favourite, probably because that neither of them could see or admit to themselves that they had feelings for one another. I found it sweet how Chaol was both terrified and memorised by Celaena and how they both fought for dominance in his mind. Now, I'm probably going to piss some people off by this next statement, but they're just going to have to such it up. I really don't like Dorian, especially with Celaena. He just seems like a total ***** to me. He doesn't like the way that his father is running the kingdom, but rather than confront him about it, he finds petty little ways to spit him - like having Celaena as his champion. And then there's the fact that he's a womaniser. Now, I'm not saying that this makes him a bad character, just the opposite. That I feel so strongly about this is a tribute to Maas's writing and her ability to make her characters get under my skin and care about them and their traits. So hats off to her! I thought that Throne of Glass was well paced and had the perfect ratio of mystery to rate at which things were discovered and understood so that no frustration was felt at the lack of knowledge or a clueless MC that didn't figure things out until they are told. I also enjoyed the cleverly planned plot twist and the awesome fight scenes. Maas's debut novel Throne of Glass is a wonderful start to her YA career, she blew me away with her clever plot line and dynamic characters. Excellent! Definitely a book that I recommend!",Renae Hawke
9781408832332,"Favourite Quote: ""We each survive in our own way."" Going to start with the things I liked about this book. First of was the characters, I actually liked most of them which is very unusual. Celaena was a very strong heroine, which is sometimes hard to find in YA novels. She was strong, skilled, smart, funny and everything else that is needed to make a great main character. Then there was Chaol, who I loved he was a strong, loyal, caring warrior whom I was rooting for. And finally the other character I really liked was Prince Dorian who was very sweet, kind, good-looking and flirty, who wouldn't like him?! The rest of the character were okay I didn't care much for them but that may change in future novels. I had mixed feelings on the plot. The first half of it I really loved, though the Champion tournament did remind of the Hunger Games a little, but it was unique in its own way. Then magic was introduced. I am not the biggest fan of fantasy and I never knew this was a fantasy novel. The whole magic element turned me off a little which is half the reason I rated it a 4 star instead of 5. Some of the plot it was predictable such as who was behind the mystery killings, seriously I knew straight away it was that obvious. But overall I thought the plot was very well developed and I enjoyed it. Onto the things I didn't like, starting with the over-use of exclamation marks. This is only a minor thing but it irritated the hell out of me, seriously there was at least two in each paragraph. Another minor things were all the names that I found hard to pronounce. The only major thing I didn't like was the love triangle. I'm not a lover of those and definitely not a lover of this one. Although I liked Celaena, Dorian and Chaol individually, I didn't like Celaena and Dorian's romantic relationship it was just clich???????????????Â©ï¸ and I think they make better friends then lovers, for me there wasn't real romantic chemistry. I much prefer Chaol and Celaena. Overall I give this book a 4/5 stars, the magic and the love triangle brought it down a star. I would recommend this to people who like historical fiction, fantasy and action novels.",brookexx
9781408832332,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Bloomsbury Publishers and Netgalley.) 18-year-old assassin Celaena has been imprisoned in the salt mines of Endovier for a year when the Crown Prince Dorian of Adarlan comes to her with a proposition - become his champion, fight against other champions to become the king's champion, and after 4 years of service - win back her freedom. Celaena accepts; people don't last long in Endovia, and she has already outlived many by surviving a year. Thus begins Calaena's journey, only there is more to fear in Adarlan than she ever imagined. I loved this book! I sometimes find fantasy books a bit slow and sticky, and feel like I'm having to drag myself through them - not this one though! This one is a real keeper! Celaena is a great character - she's strong, she's independent, not afraid to stick up for herself or go for what she wants, whilst at the same time knowing her own limits, and knowing how far to push things. She's intelligent, but knows when to ask for help, and has a keen eye for detail, she's also happy to put the work in to her training, but at the same time appreciates a pretty dress as much as a fine weapon. Celaena isn't the only character to love though, with two equally gorgeous guys falling over themselves to get at her. Dorian, the crown prince, who is drawn to her even though he knows their relationship couldn't go anywhere, and Chaol - captain of the royal guard. Both find themselves wanting to spend more and more time with Celaena, and both of them are so lovely, I really can't decide who I think Celaena should end up with! There's more than just boys in this storyline though; we have champions, tests and duels, a foreign princess, outlawed magic, spirits of the dead, and nightmare creatures. This book is action packed, and there's not a dull moment. If I had to be picky, I would suggest that there's not much said about Celaena's past as an assassin; we know how it happened, we know who trained her, but we don't know anything else then until she ends up at Endovia, or even how she ends up at Endovia - I wonder if this will be covered in later books or maybe in the prequels? Anyway, that aside, this is a fantastic book, and a must-read this summer. If you have any interest in the fantasy genre at all - pick this up! You won't be disappointed! 9 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781408832332,"I loved this book so much. From the first page, I really like Celaena and it wasn't long before I was a big fan of Chaol and Dorian too. The Crown Prince of Ardalan, Dorian, takes Celaena from the mines in Endovier where she's imprisoned for being the infamous ""Ardalan Assassin."" He wants her to compete in a competition that his father is having to find a personal assassin for the king. Dorian wants her to be his champion, and if she wins, after four years of service to the king, she will be granted her freedom. Celaena really has no choice but to agree as she knows she won't survive much longer in the mines. The Captain of the Guard, Chaol Westfall, takes charge of her. He helps her with her training to get back in shape and prepare for the competition, shows her around the castle and sometimes dines with her in her rooms, but always ensures that she is guarded. I really enjoyed the banter between Chaol and Celaena, you could gradually see their opinions of each other change. Celaena had kind of a smart, funny attitude when she wanted to and Chaol was a more serious character but I loved the way they bounced off each other. Some of my favourite parts of this book were probably when they were together. Celaena's character was a surprising one. I would have thought an infamous assassin would be rough and tough but she's completely girly and loves getting dressed up in fancy dresses. She's a beautiful, mostly pleasant, caring girl who just happens to also be a trained killer. It's not long before she's attracting the attentions of Dorian and he is flirting with her and hanging out in her rooms, much to the chagrin of Chaol. I felt there was also some attraction between Chaol and Celaena but we have to wait until the next book to see if anything progresses there. I was totally in love with Chaol and while I would have preferred for there not to be a love triangle, it didn't take from my enjoyment of the book at all. Most of the action in this book surrounds the final test in the competition when there is only four competitors left. This was just a fantastic part that I really enjoyed. This book is an absolute page turner and it kept me entranced from start to finish. This wasn't a book I thought I would enjoy from reading the blurb, and it was the good reviews I read that pushed me to read it. I am so glad I did. Sometimes, I love a book so much that I feel I can't write a review that will justify what an awesome book it really is. This is one of those times. So I just urge anyone who hasn't already, to pick up a copy and see for yourself how great this is.",Suzanne Finnegan
9781408832332,"To be honest, I hadn't really heard of this book until I was asked if I'd like to review it. After a quick search around the internet, it was crystal clear that this was one of the books to get excited about, so I jumped at the chance! As you'll all know by now, I'm intimidated by high fantasy, but I've been stepping out of my reading comfort zone a lot this year and so I gave this a go. As expected, I did find the book a little difficult at first. The book is quite different to what I've read before in terms of both ideas and setting, so it did take me some time to adjust. Thankfully, it didn't take too long to get into it and despite still remaining a little confused, it wasn't overwhelming. This isn't a simple story where everything is given to you on a plate - there are lots of little clues scattered throughout the story, so it's important to try and concentrate on everything. The only thing I can really compare it to is the way that J.K. Rowling has a meaning and story behind everything - there were actually a few things that reminded me of the Harry Potter series throughout, and I can't complain about that! Maas has crafted her story with great intelligence and thought. Mass has immense potential to make this into an even more complex story as she continues the series. Throne of Glass focuses on Celeana Sardothien's attempt to become the King's Champion, by fighting in a tournament in order to be named as the one who protects the King and carries out various 'tasks' for him for four years, after which, she will be granted freedom. There is a lot of mystery throughout and also quite a bit of action, but the real action occurs near the end, where we see Celeana actually battle the other contestants. It does sound a similar idea to The Hunger Games and it did remind me of it very slightly, but no complaints there as the story in general is very different. The fight scenes were slightly more gruesome than I thought they'd be, but in the best possible way - it felt as though nothing was being held back. Celeana also has some important dreams and hallucinations which are written very well. The characters were interesting. I liked Celeana, our main kick-ass character, who was witty and had a confident attitude. We don't really know much about her at the beginning apart from that she was the assassin of Adarlan, sent to the country's salt mines to work as a slave. I wasn't completely blown away by her, but she wasn't a bad character in the slightest - I just wanted something a little more unique. I did like that her femininity did show in the story, whilst she was still a fierce character. I absolutely loved the UK cover for this book, but after reading it, I feel as though the US cover is slightly more fitting - it reminds me that Celeana is in fact just meant to be a young girl. I think that 'romance' in the book was the one thing that made me a bit hesitant about the characters. The obvious love-triangle is sort of introduced, but I was grateful that it certainly wasn't the focus of the book. There was an underlying and quite subtle romantic theme which did work as it was, but it will be interesting to see how it progresses in the next books. I really liked Captain Chaol Westfall and despite his somewhat promiscuous reputation, I thought Prince Dorian wasn't bad either - I did grow to like him, especially once I learnt about his vast collection of books. I do find myself rooting for a certain character, Chaol, and I think it is going to be very interesting to learn more about him, especially after his actions in this book. Of course, there are a multitude of other characters that we are introduced to - including the charming Princess Nehemia and the wicked Lady Kaltain. There is a whole load of people and just things in general that I could mention - I could keep on typing for days! This book just feels so 'full' and the length is certainly justified. Maas has obviously done her best at creating the world inside the palace and she has done it brilliantly - I would just like to discover more about what's happening/has happened outside too. I never thought I'd get through a 400+ page high fantasy book, but I have been impressed. The writing and depth in Throne of Glass was superb, and I'll be looking forward to reading more of this series.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

I give The Hunger Games: Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins 5 out of 5 stars.",TheBookWorm123
9781407109367,"Whilst I believe 'Catching Fire' is the weakest book in the series, that doesn't mean I didn't thoroughly enjoy it. That just goes to prove how good this series is. Whilst 'The Hunger Games' series is not perfect (the writing is a little simple at times and there is a noteworthy lack of character development and detail- they often seem a little shallow, unlike other YA characters which can seem so vivid), it is a very engaging and provocative read. 'Catching Fire' is the middle book, the joiner between the games and the ultimate conclusion in 'Mockingjay'. Because of this, the book does fall into some of those traps of repetition that many 'filler' or 'bridge' books often do. However, the story does amplify the growing tension in Panem and explores deeper into the rising paranoia, fear and dissension. Essentially, this book helps to build the anticipation and the tension introduced in the first book. It takes the reader further into the issues facing Panem, the struggles in the districts and the changing political atmosphere. Whilst it does rush a little bit towards the last third of the book, I think the book's strong point is the beginning section of intrigue and build up which helps to provide a good foundation going into 'Mockingjay'. Whilst it isn't as good as 'The Hunger Games', it is still fantastically written and very confronting. Recommend to anyone.",H.
9781407109367,"""...Catching Fire, just like its predecessor, is absolutely amazing. The entire series so far is thrilling; Collins writes in such a way that it is very easy to become immersed in the world she has created in Panem: to visualize the surroundings as if you were there yourself, to find yourself crying with and for characters at emotional moments, to find yourself holding your breath for several pages before finally sighing with relief or gasping and/or yelling out of something else entirely, be it anger, disbelief, or surprise. There is every bit as much suspense and action as in The Hunger Games - arguably more, even, and the stakes are much higher now that the citizens of all the districts are potentially involved, affected by whatever move is made. This time, it isn't just about killing or out-living 23 other people. It's about Prim. Rue's family. Gale. Peeta. Her mother. Everyone...""

It made me gasp and let me have a chuckle, made my heart race and then stop. The story went in an absolutely unpredictable direction, and after a twist half-way through the book, I felt too scared to go on because I was afraid of what I might find on each next page, but at the same time I was dying to get to the end to find out how everything does turn out.

9780142402511,"Review: Divided in two parts Looking for Alaska was for me actually 50% slow till somehow boring and 50% an intense, heart-broken story about friendship and fate. It talks a lot about teenagers, their young life among other teens and their developments concerning social in particular. So the ?C/??before?C/?? part which goes till exactly page 133 was surely interesting, cause I got to know every character and witnessed their daily life at Culver Creek Boarding School. Miles, who didn?C/??t have real friends ever before, makes the experience of having some and finally does what all teens do. But this part got somehow long and tedious for me. For sure there were some nice quotes of Alaska or the Colonel but it didn?C/??t keep me eager to read on. So once landed at the end of part one I was rewarded for the about 120 pages I read before, cause what then happened just blew me away. And I didn?C/??t see it coming. The remaining 80-90 pages were read in a high speed because it was so different to the ?C/??before?C/?? part in many aspects. The plot twist, the atmosphere?C/??|it even felt like the writing changed. It got profound and philosophical so finishing this felt like a learning process the way we experience it more often with John Green books. I honestly had no specific relation to the characters first. They were in some way neutral to me. TILL the ?C/??after?C/?? part as you might guess. The Colonel showed facets of himself, I was surprised of in a positive way and Alaska got more special to me the more she left secrets behind. Miles however was thoughtful throughout the book, which was interesting but not too fascinating. What I really liked about those teenagers was how they stick together and integrated Miles, when he was the new guy. Even though they are all quite different, they found a way to respect each other and hold on to their own believes and interests. In my mind, the book could have been even shorter. For me especially the second part was dominant and succinct and this part is unfortunately shorter than the ?C/??before?C/?? part. Looking for Alaska was a good read but it didn?C/??t live up to the expectations I have when I pick a John Green book up. (not according to the rave of many readers) It?C/??s an ordinary though dramatic story which sets you thinking about the simple things in life. I have now read four books of John Green and think that might be enough. Rating: ?C/???C/???C/???C/???C/?? 3 of 5 stars",Isabel Lazarovici
9780142402511,"So I should start by saying, another terrific read from John Green! He is definitely a fantastic writer. I have never written a review but couldn't resist with this one. Everything about this story is so honest and raw. The characters are all well developed and definitely reflect the inner feelings and emotions we suffer and experience every day. The story of Alaska was definitely tragic, from her self-hatred to the trail of destruction she happened to unintentionally leave behind. It reminds us all of how we can be, if not for those around us to hold us and keep us from falling apart. Pudge to me acted as a symbol for the loneliness everyone feels, and shows the need for human interaction and love that he constantly seeks. It is without a doubt, that every one at some point, feels alone and seeks for the Greater Perhaps. He prompts us to remember the love we have around us, and to just believe we all have a greater purpose, we just need to look and find our belonging.

9781484707234,The Percy Jackson series has always been one of my favourite series. These covers are beautiful and great for my collection of books. Only downside is that the pages are very thin and crinkle easily creating an effect that looks like its been wet and then dried... The books themselves are amazing but the quality of the printing/materials could be improved.,Emma
9781447263227,"I had not yet read a Rainbow Rowell book when i pic this one up. Im glad that i did. This book was amazing. I really loved and enjoy this book. This is my new favorite book. I could really ese myself in Cath. Sometimes scary but otherwise just cool. This book has everything. Humor, love you name it. If you have not read this one. Pic it up and do it right away. You will not be disappointed.",Olivia Borgstrom Alstig
9781447263227,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a quirky, uplifting and fun book, and if you have enough time; you'll probably read through it in one time. I really loved how it was different than any other book I've ever read. It was lighthearted but at the same time had some great messages hidden in between the lines. The only thing that bothered me were the small pieces of fanfiction or a passage of the 'book' Simon Snow. At first it was fun to read, to get a bit of a taste of what Cath is writing and obssesing over in this book, but as time passes and pages turn, it gets slightly boring. This however, did not take away much of the reading fun, as you can just skip it because it isn't closely related to this story. In the future I'll enjoy reading more books from Rowell, because I surely recommend this book to anyone who's searching for a lighthearted summer book.",Carlotte Aarts
9781447263227,"I utterly enjoyed reading Fangirl. It was light and cute and quirky. If you've been reading my reviews, you probably know by now that light-cute-quirky is a winning combination for me. So why 3 out of 5 stars only for Fangirl? It's enjoyable, yes. It's the sort of book that relaxes you when you read it. And it had the same effect on me. But half the time I was reading the book, I couldn't see where the story was heading. It was like things were going in circles. And even until the end, I felt like there were still some loose ends. Or maybe that's just Rainbow Rowell's style, I don't know. It just irked me a bit. ""Real life was something happening in her peripheral vision."" Anyway, enough with the negativity. What I liked about Fangirl is that it showed a lot more about being, well, a fangirl. I totally connected with Cath. The introversion, the awkwardness, the trust issues, the not smiling to people. It was like reading a character that reflects myself (if only a bit). And she's a really good fanfic writer. I liked that there were snippets of her fic and then there were bits of the real Simon Snow books to distinguish Cath's style from Gemma T. Leslie's. And her passion for Simon and Baz! Only a fangirl would understand. *swoon* And the characters! They're unbelievable. Wren is like the extrovert version of Cath. She's a fangirl, too, but not as hardcore as her sister. I just wish there's more of Wren in Fangirl. I love their relationship. I admire their closeness. They were each other's rock that anchors them to themselves. They were not just sisters; they're best friends. Reagan, Cath's room mate, is also something. She's more like Wren but like a harder, tougher, older, bolder version. It's a surprise she got along with Cath (eventually). But I love Reagan still. And dear Levi. He's not a perfect guy but somehow he's perfect for Cath. Sometimes he's adorable, sometimes he's annoying. Levi might be a cliche, but this cliche will make you swoon. A few things aside, Fangirl is the perfect book if you are looking for a light and laid-back read. Very real and relatable. Rainbow Rowell succeeded in showing the joy and pain of being a fangirl. I only have one question, though: ""Does Cath kill off Baz?""",Julie Rimpula
9781447263227,"4/5 stars I decided to pick up ""Fangirl because I wanted to take a break from another (fantasy) book I'm reading. Going into it, I knew I was probably going to like it. If not a lot, at least a little. As it turned out, I was right---about liking it. ^.^ One thing that made this book stood out to me is the fact that I could relate to Cath, the main character, even though I'm not in any of the exact/same situations(s) as her. And although I don't really write that much fan fiction (nowhere near not as much as Cath did/does xD), I understood how she felt about being in a world that's apart from your own---apart from your own reality, and wanting to be in it, in whichever way possible. I do admit though, I wish she trusted herself more, with having to try and create her own original story. However, I also knew where she was coming from. (Some spoilers ahead.) Moving onto the side characters. I really like Reagan, Levi, Wren (but not so much when she was distant and unfriendly toward Cath---I still don't get why she would ignore her like that) and Arthur (Cath & Wren's dad, Mr. Avery). I'm gonna start with Reagan. Let me just say: she was absolutely hilarious. I would crack up whenever she says something sarcastic or funny. xD Sometimes, I'd even re-read those passages, which always never fail to make smile. Sure, I didn't like how she acted sometimes, but it's like that with every character. They all have their flaws, and that's fine. That's what makes them, well, them. ^.^ Now, onto Levi. He's so sweet and cheery. How can anyone NOT like him? I mean, come on! He's like the light to a gloomy, dark day. I always smile when he appears. (Cath is so luck. And Reagan too.) Shifiting over to Wren. I sort of already went over my thoughts about her, so there's nothing much else to say. Adding on, though, I guess, I just wished Wren was there for Cath when she needed someone to talk to. Going back to what I commented before, I don't understand why she abandoned Cath like that... It was as if all of a sudden, she wanted to go off on her own, without Cath at all. That didn't make sense to me because from the past dialog/memory scenes of her & Cath, Wren was so close and caring toward Cath. What made me like her, even a little, was that she stood by Cath AFTER their dad punished her, and made her go back every weekend. I kind of wanted them to make up on their own. But I guess in a way, they did---which was good. And last not least: Arthur (or Mr. Avery, aka Cath & Wren's father). I admit, even though, he's a little looney in the head, I still really liked, and quite frankly, admired him. That scene when he was hugging Wren & Cath in the hospital... Man, I couldn't help but say: Aww! He didn't say much, but somehow, I felt like he did. He's just such a loving father. Especially when he realized that in order for Cath not to worry about him so much, he got to start taking care of himself. (Or get some help taking care of himself, aka asking for Cath & Wren's grandma.) I mean, I'm not sure if he did completely, but it seemed like he did, somewhat. Out of all of the main female protagonists, I would say that Cath is one that I found myself connecting to the most. That's also probably why I was always rooting for her. I wanted her to finish her story---for Fiction-Writing as well as Carry On, Simon. I wanted her to talk it out with Wren (and vice versa). I wanted her to make up with Levi. I wanted her to be happy with where she was. I still do. (Spoilers end here.) All in all, I really enjoyed reading ""Fangirl."" It made me want to make more progress with my writing, and perhaps, meet more new people. ^.^ ***This book is also posted on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/941035690?book_show_action=false",Alice
9781447263227,"Review also available on my blog: http://readingismycupoftea.tumblr.com/post/91771951736/review-fangirl-by-rainbow-rowell Hey guys! I know I?C/??m a bit late to jump on the Fangirl bandwagon. With everybody raving about it I went into this book with very high expectations. Even with the odds against it, in my view, I did enjoy Fangirl. However, although the book was good, I did find it lacking some things. I?C/??ll start with the negatives. At the end of each chapter there was an extract from either the Simon Snow books (the fictional books which the protagonist, Cath, fangirls over) or from Cath?C/??s fanfiction of these books. When I first heard about extracts being used in a review I read before the book, I was really excited and interested in how Rowell would utilise them. The problem, for me, is that the extracts, particularly from the Simon Snow books, seemed completely irrelevant to the book. I mean, once you?C/??ve grasped that Simon Snow is meant to be Harry Potter you don?C/??t really care about tiny, irrelevant extracts from it. Cath?C/??s fanfiction, although more relevant as it gives the reader an insight into how her mind works, does seem detached from the main story. It would have been better if, say, the Simon Snow extracts gave some message that reflected the previous chapter, or how Cath felt. Or if the extracts were from Cath?C/??s updates of her main fic Carry On, Simon and we could see how her fic developed as she developed. Even the extracts from fics written years before this book is set could have been used to contrast how Cath writes alone and how she writes with Wren. But none of this happened in any of the extracts and I had to force myself to read them at the end of each chapter, hoping they became relevant. I asked my sister about it and she said that when she read Fangirl she just skipped over the extracts. The ending was disappointing for me. There was a steady build up to the release of the eighth Simon Snow book and the anticipation to finish Carry On, Simon. But the ending kind of flopped for me. This could be because Rowell didn?C/??t want to give the book a sense of finality so she could return to the world later, but I still would have liked more information on how the eight book affected Cath, how she finished Carry On, Simon and just generally a bit more of a closed ending considering this is a stand-alone. But the thing that bugged me most about this book is how narrow its perspective is. When you tackle something like fandom (particularly if fandoms are close to your heart like mine) and name your book Fangirl, you?C/??re taking on a massive thing. There are hundreds of fandoms and hundreds of fanpeople(?) and each person in that fandom has something they enjoy/contribute e.g making videos/graphics, writing fanfiction, writing songs, cosplay etc. Inevitably some people are going to be disappointed. When I heard that Fangirl was a YA book about fandom I was expecting all this to be incorporated. So when I discovered it was just about fanfiction I was kind of disappointed. I think the most important thing about fandoms and fangirls is the sense of community, support and understanding you get. The main downfall for me was that Fangirl had no real sense of fandom community and was focused on Cath individually. There was nothing about Cath talking to other fangirls, or interacting with anybody online. We all have a few people who we talk to regularly online and perhaps even consider friends. I would have expected somebody like Cath, like ME, would be talking lots to online friends about a big experience like university. I also wanted there to be a more universal view of the fandom, more fanart, more videos, graphics, cosplay, songs etc. Let me reiterate. I enjoyed Fangirl a lot. But I think when you sell a book as Fangirl and being about fandom you need to make it more elaborate. Fangirls don?C/??t just write fanfiction. We communicate and socialise with other people online. Frequently. I felt like Fangirl stuck to the fanfiction but didn?C/??t expand. Which isn?C/??t bad, but if you sell a book as a book about a fangirl, I expected?C/??|more fangirling. However, that being said, Fangirl was a lovely book. Everyone has different opinions about what is most important in a book: plot, setting, description, dialogue. For me, I think it?C/??s the characters. Even if the plot is mindblowingly good, if the characters are rubbish then the plot doesn?C/??t work and the book fails for me. I loved the characters in Fangirl. I have social anxiety and hearing about Cath?C/??s nerves about university (e.g. going to the dining hall/finding a seat) is something I know I?C/??ll get nervous about too. Reading this so close to uni with a protagonist so like me was almost reassuring me that uni will be okay. Cath?C/??s only downside was the fact she handed in fanfiction as her own work and got upset when her teacher called it plagiarism. What else did she expect?? That aside Cath is a lovely and relatable character. I also loved Wren and the adorable (and refreshingly understanding) Levi. But my favourite has to be Reagan. I love her character as she is so real. She?C/??s spiky but sweet and I think it?C/??s great how she doesn?C/??t try to understand Cath but accepts her. Overall, Fangirl is a wonderful book about coming of age and facing scary but inevitable experiences like university. I was just disappointed by the fact it was sold as Fangirl but only incorporated one element of fandom and no real sense of the vital community that fandoms produce. 3 stars. How did you find Fangirl? :) -Molly",Molly Gibson-Mee
9781447263227,"It is going to be very hard for me to not to fangirl ;-) all through this review because I absolutely loved it. I have it on my Kindle but believe me, I will be buying a physical copy so I can re-read it in all its tactile glory. Fangirl tells the story of Cath as she starts university and all the troubles that that entails for the incredibly shy introvert that Cath is. Making this big scary step even scarier is the fact that her twin sister Wren wants to go her own way in university ????????????????????????????????????C/?? to not room with Cath and develop her own circle of friends separate from Cath. Cath????????????????????????????????????C/??s only escape from the real world is her love of Simon Snow (think Harry Potter) and the fanfiction she writes about his world. On top of this, she has to deal with a gruff never there roommate and her always there boyfriend, a cute classmate who is only interested in her for one thing but it????????????????????????????????????C/??s not what you think and a writing professor who wants her to expand her writing outside of fanfiction. Plus, a dad who is not coping so well now he????????????????????????????????????C/??s on his own and absent mother who wants back in her life. Phew! I loved Cath from the get-go, she is a girl after my own fangirl heart, we may obsess over different things ????????????????????????????????????C/?? I don????????????????????????????????????C/??t write or read fanfiction but I understand why people do ????????????????????????????????????C/?? but both our obsessions make the real world a bit more bearable. She is so realistically drawn (as are all the characters) that as a fellow introvert, it is easy to connect with her. I adored Levi (the roommate????????????????????????????????????C/??s always there boyfriend) and I want one for myself, he is just simply, well, adorable. It took a little while for me to warm up to Cath????????????????????????????????????C/??s twin Wren and her roommate Reagan, but once I did, I loved them too. I really liked how important relationships were in this book - parent/child, siblings, friends and lovers. Her relationship with her dad is so cute; I wish the relationship with my dad was like that. As much as Cath could happily shut herself off from the real world and only having contact with her dad and sister, she learns that she needs other people ????????????????????????????????????C/?? real life people. The character growth for Cath was realistic ????????????????????????????????????C/?? she didn????????????????????????????????????C/??t suddenly become an extrovert but she did slowly come out of her shell, although not all the way, which again is realistic. Speaking of slow developing, the romance was also on slow boil and was super sweet. I also really liked that every chapter ended with either an excerpt from a Simon Snow novel or from Cath????????????????????????????????????C/??s own fanfiction. It was like a story within a story, a story that I wish was real because I really like Baz ????????????????????????????????????C/?? Simon Snow????????????????????????????????????C/??s nemesis, roommate and maybe lover. I recommend this book to anyone who loves contemporaries, coming of age stories, romances and books with socially awkward characters. If you read and loved Eleanor and Park by Rowell, you will love this too. Thank you Rainbow Rowell, for your wonderful books and your real and relatable characters.

9781407132099,"Catching Fire continues the story around Katniss, Peeta and the Hunger Games. In my experience second novels in a trilogy or quartet often lack of adventure or originality. They show the major elements of separating the main couple, following their grief and desperation to end with their reunion. Catching Fire binds Katniss and Peeta even more together, but with no less danger. What I liked most about Catching Fire is that Katniss and Peeta start as a team right from the beginning of this new Hunger Games. They are no longer on their own, which makes them strong and superior. We already know about their complementary characters and their feelings for each other. The more Peeta and Katniss grow together the more I like them and feel emotionally affected by their every disappointment or victory. Another likeable aspect about the second Hunger Games novel, in so far an inhuman battle can be likeable, is that there are not only enemies, Katniss and Peeta make new friends. Catching Fire displays two games simultaneously. The first is a major political and social against hunger and death and for life and reputation in form of the Hunger Games. The second is a personal and emotional one that may have the power to be even more destructive than any Hunger Games before. Cruel actions and traps change with most emotional scenes, affection and signs of love on the one hand and senseless and sudden death of beloved characters on the other. Collins powerful story moves me to tears, makes me feel angry, flustered and ecstatic at the same time, but the end it always leaves me craving more. This novel is Collins' opportunity to give room for ""positive"" emotions in a world that feeds from hatred and fear and provide a smooth transition to the last and decisive battle. The structure of action is comprehensible and as exciting and adventurous as in The Hunger Games before. Suzanne Collins once again shows her talent as a brilliant storyteller and ""event manger"". Catching Fire is an unequalled book in the dystopian YA genre, I couldn't lay it down. THE VERDICT Keep a fire extinguisher near you when starting the second novel of this hugely successful trilogy, you'll easily catch fire. And your agitation can only be satisfied by Mockingjay, the final instalment to The Hunger Games series!",MissPageTurner

9780525426004,"I've never thought of this as a bad book; in fact I quite enjoyed reading it. However like several others, I believe that it does not deserve the acclaim that has been lavished upon it. The first person voice of the novel was its downfall. John Green tried much too hard to write a main character that is eloquent, but is still relatable to the target audience. The result was an inconsistent and hard to believe character that oscillated wildly between a 'typical teen', and someone with the emotional insight on life that is incongruous to both her age, and the character the author was clearly trying to create. Story-wise, I found this novel to be average. Despite having some touching moments, the plot overall is contrived and lacked the more detailed nuances of human emotion that really brings a novel like this to life. I wouldn't recommend against this book, but I wouldn't recommend it either.",Mingxi Hou
9780525426004,"To be completely honest i thought this book was highly overrated. Dont get me wrong, I did enjoy it, i just dont think it deserves all the acclaim it's received.

9781904233657,"Twilight was my first ""bridge"" to vampire romance and the return to reading daily several genres of books. My love for other worlds beyond the pages was always an addiction and this book hit the target. So about Bella, she was to me a very grown up character and very well created heroin. With her soft, quiet personality, she is the image that simple is beautiful. Edward was the prince charming that everyone dreamed of at that age. Protective and dangerous, a vampire should you imagine, that falls hopelessly in love with a weak mortal woman. This two along with the feelings that words can take effect on readers along this ride created a recipe for success that took over the world by storm and entered in our tv and movie screens to always remember love.",Patricia Melo
9781904233657,The plot is not written very well at all. The characters are undefined and static. I think the love between Edward and Bella is real but if it moved slower it would have been a much better book. The only other thing I wish the author would have added was a little REAL drama and kept the love in the background. I would not recommend this book.,Sarah
9781904233657,"Like most things in life there will be people who love a certain thing and there will be those who absolutely hate it. This book (and saga) is certainly one of them.

It's not the worst book I've read but neither is it the greatest.

9781904233657,"Unlike previous reviews that have been written for this book mine will not have unwarranted capital letters and exclamation points (In the intrest of your sanity). This novel has a very boring, plain and not-very-well-described main character - Bella. This was most likely done in an effort so the tween females reading the novel can imprint their own personalities and looks onto her, and have vampire fantasies. There is no denying that the dominant reading portrays females as damsels in distress, unintelligent and always in need of a male to be around. In my opinion, Stephenie Meyer should have focused more on the vampire side of the story - going into more depth with those characters and their abilities. In addition, to, of course giving the main characters - Edward aswell as Bella, personality. There is literally no word-painting in this novel. Overall, Your'e going to read it anyway because of how successful it is therefore this review is redundant.",Andi

9781408834947,"Not a book for the faint hearted - Celaena presents the king with a severed head in a bag within the first few pages - Crown of Midnight is a fantastic continuation of the story which started in Throne of Glass. Celaena has four years to earn her freedom from the ruthless King of Adarlan. But it's not going to be an easy task. Ominous shadows, spies, wyrdmarks and other magical threats haunt the castle. Celaena has to navigate cautiously into the outlawed realm of magic to save other kingdoms from Adarlan's power-hungry King whilst appearing to do his bidding. I love the characters in this book. Celaena is every bit the cold-hearted blade for hire when necessary. But she's also fiercely loyal to those she loves. Romantically, things develop at a great pace and I loved reading the softer side of Celaena in love. Prince Dorian is also a character in turmoil - with his body betraying him and the things that he's known all his life changing before his eyes. This wasn't something I was expecting but enjoyed reading it. Chaol, Nehemia and other favourites from Throne of Glass are still around making things interesting along with a host of new characters with their own agendas. There's never a boring moment in this novel. Awakening magic, Celaena's job as an assassin, political threats and other tragedies keep the plot moving at a fast pace, There's a lot of twist and turns that I wasn't expecting but fit perfectly. Heart break and misfortune seem to follow these characters however they seem stronger for it. I loved this series and recommend it to fantasy fans - young and older adults alike. There's a lot going on and I think Maas' writing style would appeal to all ages. I'm delighted that this series is going to have five books in total because after reading Crown of Midnight I can't see myself wanting to leave Celaena and the world Maas has created anytime soon.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts

9780142414934,"I honestly did not know what book I was reading at first. I guess I was confused with the beginning because it was the first John Green novel I have ever read and I wasn't familiar with John Green as an author or as person (through his Youtube channel with Hank Green). I was actually scared, that for the first time, a book was baffling to me in my first read but as I got immersed (Chapter 2), then that's when I realized how strong each character was and I felt a certain connection with them. Quentin Jacobsen or ""Q"", as the lead, is smart, charming but kind of pathetic in the ""I'm-An-Awesome-Guy-That-Can-Get-Any-Chick"" department. He is in love with Margo Roth Spiegelman, whose name is so beautiful that when I introduce the book to my friends, and I talk about Margo, I would have to say her full name every time I mention her, because the way her name rolls on your tongue is fascinating! Awesome name choice, John. Margo's character is very queer. She's odd, keeps lots of secrets and doesn't seem to trust anyone. But she is very sweet and cherishes her friendship with Q. Now, what made the book exciting was the search for the lovely Margo Roth Spiegelman through the ""clues"" that she left in the abandoned mall and it is up to Q to find her. I really loved the way Q handled the situations to find Margo with class and wit. And the paper towns' references were spot on, and intriguing! I went over some of the pages to check if I was actually right on track or it felt like I was missing something. I have to say, this is a challenging book to read, not because it is difficult, but because you have to read the story through every aspect and every detail because it is written that way, and I held to the story like there was no tomorrow and finished okay. The ending was okay, but I would've wanted something better. But I don't want to spoil the story for those who haven't read it yet. The writing is lax, very contemporary and not really daunting, but I did say you have to be mentally challenged so that you can join the ride with Q and his pals. One downside to the story was the fact that it was kind of slow. Even though there was an attention to detail that I really love, it kind of felt slow, like I was being drifted into an ocean. But it's not an action novel, so those who love to just relax will love this book! Oh yeah, the first part of the novel is the best question I have yet still to understand up to this day. Maybe I'm stupid or I just missed the signs, but I swear. Anyway, read the book perfectly well and you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",Writer For Misfits

9780142414934,"I've heard so many great things about John Green, he's like the King of YA. When I had the chance to read one of his books, I choose Paper Towns mainly because I thought the cover was interesting. I now understand why everyone seems to love his books. He has a way to create realistic characters and tell a story without boring you once. In Paper Towns, Quentin is just a normal boy living his normal life until Margo, the girl he has been always in love, open his window and ask him to help her with her revenge. Quentin is exactly like a teenage boy, I really liked him and enjoyed reading about him growing up and daring to do more with his life. But Margo is a mystery, she's an intelligent girl, popular but bored with her life. I understand why she decided to just go away, but I don't really think it was an intelligent choice. Disappearing and leaving everyone was not only selfish but even dangerous. Also, I think I missed something in the ending. After all that went through, is it going to end that way? But it was fun to read about Orlando, specially since I have been there and remembered a lot about the streets, parks, etc. (BTW, I don't think everything the stores sell there is junk, maybe because we don't have that kind of junk here!) Overall, Paper Towns is definitely worth reading and I want to read more books from John Green.

After a shared traumatic event as children (the finding of a dead body), Margo and Quentin grow apart as friends, But Q has never gotten over the ever intriguing Margo. One night many years later, Margo appears at Q's window- a night of revenge, adventure and major mischief ensues, giving Q hope for a renewed friendship-or maybe more. However things don't go as planned for Quentin, and after their night together Margo disappears, though not for the first time. As more time passes and no-one has heard anything from Margo, Q starts to wonder if she will ever come back. The many faces and eccentricities of Margo Roth Spiegelman are explored throughout the book as Q learns more and more about the girl he thought he knew. With some help from Walt Whitman and clues left by the elusive lady herself, Q sets out to follow the trail of breadcrumbs; hoping they're not just a dead end. Quentin's slightly obsessive (though well intentioned) feelings for Margo make him an endearing lead throughout the story while Margo is a complex and multi-faceted character who is almost revered by her friends and admirers-though as Q comes to learn, she is just a girl. Paper Towns is one of the most refreshing and interesting narratives out there. Green has taken a fairly simple premise (boy likes girl etc.) and woven a seamless piece of literary excellence. Quentin's honest and insightful narrative, along with laughs aplenty courtesy of best-friends, Ben and Radar, makes for a smooth, and at times hilarious, journey. He has a talent for making a complex plot seem flawlessly simple and this effortlessly genius novel is a fantastic read. I would recommend Paper Towns for anybody who wants a truly engaging, thought-provoking tale of the power (and danger) of human perceptions. RECOMMEND? YES YES YES 9/10!

9781904233916,"Eclipse was a lot better than New Moon plot-wise, but I wish the whole Bella x Edward x Jacob didn't exist. This is just about me, personally, but I hate love triangles. I know other people do, too. I don't believe a person can LOVE two people in the same time. Crush, be attracted to... yes. But not love. Some books manage to make it in a way I don't mind the love triangle that much. Unfortunately, Eclipse is not one of these cases. Considering the Twilight Saga deals with the supposedly ultimate love between Edward and Bella, it's even more aggravating that Meyer chose to push this series into a love triangle. How can you expect us to believe, as we did in Twilight, that these two truly have the purest and deepest love, if Bella herself doesn't seem so sure of that? In fact, she's so unsure she falls for another guy. I didn't stomach this well, to say the least. I also found Bella's behavior infuriating; for someone who basically gave up living the moment Edward was out of her life, she is very... fickle. Also, this book just emphasizes how useless Bella is - the only thing she's good for is... bait?! I wish she was stronger, more meaningful. As for Edward... I still love the guy--hard to erase the major crush I got on him the first book, despite everything he had done since--but he, too, could afford to be more headstrong. I mean, his girl kinda cheats on him and he's as calm about it as can be - because he 'brought it on himself'. I mean, yes - he did. But, dude, show some emotion about it! With all me saying that, Eclipse still had one of my most favorite scenes in the whole book and I did enjoy this book. Upon closer inspection, this book did have many things I disliked, but I enjoyed reading it regardless.",Nitzan Schwarz

9781904233916,"I have read all Stephenie Meyer's books of the Twilight Saga series and they are all fantastic! I am so hooked on vampires and werewolves now that I just bought the True Blood book series. Keep in mind I'm no Twihard. I'm a 31 year old woman with 2 kids. I scoffed at all these people going crazy over vampires and werewolves...laughed at them,then got curious and started reading...I'm so glad I did as they were very addictive. I enjoyed all the books. I felt like a lovestruck teenager again. 10/10!",Karen
9781904233916,"Possibly the most exciting so far in the Twilight series. Each character had been polished, developed and deepen. Includes history of Jasper and Rosalie how they ended up and stayed with the Cullen's. In this book it tells about the love triangle between Edward, Bella and Jacob. Having escaped near death experiences Bella is now faced and hunted by terrifying newborn vampires created by Victoria (who holds a grudge against Bella for being the cause James's death.) A page turner, kept me up most of many nights I just can't put the book down. Much improved compared to New Moon, this book has it all excitement, romance, emotion, edge and action! I can't wait to read the next and the last book of the series!",R.D-Diaz
9781904233916,"Wow, another page turner. A simple love story that's simply so surreal. I've never read any other romance novels and Meyer's seriously making me regret for not immersing myself more into romantic english literature 20 yrs ago at high school. This series is so good that i'm sad to be moving onto the final book next. If u've only read Twilight book 1, then u're missing out on more Twilighting. Btw, Meyer's writing skill improves with every book, and of course her storytelling style is as good as always.",Kim
9781904233916,"This book is probably the most emotional of the series. With the lives of dozens of other vampires in danger (you'll definitely need the list provided at the back of the book to keep track of all the new characters), the stakes are higher than ever. It's easy to understand the motives for the sacrifices the characters are forced to make, and the plot twists and constant action will definitely keep you up late flipping all 756 pages. Besides, despite the danger, the book isn't always serious. Emmett has plenty of irritating-big-brother jokes at the newlyweds' expense, and it's fun to see Bella finally be able to kick some butt as a ""newborn."" Overall, reading Breaking Dawn was a pleasure. Stephenie Meyer is great at what she does, great at writing for her audience, and if you can recognize that, can see that this book is exactly what it is meant to be and not expect more from it, you'll love it. The <a href=""http://personalmoneystore.com/Payday-Loans/instant-Payday-Loans/instant-Cash/ "">instant cash</a> that I used on this book was worth it. Now that it is on sale, many fans will try to grab copies.",Sylvia E.
9781416968290,"I absolutley loved this entire series, I read this book in two days and I found it so hard to put down. Through the first two books I loved Jeremiah and wanted Belly to be with him as I felt that Conrad seemed to not care about Belly as much as Jeremiah did. As I was reading the third book, i changed my views completely and loved Conrad so much more and wanted Belly to choose him instead. I cryed, laughed and got so excited through all the things Belly went through since she is so easy to relate to. This book is all I could think about when I wasn't reading and it is just a great book to put you in a good mood. I encourage everyone who loves teenage romance books, to read this amazing book because you will not regret it!! :)",Daniella Carfi
9781416968290,"So I started book one, expecting it to be a good, not THAT good! I read it in one day and I am in love with these characters, the setting, wonderful scenes from their childhood and the extraordinary summer feeling it carries. Belly is our narrator, a quirky, bright girl, that takes hearts in storm... unless they don't want to be taken. I immediately liked her and was engaged in her attempt to win Conrad Fisher's heart. She tells the story about her summer in Cousins, mixed with flashbacks to former summers, summers that meant something, had something special. The flashbacks aren't thrown into the story randomly, they are perfectly integrated, always relevant to our present scene. The word ""pretty"" in the title doesn't necessarily refer to a physical development or stunning beauty , it my opinion it stands for the metamorphosis a character can go through. Belly has developed physically but also grown psychically. Now she is experiencing a whole new array of emotions, exploring her new relationships to her big summer brothers. Our male protagonists are brothers, friends, rivals. Conrad is moody, dark and very unreasonable in his behaviour. Jeremiah is his little brother, kind and caring. We also meet Belly's brother, her mother and Susannah, Conrad's and Jeremiah's mother. The character's backgrounds, relationships and pasts are revealed gradually through the whole novel. Reading about their summer adventures, quarrels, reconciliation, friendship and love was a lot of fun. Jenny Han has a very casual writing style. I read this novel in one sitting, it very easy to read, not because of a plain content, but flowing writing. The Summer I Turned Pretty is a funny and youthful read. Special about The Summer I Turned Pretty is that its romance, happenings and emotions are anything but easy or plain because beside fun and frieds it also deals with very emotional and serious topics. THE VERDICT The Summer I Turned Pretty is a wonderful and light summer read with an authentic setting and characters and a great writing style. This novel should definitely be in the bag you pack for your next holidays!",MissPageTurner

9781904233886,"This is the second book of the Twilight Saga, and honestly, i loved it more than the first book. New Moon took alot of time from me to finish. I just would stop it, read another book, then read some of it, then stop it again, then read another book, and so on. But now, i read over 300 pages in 2 days. I LOVED it. I loved it at the beginning too, it was just that i felt lazy to continue reading it. If you havent read the first book, i advise you not to continue reading, in case i might spoil anything for you. Anyways, what i loved about this book, is how Jacob had a HUGE part. Im Team Jacob, and i just love Jacob, and i was so excited throughout the book because all of the time i was reading about him and Bella. It was different than the first book because this time, it wasnt all about the Vampires. It was more about the (SPOILER) were-wolves. Which i LOVED. Gaah i imagine them to be so hot in my head. hehehhe. What kind of bored me out, was how loooong it took for Edward to show up. I mean, everybody obviously knew he was going to come back, but it took soo long. So it kind of pissed me off when i read how depressed Bella was over and over again. After Edward does show up, maaan it was ADDICTING! The book was sooo exciting and i just couldnt put it down. So i rated this book a 5 because, i really did truly love it. Overall, it was an amazing book, and if u havent read or started the Twilight Saga, you should ;) Happy Reading Maji Bookshelf http://majibookshelf.blogspot.com/",Juhina & Farah

9781904233886,"After reading the first book of the ""Twilight"" saga I have high hopes for the second book to exceed the success of the first one but surely I felt let down. The beginning of the book is at it's most exciting and compelling but as it went on the middle part started to drag and remembering asking myself whether it was still well worth the effort to finish it. Compared to twilight this book is no match, with plots that needs mending, main characters needs rebuffing. Edward decided to leave Bella after her disastrous 18th birthday celebration at the Cullen's house. She became depressed to the point of being catatonic and still continues to be a danger magnet. Re-introduce into the picture is Jacob Black, the boy that Bella met at La Push during a beach party. A book of hope, love, forgiveness and friendship all in all still a good book to read.",R.D-Diaz

After reading Twilight and watching the movie, i read New Moon with the movie cast acting out the whole story vividly in my mind which made it even better.

9781407134611,"Blue, our protagonist, is the only non-psychic in a house full of women blessed with the gift of foresight and even though she can't see the future herself she knows well enough to heed a psychics warning. So after years of being told if she ever kisses her true love he will die she pretty much swears off boys all together, and especially Raven Boys. However, on the one night a year where the spirits of those who'll die in the next 12 months show up at an abandoned church, Blue see's her first spirit. Every year she has been with her family finding out the spirits names she's never actually been the one to see or interact with the spirits until now, when the featureless spirit of a boy in a Raven Boy's uniform shows up and tells her his name ""Gainsey"". Blue knows there is some significance to this and find out that the only reason she is able to see his spirit is because he is either her true love, or she's going to be the one to kill him, and Blue knows in her case it's likely to be both. Blue and Gainsey's lives inevitably cross paths and although they get off to a rocky start Blue realises she might have been wrong about some of the Raven Boys, named that because of the expensive private school they attend. Because of the unusual knowledge Blue has as a result of her families occupation she starts to help Gainsey and his friends on their quest to find the resting place of a supposedly dead Welsh King. When I first heard of this book I heard it was about true love (which is usually a big eye roll subject for me) and how this girl sees the spirit of her true love, who if she kisses will result in his death. That did not sound interesting at all, but after checking out Maggie's tumblr I found out it was about awesome psychic women, magic and dead Welsh kings. Then there was a chapter sampler which was just awesome and made the book seem well written and magical, so I was then immediately on Amazon buying it. The story is written in 3rd person, with switching points of view to show how different characters are feeling and how their complicated relationships work. This style was utilized incredibly well. I feel like in YA first person is used far too often so audiences can pretend to be the female narrator however this to me often leaves supporting characters (other than the main love interest who is always descried in incredible detail) feeling a little flat and lacking personality. With the way Maggie told the story you really do understand the characters and their actions a lot better than you ever would if it was Blue narrating the story as (initially) an outsider. The book definitely didn't go in any way I might have expected, although with a story this unique and fresh I didn't really expect anything at all. There's far too many Young Adult novels that now fit into a predictable story arch but this book was so different that even if it could have fit into a story arch it probably would have rebelled against what ever one it was meant to fit into. Nothing in the book felt predictable and no characters felt like stereotypes that could have been plucked from anywhere and just sort of fit in. They all felt unique and different and so at times you felt like they were all completely in synch and other times they were completely at odds with each other and themselves due to the spanners that kept being thrown into the works. I loved this book and I can't wait for the sequel in this series. I thoroughly recommend this to people who are looking for a good paranormal filled with a magical air to it and want a storyline unlike one they've read before.",Iona
9781407134611,"Favourite Quote: ""It's a hard thing to hold a civil conversation after recalling that one party has used a Taser on the other, so both of them finished the walk in silence."" I have a love/hate relationship will Maggie Stievfavter, I loved her Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, but I hated her book Ballad. So when I picked this book up I was unsure of how I was going to like it. Overall I actually did enjoy it but I did have some issues with it and that resulted in me giving this book a 3/5 stars. My first problem was this plot was interesting but still boring for the first 250 pages, there wasn't any action, and the plot was really slow. If the book had been shorter I think the plot would have been faster and therefor better. The plot did pick up in the last 200 pages and I was really good and enjoyable! Another problem was the characters, there was just so many of them that I kept forgetting who was who, very confushing and because of there being a lot of characters, I felt that we didn't get to know any of them really in depth. However I did like most of them, my favourite is probably Adam or Ronan, Gansley was okay, he's not the type of person I'd be attracted to in real life, so I didn't see him as a great love interest, Blue was okay I don't really have an opinion on her. Overall I would recommend this book for fantasy, magic lovers but I would warn that it is boring at parts. I will probably get the next book in the series but its not anywhere near the top of my TBR pile.",brookexx
9781407134611,I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. There is something about Maggie Stiefvater's characters - they are 3-dimensional and feel very real. You can't help but be drawn into the group of Raven Boys along with Blue. I can't wait for the second in the series.,Erin Pavy
9781407134611,This was a good book. I liked the way it was written. It had a sort of Shakespeare effect to it that things were told upfront so that you continued to read to find out more.

9781408851982,"I'm not normally a fan of novellas but The Assassin's Blade is a great collection of stories bridging the gap of from when Celaena Sardothien was Adarlan's Assassin to her time in the salt mines. One of the highlights of this book is you can be new to the Throne of Glass series or a veteran fan - there is something in this book for everyone. The five stories each focus on a different mission Celaena had to undertake for Arobynn Hamel - King of the Assassins. Her assignments take her from the high seas to the depths of the arid desert and back to the capital, Rifthold. No place is too remote or too dark for Celaena but we get to see that there's more to Celaena than meets the eye. Her own moral code often conflicts with that of her patron and she finds herself questioning the closest thing she has to a father. I've been a fan of Sarah J Mass' writing since I first read Throne of Glass. And whilst this collection of novellas is not required to understand and enjoy the books, The Assassin's Blade is a great addition to the world Maas has created. Thoughout this collection, Celaena's growth is evident and she's one of those characters I would NEVER want to meet but I adore reading her stories. Brave, intelligent and fierce, Celaena gives her all to everything she attempts and lives her life on the edge. She's cocky and egotistical but her track record shows she has reason to be. This book introduces some brilliant new characters - including a well dressed pirate lord, a want-to-be healer and a girl who would do anything to get revenge - and they fit perfectly in the world. I enjoyed reading Celaena's antics with these people and would love to see them pop up at a later stage in the series. Another lovely thing about these novellas is the romance. Celaena's involvement with a certain young assassin has been mentioned several times in Throne of Glass and Crown of Midnight but it was brilliant to get to see the relationship unfold from the beginning. It must have been hard to show a softer side to the legendary Adarlan's Assassin but Maas managed the task and it felt true to Celaena's character. I loved this book and am so glad that I got the chance to see where Celaena's story began. For fans of the series or those just wanting to read a great high fantasy story with brilliant characters and an assassin like no other - I could not recommend this book more highly. Great writing and engaging stories, this is a book that would appeal to young adults but also older readers too.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780141320632,"Captivating is just one of the many words to describe this story. I discovered myself hidden away from the world, while reading the tale of young children during WWII. Some what like the characters, I felt as if I was there watching as the pain slowly killed them. Only 9 years old when I escaped an orphanage on a mission to find my parents, Felix has to find a way of surviving from the Nazi's... Though how? Morris Gleitzman uses words for the readers to imagine. Doing that very well. From readers that understand happiness and that sometimes that it can take a turn, I am sure they will want to read the books over for that extra experience that we felt. I had a plan for me and Zelda. Pretend to be someone else. Find new parents. Be safe forever. Then the Nazis came.",shmeegle

He runs away to find them as he does not understand what is happening around him. His adventures are traumatic and tragic. Its hard to imagine how these children, thousands of them, had to endure these things alone with no idea whether or not they would ever see their parents again!

9780099908401,"It is always good reading a short story and there is nothing better than Hemingway's The Old Man and The Sea. It is always easy to see why this classic won the Noble Prize for Literature as it is a simple but stunning story. An old man's struggle with the elements out at sea to catch the marlin of his life time and the toll it would take it on him. He was seen as a ""Jonah"" of fishermen for the amount of time that he hadn't caught a fish. The fish that he catches drags him and the skiff out to sea for a couple of days when he finally lands the marlin he is then attacked by sharks as he brings it back to port. This book is really a metaphor for life as it doesn't matter how old you are you always need to stick at something to succeed, never give up because something is too hard. Your knowledge can help you and use it to teach others and when others are laughing at you just smile and keep on.",Paul D
9780099908401,"An old man, a boy and a giant fish. From these humble building blocks, Hemingway has constructed a stunningly simple, concise but beautiful piece of work, and arguably his masterpiece. The story takes place in a small Cuban fishing village in the 1950's. Santiago is an old fisherman on a cruel streak of luck - he has not landed a catch in eighty four days. The boy, who loves to fish with him, and who owes all his knowledge of the seas to the apprenticeship he served with Santiago has been forbidden by his father to fish with him anymore; the old man is cursed in the eyes of the villagers and his bad luck is contagious. He must now take to the seas alone. Although the boy can no longer fish with Santiago, he does all he can to help the old man he dearly loves; he brings the morning coffee to the old man's run-down shack, helps prepare his meals and humours him by listening intently to the old man's tales of the New York Yankees and his beloved Joe DiMaggio. On the eighty fifth day of his ""drought"", the old man embarks on what will be an arduous ordeal on the seas; he finally hooks one, but this is no ordinary fish - it is a giant eighteen foot-long Marlin. Thus begins an incredible struggle to land the fish which lasts for an agonising two days and two nights. It is a struggle which will not only push the old man to the very physical limits of his being but also cause him to question the nature of man's very existence with the world around him. Out of this deceptively simple scenario, Hemingway has crafted a terse, gripping and above all, an incredibly moving novel, through his use of a very simple and direct writing style which is equally accessible to adult and child alike. The novel is quite simply littered with stunning examples of this; take for example the sense of pathos created in the brief description of the old man's boat on the first page As the story progresses, you can almost feel the gentle ebb and flow of the writing sweeping you along like the current of the Gulf Stream waters which Santiago navigates. It is in the description of the battle between Santiago and the Marlin, the ferocious clash of man and beast that Hemingway's stunningly direct writing prowess soars. Gradually coming to respect his foe - in spite of the great physical pain and hardship he has caused him - Santiago begins to view the Marlin with respect and admiration and even refers to him as his brother, perfectly captured in the following passage: ""You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who"". Even the smallest details - the old man trying to take a drink of water while grappling with the fish on the line - become magnified to the level of epic struggle as Santiago bravely soldiers through his ordeal; old, weakened and alone. Written in 1951, at a point when his career had spent a decade in the doldrums, The Old Man and the Sea revived Hemingway. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953 and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize for literature, due in no small measure to the critical success of this novel. Sadly for Hemingway, this was not a portent for further success. He committed suicide in 1961, apparently ravaged by years of severe alcoholism. Rather than dwell on this unfortunate passing, I prefer to picture the author as the old man Santiago in the haunting final passage of this beautiful book, motionless and forever lost in a deep childhood reverie.",Michael McDermott
9781416995562,"It's Not Summer Without You takes place several months after The Summer I Turned Pretty and that fact already had me engaged, because I so wanted to know what happened right after the first book ended. Again the story is told from Belly's point of view who describes her current situation and only gradually reveals what happened after The Summer I Turned Pretty. Jenny Han develops a wonderful balance between present and past events on various levels. And her writing style is just as good and casual as in her first novel in the Summer series. In It's Not Summer Without You it's also Jeremiah's turn to tell several chapters from his point of view, which gives us deeper insight into his caring and fraternal character. Belly and Jeremiah often refer to Conrad, who needs to be found after he suddenly left college. Wow, I never dealed with such a difficult literary male protagonist before, when it comes to coping with his emotions and love. Han is a genius, she made me love and at the same time in some way hate Conrad's unstable character. It was so exciting to find out his motives for leaving college so suddenly, it made me understand him a bit more. The content of It's Not Summer Without You is engaging, the atmosphere isn't as relaxed as in book one, more aggressive, depressing and melancholic. The end was horribly wary and heart wrenching and I am glad I didn't have to wait one whole year for the third book. I started it immediately after I finished this novel. It's Not Summer Without You is a fast read thanks to an engaging plot and a casual writing style. Still this is no easy read as this second book in the Summer series is about deep feelings and dealing with great losses. Just like The Summer I Turned Pretty, I read It's Not Summer Without You in one day. It totally consumed me.

9780920236253,"At first, the story looks like any other fairy tale. There is a princess, a prince and a dragon, typical fairy tale characters; however, this is not your classical fairy tale. Thank god for that. Stories where princesses are waiting to be rescued by charming princes and are so delicate and helpless that they might faint any moment, are really getting old. This one is different, all the pieces of fairy tales are there (big bad dragon, a prince, a princess, a castle, the rescue and cunning) but the way they are put together is something different, something new and fresh. The language is smooth and the characters are well developed. The author managed to create real, picturesque characters with only a few lines. Forget about Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora who get their happy ending not because they are particularly smart or because they had worked hard for it but because they are beautiful, that is all. What an accomplishment. This is not what we want to teach our children. The Paper Bag Princess gives us a real heroine. The main character is strong, clever and independent, a great role model for girls and boys. The story is appropriate for children between ages 3 to 8, but even I as a grown up enjoyed reading the story. I think that has a lot to do with the story itself, characters, wonderful illustrations and humor. Humor is what gives the story that kick, children and adults alike would appreciate it greatly. The story has an interesting and unexpected ending and it makes you say: ""High five."" The story comes to life with the help of expressive illustrations: the snobbish prince, the mean and not very clever dragon and one determined princess. The illustrations are playful with a dose of funny. Nicely done.",Nadja

It subverts the normal archetypes, telling the tale of a princess whose castle is destroyed by a dragon that flies away with her prince. All her clothes having been burnt, she puts on a paper bag and follows the trail to the dragon's lair, where she outsmarts the dragon and rescues the prince. However, the snooty prince turns up his nose at her dirty appearance, leading to the princess to reply: ""Ronald, your clothes are really pretty and your hair is all neat. You look like a real prince, but you are a bum."" It still makes me laugh now. It is quite a short and simple story but nicely written and with a full illustration alongside each page. The copy I am buying now is for my 4-year old cousin. However, I didn't look at the details when I was buying, and was rather disappointed to find that this edition is TINY!! It measures 8.5 cm square, and cute as it is, does not feel like a 'real' book. So the price may be cheap, but be aware that this is the reason why - check the full product information.",Cerys

I DO NOT think it deserves the credit it gets, one of the reviews say something about being a great book for ""reluctant teens"" but if I didn't like to read and my parents gave me this to read, I would never want to read again. The point is it has a lot of innapropriate content, and it was not enjoyable. I felt sickened all over inside. I would skip this book.

9781440503252,"As an avid Harry Potter fan and something of a gastronomer, I was pretty excited about this book and it is a nice addition to my collection but I felt it lacked creativity in the recipe department and was very much for an American audience... possibly children. What I loved: The author has painstakingly gone through each of the Harry Potter books and referenced every mention of food with a recipe. There are also some interesting historical notes about the origins of certain recipes. What I didn't love: As an Australian and as a foodie, I couldn't help but groan as the author explained the bleeding obvious, a biscuit is a cookie, toffee is like taffy and so on. My annoyance peaked with her note on porridge: ""it's actually a real food that real people in the UK eat!"" I wasn't sure who this book was aimed at, it quite often seemed to be talking to a child audience (I mean, for heaven's sake, who doesn't know that porridge is a real food?) but the recipes certainly aren't child-levels of ease. The biggest let down for me though? No pictures.",victoria phillips

9781406330342,"This review also appeared on my blog www.smalltownbelles.tumblr.com STORY OF MY LIFE Now back to the real topic: If there's one thing you cannot say about Cassandra Clare's books, it's that they're predictable. You've always got to expect the unexpected and whatever that might be, whoever you think is good or bad, you're still wrong. As sorry as i am to say that. Another thing that is typical for Cassandra's novels is the amount of action she packs into the story. It's a good lot of fighting, but still never too much. I had my ups and downs with the characters in Clockwork Angel, but that can generally considered a good thing. I found Tessa to be a relatable, realistic character (except for the whole chape-changing thing obviously. By the way, i thought it to be very refreshing that she was indeed a shape-changer and not a shape-shifter. Bravo Miss Clare for setting yourself slightly apart. Jem was the kind of guy i would love to have in my life. He's genuine, raw and still edgy. He's not your perfect kid who the main character doesn't fall in love with, because the bad boy steals her heart. Talking about the bad boy. I don't actually comprehend why everyone was drooling over Will. If he were a person in reallife i would feel uncomfortable around him, a feeling that i do not enjoy to point that out. He's reckless, dishonest (to himself) and he is too much of an ******* too often. He's too cold for my liking. Halfway through the book i was pretty sure that he was going to truly show his soft side at one point, but guess you can't have everything you want. Like i said, unpredictable. Though, i've still got hope that he will enlighten me as the story goes on. I still have that comment from Sophie in my head: ""There's something dark in him,"" Sophie said. ""Something black and dark that he's hiding . He's got some sort of secret, the kind that eats you up inside."" She sets her silver-haired brush down on the vanity, and Tessa saw with surprise that her hand was shaking. ""You mark my words."" I'm afraid she's right. Then there is Jessamine. I honestly haven't figured out what she contributes to the story that could possibly make her important. Maybe that'll get clearer in the sequels. All in all in found this book pretty enjoyable, especially because of the distinct writing style. I did not get hooked right away, basically it took until Nathaniel appeared in the story for me to develop a real interest in how it continued. Yet, it ended up being a really good book in my memory. I'd recommend it to Fans of The Mortal Instruments, fans of the ******* love interest, Fans of Fantasy, etc. 4.5 stars!",Smalltownbelles
9781406330342,"Clockwork Angel being anticipated to turn out as great as The Mortal Instruments series, does not disappoint. Cassandra Clare achieves to capture the Victorian setting in all its details perfectly. Needing some time to adjust to the unusual combination of a 19th century setting with the, only known as modern, Shadowhunter's adventures, Clockwork Angel turned out being a bomb: silent ticking at the beginning, exploding with an even louder boom! When you don't want to put your novel down for even a few seconds, when dusty attics become magical places and you fall in love with the personality and complexity of each of a novel's characters, it was definitely written by Cassandra Clare! THE VERDICT Clockwork Angel is one of the greatest books of 2010 and just the beginning to a new series with amazing potential. This novel convinces with its originality, complex storyline and unique characters. It's not just about romance, friendship and thrilling secrets, but about a whole new universe of possibilities.

9780141340135,"I didn't expect myself to actually pick up this book. For one, I never really liked the story of the Cinderella and to read a retelling wasn't really going to change my mind about Cinderella. But when I did start reading Cinder. I was excessively surprised when I realized it may have the vague skeleton of 'the Cinderella Plot' but it was a story that took it's own life and originality. Cinder is half-human half-robot aka a cyborg. Cyborgs, in this world, have very little rights and were considered nothing better than slaves. So, Cinder was the mechanic slave of her foster mother. All she does is work at the repair shop her family owns, eats, sleep and frequently get into arguments with her foster mother and her evil foster sister. I know, that sounds very Cinderella. But then the prince of New Beijing appears at her repair shop looking for the best mechanic in the city. He asks Cinder to repair his robot, Nancy. And Cinder manages to make an impression on him. Things escalate and the plague breaks out in the town center close to Cinder's booth, her nicer foster sister gets ill, her foster mother throws a fit and volunteers Cinder to the draft system. The draft system is where cyborgs are sent to become lab rats. They are then injected with the plague then injected again with the latest antidote to the plague to see if it works or not. Most cyborgs don't come out alive. I'm not sure what part of the book I actually liked the most, the hint of romance or the controversies and the dispute between Earth and the Moon. I'm not one for politics but in this book. I just want to get into it so I can find the way to get the crazy and disgusting queen of the moon off the backs of every one on Earth. She is way to manipulative and irritating to just let her be like that. Anyways, I linked Cinder a lot more than later because of her kick-buttery and her strength to keep going even after the only family she knew shunned her and society discriminating her because of her mechanical foot and hand. Having a strong protagonist like her to is one of the best factors a wonderful book needs to have. She was easy to relate to in one small way or another. Overall, I applaud the author for ending the book with the worst cliffhanger ever, and her tenacity to include a little bit of everything for different types of readers out there. If you're a big fan of Cinderella, Science Fiction and Dystopia, you will absolutely love this.",Najla Qamber
9780141340135,"Cinder is an amazing retelling of the Cinderella fairytale (in case that wasn't obvious). I'm not even sure I can explain just how great this book is, I loved it from the first page to the very last. When a story has cyborgs, princes, androids, aliens, a deadly plague that's bound to wipe out the human race, it's bound to be spectacular. Linh Cinder is a strong female character, her problems and insecurities only leading to her becoming even stronger. It's the first time I agree through and through with all of the character's decisions and ways of handling matters. You can also easily connect not just with her, but with the side characters as well. For example, there's a little child who appears briefly in the book, but it's one that definitely leaves an impression. The villain is absolutely fascinating! Queen Levana is an extremely powerful enemy, one that you should never ever cross. The entire Lunar race is so enjoyable to read, from their abilities to their quite large family tree :) There were a lot of plot twists that you could easily predict, however this just makes you want to keep on reading to see how everything unravels. And it wouldn't be Cinderella without a ball, right? That was by far my favorite scene from Cinder, so much was going on that I just couldn't put the book down. *Favorite quotes ""Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time."" ""Prince Kai! Check my fan, I think I'm overheating."" *Rating Characters: 5/5 Main character, side characters, every single person mentioned is amazeballs!! - except Adri, of course - Romance: 4/5 While I absolutely loved it, I wanted much much more (which I'm hoping we'll get in the sequel). Pacing/Length: 4.5/5 Don't get me wrong, the beginning of the book was interesting too, but in the end you were just getting your face slapped with constant action and plot twists and did I say action?! I'm well aware a book can't be all about that - and that's why the beginning was a tiny bit slower - , but the change was so quick that you can tell from where it started to get really good. Cover: 5/5 In love with it. Always have been, always will be. Plot: 5/5 DAMN this story is good.",Ioana Culcea
9780141340135,"Wow. This book was just AMAZING! From the first page to the last, it was gripping, interesting and mind blowing! I know a lot of people who were slightly disappointed, a lot of people who said this book could do without the Cinderella theme and all that, but I thought it perfect! I admit, at first I was reluctant to read Cinder. I don't even know why; it's just that among the many books on my To-Read list, this wasn't the one to pop out when I wondered what book to read. Maybe it was the fact it was a first in a new series, and I rarely read those. I hate the wait, you see. Maybe it was because it had cyborgs and all that, and I haven't read much-if any- of those; hence I didn't know if I'd like the genre or not. Boy, how I'm kicking myself right now over it! I can't believe I didn't read it sooner! Thank god for Goodreads group reads, otherwise it might've taken me ages to get to it! (Though, now I'm kicking myself for reading it because, honestly, how the hell am I supposed to wait until February 2013 for the next book?! And then another year for the next, and another one... I'll lose my mind! This is exactly why I don't do firsts in new series!) THE PlOT Cinder presents itself as a re-telling of Cinderella. In the city of New Beijing, lives Cinder - an orphan, a stepdaughter, and a possession. Her evil stepmother, Adri, treats her as a servant, and everything in the house is left upon her shoulders, while her adopted family spends the money she earns - never giving her a cent. Even when she really needs it. Then there is prince Kai, the crown prince of New Beijing, a figure many girls dream to meet and one day merry. And of course, there is a ball. And a shoe... sort of. Oh, and I forgot to mention: Cinder's a cyborg. No big deal. Yes, Cinderella is part metal, and honestly, calling this book a retelling of Cinderella is underrating it. Cinderella is the theme. But it's not the story. The story is about very deep things, when you think about it - It's about slavery and people-living people with hearts and minds-being treated like possession. Owned. It's about death and its horrific form. It's about dictatorship and its ugly face. And it's about finding yourself among it all. Or starting to, anyway. Besides, there were some striking differences between Cinder and Cinderella, all whom I'm sure you'll notice while reading. I don't want to give up too many details, but the story of Cinderella? You know, the one in which a servant girl desperately wants to go to the ball and dance with a prince, and a fairy comes and-well, you've seen the Disney movie. Well, Cinder has very little to do with that. Cinder is actually about a deadly plague, war threats from the Lunars - humans who live on the moon and long ago stopped being considered humans, and how someone different, not by his own fault, struggles with the difficulties that is his life. Meyer takes the fairytale, makes something entirely different to it and inside puts reference to the story we all know in ways that makes you quirk a smile. THE CHARACTERS The characters in the book were well developed and I found myself very emotionally invested in them. Cinder, heroine of the book and its namesake, is courageous, smart, strong and a little lost. She lives like a possession and wants her freedom, wishing she wasn't what she is. Wishing people would stop recoil or send her disgusted looks when they see her. Kai, prince of New Beijing, is the other main character of the book, who's POV we get to see from the second part of the book on. He's very likable, struggling with the many responsibilities suddenly put on his shoulders. He is sweet, charming and... well - princely? I guess the title ""prince charming"" fits him well. Then we have Adri, the evil stepmother, Pearl, the evil stepsister, Peony, the good stepsister, the Queen and a few more. All were well done and added to the story. I NEARLY CRIED You know a book is good when I nearly cry when it barely started. You know a book is good when in a couple of pages, it makes you so in tune and living the characters, that you cry for their loses. That you weep for their pain. That you pray for their lives. And this book did it. My eyes watered and I felt so sad, and I'm sure you'll know what I'm taking about once you read the book. THE WRITING Let's start with the simple - the writing style is simply engrossing. It sucks you right in, and I don't doubt for a minute that if I weren't busy with college (meaning: barely time to read) I would've finished this book in a single way. And then cried and whined for hours that it was over. Now, what I felt was special about this book was how Meyer made us sweat for information. She keeps us guessing, confused, but not in a bad way in my opinion. And I felt she very much intended to get us all confused. Meyer doesn't explain most of the time - she shows, over the course of the entire book. She lets us see for ourselves, understand without saying the words specifically. She leaves it up to us to gather the information, trusts us to figure it out through the character's actions, words, memories. And it works. You understood most everything, and what we didn't? I trust she'll explain it, in the future books. Meyer does not seem to be in a rush to show her world to us. PREDICTABILItY Yes, this book is predictable. The reader realizes where the big revelation is headed fairy early on, but I don't think Meyer intents for it to be a big secret. She went for something pretty obvious, but the rest of the book is pretty outstanding. We might not be surprised, and yet we are, in a way. Not by the big bad secrets, but by the entire scenario. The entire world. The entire direction taken here. And there there is that ending... ENDING Dear god, what a cliffhanger! Is that seriously where the book ends?! I spoiled it for myself half way though when I went to check when Scarlet comes out, and I don't think I would've seen it coming (I'm not talking about the big secret. I'm talking about what happens to Cinder) without it. It didn't make me any less surprised and anxious to read the ending, though. And now I have to wait. Until 2013. It's only 4 months away. 4... months... I'm going to die.",Nitzan Schwarz
9780141340135,"Reason for Reading: Upon reading the summary, I knew this book was for me as it had everything I'd love in a YA novel: fairytale retelling, sci-fi, cyborg, and dystopia. I had planned not to start any new series this year but I didn't know this was the start of a series until I started to read the book. This was fabulous! I have to admit that when it really boils down to it I do much prefer science fiction to fantasy, and yet I don't read nearly as much of it. This hit the spot perfectly. A fairytale retelling that goes far beyond the scope of the original fairytale. Meyer has managed to hold onto the basic characters and some major events while throwing the familiar plot out the window to bring us a new version of Cinderella that had me glued to my seat and turning pages almost faster than I could read. Cinder is the dominant character in this book and one fantastic female lead who carries the plot all on her own. I took to her character right away and found her to be very well-written, with genuine feelings and emotion. She is a person who stays true to her own nature no matter how it will affect appearances sake. I also found the dystopian world intriguing. Set in some unknown future, a century after World War IV, the world has changed its political divisions and ruling systems, is different in many ways and yet not so much that it is still a believable possible reality. The book ends looking forwards to the sequel and yet has a satisfying ending for the book in hand. Something I appreciate in series books. One of my favourite reads this year.",Nicola Mansfield
9780141340135,"After all of the hype that Cinder has received in the past couple of months, I was so happy to finally have a copy in my hands! I loved both the cover and the premise and, thankfully, it certainly lived up to my expectations. This is a retelling of the classic Cinderella, and it is very loosely based around the idea with some parallels. The book starts with a quote from the original version, but we can tell that this is a very different setting and story from the first paragraph. This story is set in New Beijing, which I thought was original and effective. Often a lot of Young Adult books are set in America or England, so this was a refreshing change. It was interesting to have a story set in a very different cultural background and to see the different aspects of society. We are also introduced to the Lunars - a very interesting society, based on the moon and led by the power-hungry Queen Levana, who is very hostile towards the Earthen. There was also some mentions of 'Princess Winter' of Luna, who I believe we will be seeing in the last novel of this series - and I can't wait! Cinder, as our main character, was fantastic. I really loved reading about her and she was fantastically formed. Cinder is a cyborg and a mechanic. She is not a 'girly girl' - most of the time she is walking around in her combat trousers which are covered in oil and grease. She is certainly her own person, with a strong determined personality which isn't easily swayed by others. She had a very real attitude, which is what I loved about her. Of course, she had an evil stepmother called Adri and whom I really disliked, but liked as a villain - she was cruel and spiteful. I actually didn't mind one of her step-sisters, Peony, as their relationship did change and was quite sentimental at points. However, her other was a great reflection of her mother, with a very cruel streak to her. Prince Kai was our second prominent character in this novel, and I can see why he had such a fan base! From the very first encounter we had with him, he was a likeable character. He didn't give much away and he was very intriguing. Although he is a handsome prince, Kai is not perfect and this is why he is so loveable. He is realistic in his emotions - he gets scared, but he also has confidence and can be brave. The romance between Cinder and Prince Kai was not instant, but the chemistry built throughout the book, which I really enjoyed. There was also quite some subtle humour thrown in by Kai, which lightened the tone of the story. The whole sci-fi aspect of this book was fascinating. There were some great descriptions of mechanics, especially when considering androids - robots which worked with and around the people of New Beijing. Iko, Cinder's android, confidante and friend was very fun to read about and it was surprisingly easy to build an emotional connection to her, even if she was completely made of metal. A lot of morality issues are discussed in this book and a lot of questions regard personality versus body or shell. Cyborgs and androids are classed as second class citizens in this new world. Cinder discovers more about herself as the novel progresses and faces a lot of internal battles. There was, somewhat, a sense of mystery to this novel, but unfortunately I found it to be quite predictable and knew what the outcome was going to be around the first quarter of this novel. However, it was still interesting to see how things unfolded and how facts were brought together. The ending was quite a cliffhanger which was disappointing to me as things weren't completely resolved. It's not very clear whether this will be resolved in the next novel, as I believe it focuses on a different character, but I'd like to hope there will be some sort of closure to the story. Overall, whilst this novel wasn't completely perfect, it was interesting and engaging. I loved the idea of it and thought that the execution was well done. I never thought that a book that was so heavily based around androids and cyborgs would capture my attention as well as this one did. With it's feisty heroine, atypical romance and fantastic idea, this is a book that I'd certainly recommend. I can not wait to read the next instalment to see what Meyer has to offer us next!",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9781416995593,"WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SUMMER is more mature than the previous two novels in the SUMMER series, the characters are grown up now and we get the chance to read about their college life. Everything seems different, Cousins isn't a constant stay for summers anymore. In some ways characters moved on, built up their own lives, but they are still unconsciously circling around the same summer house, the memories of past summers and the same feelings that were suppressed or awakened so many years ago. Belly isn't the girl who was surprised to be pretty and noticed anymore. I really enjoyed reading about her college life and new relationships. I liked seeing her as a young woman planning her future. She is as lovely as always, the only thing that bothered me was her denial, that she wouldn't trust her true feelings because she could get hurt. As in book one and two the story is told from Belly's point of view. In this last instalment the elder Fisher brother, Conrad also gets to tell some parts of the story from his perspective. In the two previous books he has been an obscure, brooding character and it was my biggest pleasure to finally read about his thoughts and feelings. Former incidents and statements become clearer, his behaviour more comprehensible, which makes him only more appealing. We also get to witness another side of younger Fisher brother Jeremiah. His actual behaviour shows that people change, no-one ever stays the way he was. WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SUMMER adds further characters to our beloved character cast and develops relationships in a more reasonable way, sometimes at cost of personal admissions, true feelings and happiness. Of course I got teary, in the end, I didn't want this series to end! The end was rash, decisions and confessions were made that led to a satisfying end. It was a pleasing end, but offered too few details. THE VERDICT I give it 4,5/5 stars. Feel the summer spirit of Cousins one last time. See Belly, Jeremiah and Conrad define their future lives and be prepared for a great showdown! WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SUMMER is the last book in the SUMMER series and definitely a must-read!",MissPageTurner
9780786851973,"Ned Vizzini has a distinct advantage over other authors who write about teen depression, attempted suicide, and the ins and outs of psychiatry--as a teen he was clinically depressed and even spent time in a psychiatric hospital. That experience has allowed Mr. Vizzini to bring to life the kinds of situations that were once largely absent in teen fiction; that of the fact that not all teens are happy, spontaneous, happy-go-lucky youths. For Craig Gilner, gaining acceptance into the elite Executive Pre-Professional High School in Manhattan is not the end of his problems, but only the beginning. All the studying, the cramming, the all-nighters he pulled to get high marks in his old high school and ace his entrance exam now seem mediocre, at best, at his new school. Craig realizes quite early on that he's not brilliant, he's not at the top of his class--he is, in fact, average. For a guy who worked as hard as Craig did, with such obsessive determination, this is a blow not just to his ego, but to his very soul. Craig soon finds himself unable to eat, unable to sleep, unable to find joy in just about everything. As he realizes he's clinically depressed, he tells his shrink--excuse me, psychiatrist--that his only joy in life comes from peeing. Yes, peeing. You go in, you get it done, you accomplish what you set out to do, and you're finished. It's pretty sad that going to the bathroom seems to be the highlight of his day (he even manages to stretch each trip out to about five minutes), but it's also the truth. Dr. Minerva, for $120/hour, is attempting to help Craig figure out exactly why he's depressed and how to overcome it. But Craig no longer thrives on a life of complexity; for him, life is a nightmare. And as his depression leads to thoughts of suicide, he's not even surprised to find that there's an 800 number he can call. And after taking the plunge and calling 1-800-SUICIDE Craig hikes over to the local emergency room at the hospital, where he meets Dr. Mahmoud (who is not a terrorist). From there, Craig is checked into a psychiatric hospital, and he meets a motley crew of patients who, amazingly enough, become better friends to him than the ones he had before he went in ever were. For Craig, being in the hospital might just save not only his life, but his sanity and his will to keep on keeping on. IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY is a great read. Filled with issues that plague a large number of teens today, the author has managed to take sensitive topics and deal with them in a humorous way that never seems disrespectful. A very enjoyable, thought-provoking read.",TeensReadToo
9781909531192,"I read this book a good few years back and when I stumbled upon it again I really wanted to reread it. There isn't too much I can say on this book without spoiling it. At the age of eleven when I read it and knew minimum things about the topic of this book I was intrigued and wanted to find out more. Now, at the age of fifteen and knowing a lot more about it, it was a read that still very much intrigued me and haunts me. The book has an atmosphere throughout the book that constantly has you on edge. It creates this place in Bruno?C/??s mind where you only understand things in the way of a nine year old boy and the way he is handling the changes that are going on in his life. His character, I think, would portray any younger person that was in his situation. From the curiosity he has about the world around him, to the way he tries to cope with his family and other people around him. An extremely well thought out book that constantly makes you question what is going on. Boyne gives you no clues as to what is going to happen next and every page ends up a new adventure in the world of Bruno. You slowly start to latch onto what the book is about the same time he does, you feel the exact same things Bruno feels. A heart breaking book that will always have me in tears but always makes me remember that the events of this book had happened.",Saira Ahmed
9780525478812,"Chrissy's 5-star review Did I enjoy this book: This is one of those books that I have been wanting to read for quite some time. I am so glad that I took the time to read it. It was unexpected. I heard a lot of great things about this book, and I was worried that I wouldn't like it or that it wouldn't live up to the hype. This book was as good as everyone had said. It lived up to the hype. Okay, let's get into the book. I thought The Fault In Our Stars was very real, gritty. I couldn't imagine being that age and facing my own mortality. The kids-Hazel, Augustus, Isaac-they didn't sugarcoat anything. They were real, bitter, upset, trying to fight. I enjoyed that. It made me connect because it seemed more true. I rooted for them throughout the book. It wasn't rooting for a longer life, although that was part of it. I was rooting that they got the chance to live life. As I was reading, I did something that I hardly ever-more like never-do, I skipped ahead. I read parts and found out what was going to happen. Not because I didn't know what was going to happen, but because I wanted to be prepared for it. Not that you can ever truly be prepared for death and dying. I just needed to know ahead of time. Seriously, I don't do that. When the final Harry Potter book was released, I avoided the news, internet, people, etc. until I read it. I like to be surprised by books. I like to find out the story as it unfolds. With The Fault In Our Stars, I couldn't wait. I had to know. This book isn't all sad all the time. It is romantic; it is sweet. There were a lot of wonderful laugh out loud moments. This surprised me, but didn't. I would think that when you are going through something like this, you would need to find something humorous. Something to make you laugh. I loved Hazel's friend Kaitlyn's line about Thin Mints. That cracked me up. The egging was hysterical, especially when the mother came out of the house. These are the words that sum up The Fault In Our Stars for me: real, funny, sad, thoughtful, sweet, romantic, angry, tragic. This is a book that I will probably read again. Would I recommend it: Yes. Belinda's 5-star review Did I enjoy this book: Yes. Amazon recommended it to me based on my reading choices. It looked interesting so I bought it. It's kind of creepy how well Amazon knows my taste in books. The Fault In Our Stars is a beautiful and poignant story of teens battling cancer. It's the kind of book where the bad guys win in the struggle between teen vs. cancer. It's a sad book but one worth reading. Green takes you on the journey with Hazel and Gus. Like all teens they're trying to see where they belong in this world. Unfortunately, they also know that they won't belong in this world for very long. Fortunately for us, they made a strong impression for the short time we spend with them. There's a quote at the end of the novel that I love. Fearing he's losing Hazel to illness, Gus said, "" . . . you don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers."" It gives me goose bumps every time I read it. There's nothing like youth and tragedy to make a novel sparkle. Well done, John Green. Would I recommend it: Absolutely.",Chrissy
9780525478812,"Originally published at http://thebooklifeforme.blogspot.co.uk/ Words cannot even begin to describe how this novel made me feel. Never has the written word imbibed such deep emotions within me. Indeed, never has a novel made me think so much. About the sanctity life, of my own morality, and on other notes, of how unjustifiably unfair life really is. The Fault in Our Stars follows the prose of Hazel Grace Lancaster, the protagonist, who is suffering from late stage thyroid cancer, and has to walk around with an oxygen tank in order to breathe properly. She meets Augustus, sufferer of Osteosarcoma, who fears oblivion, and Isaac, who has eye cancer, at a support group for cancer sufferers. Aptly nicknamed the Literal Heart of Jesus. Augustus, we find out from the start, is highly intelligent and passionate and just a generally beautiful human being. He holds an unlit cigarette in his mouth as a symbol of defiance, a way of winning against the cancer. He says it's holding the cancer causing object in his mouth, without giving it the power to give him, by lighting it. (Please excuse my inadequate response of a beautiful, beautiful character). What makes Gus so loveable, so amazing is that he is human. he's brave and intelligent and beautiful, yes, but he's also scared, scared of Oblivion, as he tells Hazel Grace. As most stories go, they fall in love. But their love is so pure, so untainted. Death surprisingly, was not the main objective of this book. As one would think when reading novels that deal so heavily with sickness and morality. The book centers around the romance between Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, a character to whom many have fallen in love with. John Greens flawless prose and philosophical speech help you to really get a feel for the characters, to fall in love with them, cry for them. I root for them, and just want them to get better, to fight the disease that slowly kills them. But John is pretty clear from the start, their fate is sealed from the first turn of the page. Although this is aimed at teenagers/young adults. The strong writing and delicate prose, is ideal for an older audience too. Anyone can enjoy the beauty of Johns writing and fall in love with his characters. This is a piece of literary masterpiece that will stay with you forever. Whether you like it or not. So many times I cried, I laughed and I turned the pages feverishly, inspired to get to the last page. To find out the fates of his characters. And yet as the fate became grimmer, more darker, I was spurred to read on. I could say so many things, so many empty words. But they all pale into significance, along with that blinking cursor as I try to form an appropriate diatribe. Because, never, in such a long time have I cared so deeply for characters. or a book in my life. And this is one novel that I will carry with me forever.",Miranda Smith
9780525478812,"originally published at www.youtube.com/bookswithclaire Amazing book, didn't think I would like it so much! I ended up really loving this book, although it was a bit sad and didn't see the end coming. The book is about a girl called Hazel. She meets a very handsome boy called Augustus at a cancer support group. He immediatly falls for her and she quite likes him too. They both like reading and Hazel recommended him one. When he also liked it he Decides to give his genie wish to Hazel because she loves the book so much. The writer was a Dutch man and that's why they travel to Amsterdam. There they meet the writer and go visit museums and have dinner. they even like each other more and more. At the end of the trip Hazel sees something different on augustus. He is in pain. when she tells him she sees that he tells her his cancer got worse. they go home and there it becomes more worse. He dies about a month later. having left a letter to the Dutch writer for Hazel. that is how the book ends. it was so sad and cried so much. most of all because i'm in the situation myself. I see someone having cancer and I'm not able to do something about it. It's getting worse and worse and it hurts to see someone have so much pain. Hazel and Augustus showed me how it feels and what you can do. Thank you John Green for writing this book and thank you for being such a great author!",Marie-Claire

There were hilarious times and there were times were I had to stop reading so as to wipe the flooding tears from my eyes just so I could continue without my blurry vision. No book has ever left such mark on me like this book has. I saw John's personality a lot while reading (I watch his youtube videos).

If you're a more blood/politics people then don't try this book, no matter how much everyone tells you to read it, because you won't like it and you'll talk crap about it, and this book deserves better. I don't think its the best book ever, I don't usually read this kind of books because they're romantic and stuff, but I decided to read it because (I wanted to be popular?) everyone was talking about it and I was curious. I liked it, even though I'm not a romance person. It wasn't that romantic, and the ending...I definitely didn't see that coming, maybe that's why I liked it (and cried) so much.

Yes, I am a chick who despises 'chick flicks', 'romantic literature' etc. The only romantic book I ever really loved was 'Villette'. So, this book. Like the majority of 'New York Times Best Sellers', I was so bored with the writing, that I didn't finish the first chapter. Didn't care for what I had read of the story so far either. I gave it a one for my personal preference, but I'm sure it's at least a three if you like that stuff. I wouldn't give it more than that, because the quality of the writing, (as far as I went with it), didn't seem all that crash hot to me. If you are like my friend Ange, and love soppy stories, you will like this. If you thought 'Love Story', was great, (Ange did!), you will love this. I like strategy, battles, blood, mud, and politics, so it isn't any wonder I was bored. There were no blood soaked berserkers or crumbling galactic empires on the first few pages, so no wonder I wasn't gripped. Give me a clean death by the sword any day, over all this angst-ing. I'd just been reading Arthur Cheney Train's old lawyering stories, so it's no wonder this looked bad in comparison anyway.

With books that end up with as much hype as The Hunger Games has, it's always a concern of mine that it won't live up to the praise, but Collins absolutely delivers with this one.

9781407109084,"The story is told from Katniss' point of view who has lived through many losses and deprivations, always knowing about the omnipresent danger of death. Her clear line of thoughts and rational analysis of situations are combined with flashbacks and personal memories. When it comes to the ones she loves, Katniss can't but fight what makes her the touch heroine we always wanted to read about. She is a very likeable protagonist because she is wild, loyal and true to her heart. Our male protagonist Peeta, a quiet and inconspicuous character in the beginning, grows to new strengths in the arena. It is Katniss' physical strength and her rational analysis and Peeta's empathy and big heart that make them a perfect team. I really enjoyed reading about Katniss and Peeta growing into a team while the other districts mostly fighting on their own, never trusting anyone. We are bound to district twelve, the home of our protagonists Peeta and Katniss and although we like them so much together, we already know there will only be one winner. One would think there is not a single second to give love room in an arena of death, but what would you say if allowing love and emotions was the only way to survive? The idea of a world that is dominated by a small group of superiors, playing with the life of humans so easily is unbelievably cruel and abhorrent. Suzanne Collins created a dystopian novel that doesn't let you rest till the last page is turned, like you were in a race to win the Hunger Games yourself, never able to stop. Despite its cruelty the Hunger Games appear as a fantastic idea and major element to produce a new kind of YA novel. The thrill of the enemies getting closer, never knowing their exact position, always hiding, fighting supernatural powers and feeling the need to survive that must run through our protagonist, seems to be passed on to me and I couldn't wait to know what happens next. The Hunger Games is told from a first person narrator and is written in present tense. I usually prefer stories written in past tense, but for The Hunger Games present tense works perfectly. The applied present tense expresses the unstoppability of current events. Like Katniss herself, I never knew what to expect next. A fight of life or death is best told from the present tense, the moment it's happening to realize its significance and danger at the same time. So beside the overall more than thrilling storyline, this element of writing style contributes to establishing a highly successful novel. 24 tributes, 12 districts, 2 lovers and only 1 victor. In a fight of life or death, there is no way to slow down. The Hunger Games had me up all night. THE VERDICT Everybody enjoys a game with a good bet, so how could you resist a game as grand as The Hunger Games, a game with the most precious bet there could be- your life? Don't hesitate and join Katniss and Peeta in their battle against death and human nature itself! Start reading The Hunger Games and feel the adrenaline rushing through your body in unit with this electrifying novel!",MissPageTurner

9780375842207,"How does a person review a book that is so beautiful, and yet contains such horrible language that I would now shudder to even mention the book to anyone? 1 star it is. The premise of 'The Book Thief' lures you in. It's a story told from the persona of Death during WWII. Piece by piece, the story of Liesel Meminger comes together, as revealed by Death. ""It's just a small story, really, about, among other things: - A girl - Some words - An accordionist - Some fanatical Germans - A Jewish fist fighter - And quite a lot of thievery"" Yes, it's a book to quote from. The author's writing style is definitely unique. Everyone will find that particular sentence which tingles inside of them. Actually, it's a story hidden within poetic prose. The poignancy and heartfelt emotion hold time still while you read. Sometimes the writer takes a moment away from the storyline to create an announcement to the reader --- just a bonus sentence in the page's middle, set off from the other paragraphs, to describe the scene in a more direct way. It's a fascinating writing style, but, Mr. Zusak, did you have to include such filthy words? Eye-opening in several areas, the book marches you through WWII right alongside Liesel and her foster family, after she loses her own. I must say that most books concerning WWII are always from the point of view of the Jews, the persecuted, or the other sympathetic allies. However, this story reveals itself from the perspective of the everyday German families who were hurt by their own countrymen. What heartbreak they experienced around them, forced on by their Nazi neighbors. As reflected in the title of the book, there is something to be gained by the power of words. Liesel finds that power within herself, and she aims to do something with that growing ability. I wish I could read it all over again, minus about a tenth of the book to remove the worst of the rotten language.",Tarissa

I mean, seriously? The book hadn?C/C/?!C/?C/t even officially started yet and I was moved to tears. It could have been the subject matter of the story but, more than likely, it was the words that were used to tell that story. Because, if nothing else, Markus Zusak schools you in the power of words.

To Save. ?C/C/?!??I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.?C/C/?!?? The Book Thief is the story of a young girl growing up in Nazi Germany.

You know every facet of their everyday lives: their worries, their hopes, their fears.

9780375842207,"This book was recommended to me as a fine historical novel. I honestly had no idea what to expect except that it was WWII Germany. From the beginning, I was enraptured like I have not been in a very long time. Imagine having Death narrate the book and actually feel sorry for him! And the writing style was very reminiscent of classic literature. The author writes fantastic prose in a way few authors can in this post-modern era. The characters were drawn in such a rich way. Death's grim humor and genuine concern for humanity caused the book to touch my emotions in a way most books cannot. I guess I shall never tire of WWII stories. It is a period of history that repulses and intrigues me. Although this is fiction, I truly found myself caring about the characters. Death's continued foreshadowing of events to come were always executed at exactly the right time. I think this book can touch anyone who decides to read it. it does have some foul language, but I found that every use of it made sense. There were no sex scenes nor descriptive violence, but the book is harsh and real. Violence is there and unfortunately quite necessary.",Ruth Hill
9780375842207,"I finished The Book Thief a long time ago, but I kept postponing the review because, honestly, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to write. Has it ever happened to you to read a book and be so utterly stunned at the end that you first needed to stare into space for a couple of minutes to take it all in, and then found yourself incapable of explaining how, why... what had just happened? I can't say many books did this to me. I'm sure I can count them on the fingers of one hand, but The Book Thief sure did it for all the books out there. How do you even begin to review such a book? I can't say I loved it; it would be far from enough to explain how I really felt about it. I can't say I adored it, or that I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know (because I won't), or that it was the best thing I have ever read (I'm not sure it was). I sound confused, right? Well, let's see if I can explain. I'll never say that I loved or adored The Book Thief because the words that would help me define how this book made me feel have yet to be invented. When I started reading it I genuinely didn't know what to expect. Well, yes, I might have had some expectations because I knew I was about to read a bestseller that would be soon turned into a film, but still, I was quite innocent about it. After the first couple of pages I understood two things: 1. It was not going to be a book that I'd recommend to many people. 2. I would probably read it for the writing style rather than for its story. Why not recommend it? Because the style is highly metaphorical and experimental; it is an entanglement of figures of speech, abstract ideas, dry humor, and preciousness that would normally make me cringe in a book. But not in this book. No, in The Book Thief precious writing works just fine. So fine, that I often felt compelled to draw out a notebook and note down entire quotes, or even paragraphs. But they don't make sense if you take them out of their context; they lose their magic. I guess they belong to the book thief alone. In my experience as a reader who has studied Comparative Literature for five years, I know that not everyone will enjoy this kind of writing. The book starts off slow, the narrator takes her time (I'm going to say her because the narrator is Death and this Death seemed very feminine to me), she builds up the story so slowly and smoothly, as if she had all the time in the world to tell it to the reader. Of course she does, she's Death. She talks about colors, about her job; when you finally think Liesel's story has picked up a bit and is going somewhere, Death makes an invasive comment just to remind you that she's there, in case you forgot. Reading some reviews of The Book Thief on Goodreads, I saw that many people found Death's seemingly random interventions annoying, and some complained that the story is a bit jumpy. No way am I going to complain about these devices. Actually, I'm not going to complain about anything. I found the writing style perfect, and I practically savored each and every word. When my friend (who had lent me the book) asked me what I thought about it, the first thing I said was: ""This is real writing. I haven't read something like this in a long time and I'm just realizing how much I've missed it. Read it for the writing!"" Now, maybe I should say that at some point I continued to read The Book Thief for the characters and the story, but the truth is that I have read this story one too many times in other novels dealing with World War II. I did read it for the characters because the author managed to make them so painfully real that there were times when I wished I had my own Max in the basement so I could properly take care of him, feed him and set him free because, God, did that poor boy suffer in the book. Why can't we just take characters out of their paper cages and give them the life they deserve? But, most of all, I continued to read The Book Thief for how much the second half of the book made me cry. Seriously, I was a complete mess. There were at least two scenes during which I cried so hard that I couldn't follow the lines anymore, and it got annoying because I just had to continue reading. But no, I had to take a break to rub my eyes and blow my nose. Pathetic... It's unbelievable what some books can do to us, mortals. And it's not like I didn't know what would happen, because if there's something that Death is not good at, that's building up suspense. No, she tells you what's going to happen pages ahead. Still, when I got to that point in the novel, I was still shocked and needed time to process the information. And now I get to another device that not many authors can pull off: ditching the mystery in favor of simply telling you how it's all going to end, and still being able to keep you hooked until the last word. About that last word... I was staring at it as if that could make more words appear on the page. Anyway, thank God I live alone, because if I still lived with my parents and any of them had walked into the room and saw the state I was in and asked me ""What happened?"" I would've probably answered ""What do you mean what happened? The Book Thief happened. This guy... this Zusak guy just made me cry so hard... I wanna marry him."" Bottom line: I'm going to re-read The Book Thief until I learn entire chunks of it by heart.",Oana

I appreciated that the book painted a picture of probably a very normal household in the second world war.

Since I didn't review the first two books, I wasn't going to review this one either, but then I thought about it, and decided that it's not up for discussion. I DO have to review Isla to make up for not reviewing the previous two books and telling everyone about the most amazing books ever (okay, most amazing books ever after Harry Potter). If there is still a person who hasn't read Anna and Lola, I suggest you not to waste time on reading my review, but go and pick up yourself a copy of Anna and the French Kiss and read the awesomeness! Than you can come back and thank me later for making you read these books! Stephanie Perkins is a very special author for me. She's one of the very few whose books I can read whenever I don't feel like reading and they'd make me feel better. When I'm reading one of her books I just get that happily ever after feeling. Everything feels better. Her characters, her adorable stories, everything just makes you happy. Isla and the Happily Ever After is a little bit different than Anna and Lola. While in the first two books we had to wait until the end for them to figure out their feelings and kiss, Isla and Josh are pretty straight forward. They admit their feelings pretty fast, and from there, we get to read about the most adorable relationship ever. Until . . . the insecurities come in. Isla is insecure about many things. She's not sure what does she want of her future, and when she has to spend some time apart from Josh, she starts doubting him and their relationship. This wasn't my favorite part of the book, but it made to book seem more realistic. We get the feeling that they're an actual couple, and not some imaginary couple made up in heaven. But speaking of favorite moments, there was a LOT of them, but if I have to pick one, it's when Anna & St.Clair and Lola & Cricket made an appearance in the book. I was sooo happy to see them again and to get some kind of closure in the end. We have the cutest couple, the most romantic city in the world, amazingly adorkable story, and probably one of the best authors - which means, yes, I'd recommend this book!",Anatea
9781409581130,"The perfect ending to one of the most amazing series I have read in a while. It was so good, I just couldn't put it down! We briefly met Isla in 'Anna and the French Kiss', and now we get to see her senior year at SOAP unfold. Cue Josh, Rashmi's ex from Anna, and their love story evolves quickly with Paris, New York, Barcelona and Washington all significant. Kurt, Isla's best friend, is a great new character and a quiet favourite of the book. He is protective of his best friend, with the usual debate about friend vs boyfriend and how much time you are spending with each of them apparent at points. St. Clair, Anna, Lola, Cricket and Meredith return with one of the best surprises of all occurring at the end, in a significant spot. I could not contain the happy feels!! I love how Perkins' writes, and these books will be read by me, and my friends, for years to come. I just wish they were movies!",Hannah Clark
9781409581130,"The third and final book on this companion novels trilogy, it feels great to finally read some more of Stephanie Perkins work. In Isla, we get to see more of Paris, giving us a warm feeling from Anna, when we got to know about SOAP and have the first glances of Isla and Josh. But we get more than Paris, we get to see a bit of New York and Barcelona - now Ia??m the way I was when I finish the first book, dying to meet Paris, but also Barcelona, and wanting to go back to NYC so badly. One of my favorite things on Perkinsa?? books is that we can see that they characters have flaws, theya??re not always perfect and you dona??t always love them. But you want to follow their development as people, because they feel real. Each character has their own voice, Anna, Lola and Isla are very unique, each one of them have their own way to show their emotions, to tell their stories. Kurt is an amazing character and I really wish I got to know him better, but it wasna??t a book about his life. Their friendship was written as a friendship is: with high and lows, but one always being there for the other. Ita??s not a perfect book, sometimes I felt like a lot was happening at the same time and too fast, but it didna??t ruin anything for me and I cana??t wait to marathon the three books and to love every bit of them all over again.",Bells C.
9781409120544,"Plot: The plot has the makings of a John Green hit. I wondered for a moment if it could be the next The Fault in Our Stars; a story dealing with real issues in a non-paranormal world. So, does it hold a light to John Green? No. The story has the potential to really push the domestic abuse to the limit but I kind of feel like Rowell just glosses over it. Ita??s always hovering in the background but ita??s never tackled head-on. The love story motif isna??t enough to carry the plot. Eleanora??s and Parka??s initial meeting is sweet but there needs to be another element or the domestic abuse needs to be dealt with because the plot is flat. I was satisfied with the ending but I felt like Rowell could have worked harder in the beginning and middle parts to make me empathise with her characters. 8/20 Narration: The narration is third-person but focuses in on Eleanor and Park. Ita??s extremely clinical to the point where I dona??t warm to either character. Each voice should be distinctive but instead, therea??s nothing to distinguish them. They read the exact same. For dual voices to work, both characters need to have different lexicons, different ways of seeing things and different thought processes. I dona??t get that here and a lot of the time, Rowell uses words that undercut the language associated with each character. A perfect example is when Eleanor cana??t help but look at Park with a??gooey eyesa??. 6/20 Character: The characters are as flat as my Mama??s (for Americans = Moma??s and for Brits = Muma??s) pancakes. Mr. Stessman is an inconsistent character. Parka??s Mom comes off a bit stereotypical and one-dimensional at times. I like Eleanor. Shea??s the only character where I feel like the reader might almost connect to. 7/20 Quality of Writing: While I think the writing quality is average, there are some things I like such as the comic book back-drop and references (Mr. Fantasic/The Invisible Woman/The Hulk) throughout the story. It reinforces and reminds you of their common interest and always draws it back to how they started out. Having said that, therea??s nothing spectacular about the writing. Rowell has a tendency to tell us everything. The control of information needs to be more gradual as the reader wona??t read on if they feel like they know everything about the book in the first few chapters. 10/20 Setting: Therea??s enough detail for me to get a picture of where I am but it lacks that personal touch that the author usually bring to the world they create. 8/10 Comparative Literature: Ia??ve read some pretty great love stories a?? both paranormal and non-paranormal. Eleanor and Park ranks at the lower end of the scale. It contributes nothing new to the genre and to love stories in YA. John Green in The Fault in Our Stars shows us a terminally ill girl and how everyone can love and be loved. Will Grayson, Will Grayson shows us two very different Willa??s and everything thereafter is somewhat serendipitous. Eleanor and Park, on the other hand, left me with a sense of triumph when I turned the last page because I wanted to give up at pretty much the end of each chapter. 3/10 Overall Score: 42/100 For more reviews, check out: http://youngadultblookclub.wordpress.com/",Christopher Moore
9781409120544,"I bought this book not knowing if it was going to be all that, but then I started to read it. I loved it. It's so good to have a character in the book that's not seen as 'skinny' or 'perfect'. Instead that characters in this book have flaws and insecurities and that's what makes it such an amazing book. it's definitely a new favourite book of mine.",Saraa
9781409120544,"Cute and light and romantic. Beautiful and bittersweet and heart-wrenching. Eleanor & Park is one of the best contemporaries I've read. Ever. I love that the characters are so unique, but in some ways so alike. They're both awkward and smart and funny. I've never encountered such characters like Eleanor and Park before. Eleanor reminds me of Stargirl (in terms of weirdness), only ten times better because she's fat and a red-head. (I dig red-heads.) And she's a strong heroine. Her home life is chaotic, she's being bullied; heck, she doesn't even own a toothbrush. But she takes it all in stride. She may be ashamed of it all but she held on for as long as she could. Park, on the other hand, is this cute, quiet, half-Korean boy who reads comic books and gives bus seats to weird new girls. He's so sweet and it really amazes me that he's totally in love with Eleanor. And boy, does he make me swoon. *Insert heart-shaped eyes and wistful sigh here* Eleanor & Park seems like a light read but the story actually sneaks up on you and pokes at your heart. Rainbow Rowell did a great job in balancing the light and romantic with the serious and heavy parts of the book. The lines are very good, too. They are funny and witty, but there are poignant and gut-wrenching ones, too. I don't know what to think of the ending, though. It's like Stargirl all over again. I only wish there's a sequel because I can't get enough of Eleanor and Park. (Especially Park.) This book is brilliant. A new favorite. Read it. NOW.",Julie Rimpula
9781409120544,"Park instantly thinks of Eleanor as odd. Eleanor considers Park to be rude. And yet somehow over the course they go from being uncomfortable strangers sharing a seat on the school bus to being the centre of the other's universe. For me, books set in the not-so-distant past are often hit or miss. Eleanor and Park is a hit. Rainbow Rowell has a way of mentioning past events, pop-culture references and the way life was in the eighties that instantly felt authentic. Park with his comic books and cassette playing walkman is a kid who doesn't fit in because he's half-Korean but no one can touch because he's schooled in martial arts. With her eccentric outfits and crazy hair, Eleanor is misunderstood. This book deals with some tough issues - Eleanor's home life is troubled - and I liked how Rainbow dealt with those. I loved the contrast between Eleanor and Park in nearly every aspect of their lives. The progression of their relationship was beautiful and different. It's a gradual progression where I felt like both parties were perfect for the other. The supporting characters are strong but didn't leave a lasting impact however they did a good job of carrying the plot along. I think that Eleanor and Park will appeal to fans of quirky romances with tough issues. The setting adds to the plot and the music references just add to the enjoyment of the book.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9781406307641,"The story itself was an interesting concept, but the writing techniques were flawed. Halfway through the author changes writing style and than back again making the flow of the book seem choppy. The characters, felt to me stereotyped and weak. I would strongly suggest that parents read before giving to young children as it describes and incestous relationship bewteen the main character and her brother. Its flaws aside the book is fast paced and won't leave a reader bored. I'd recomend for a mature teenager who only reads a few books a year and not an avid reader.",Serena
9781406307641,As I said in my last review this book has a lot more twists and turns and by far the biggest twist is at the end. this book is my favorite book out of the series it took me 4 days to read the whole book.

From the moment you pick this book up, the action begins, picking up where it left off in the second book. Once coming to a complete circle, you will feel totally and utterly satisfied with the way the book is finished. Lots of action, suspence and mind boggling questions; are they or aren't they? Leave you wondering and guessing what's going to happen throughout the next pages. It's nothing short of thrilling and wonderful. The only let down, is not having enough time with the two love birds once they're together. But I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of them in the coming novel.",Amanda

When i first ordered these books i thought that the book covers would be shiny but they aren't, they are what I would call matte. Which is definitely better, it was totally worth the price. The only thing that annoys me is that because these books are printed in america the first book is 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone' instead of 'Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone' I still don't understand why the Americans had to change it since calling it the philosopher's stone makes more sense, but anyway what can you do?

9781406330335,"I was missing Jace and Clary so much I had to pick this book up after it sitting on my shelf since Christmas. I had pledged to ready only author's I'd never read before in January, and after the month was over I had already moved past all my feels about the first three Mortal Instrument's books. Now I'm really glad I waited and could experience this lovely Shadowhunter world again. Revisiting a familiar fictional world is like coming home, comfortable and fabulous I almost gave this book four stars. It really wasn't as good as the first three, mainly because it was so chaotic. I felt like I was reading the Simon show. I understand that there are more characters than just Jace and Clary, so I am probably biased, but I really did get bored with so much Simon drama. The emotions Jace and Clary went through felt a bit forced, as if there really wasn't anything for Cassandra to create to cause issues with them so she just came up with whatever was easy. I didn't feel their 'troubles' were realistic, even though Shadowhunter's are fictional, the situation just wasn't as believable for that type of setting that it was in the previous books. I know it all tied in together in the end and made sense, I just felt like there could have been a better plot line for that particular section of the book. I was intrigued by the bits of information we learned about some of the other characters, Magnus and Maia. Their pasts were discussed and elaborated on, but I felt like there could have been a little more information provided. I know that there is going to be a Bane Chronicles to give us the information on Magnus as well. I haven't read The Infernal Devices yet, so I don't know if he's in those. The thing about Cassandra Clare's writing style is that it's so easy to read. It flows beautifully and you can speed through her books without feeling like you were cheated. Her writing always leaves me wanting more. We also get a glimpse of what I like to call #TeamMalec. I always get a bit fangirl over any ""Malec"" information and again, I wanted more :) Plot wise, it was all over the place. It felt like riding a roller coaster, there were so many twists and turns. New bad guys, or should I say bad girls, were introduced and a reappearance of a former menace within the last few pages left a cliff hanger so intense that I almost ran to my room and picked up the last book immediately. I had to contain myself because I want to read other books, but I really cannot wait to pick up the next one. All in all this was a magnificent addition to the series. Rating: 5 out of 5 stars, but again, I'm biased for anything Jace/Clary and #TeamMalec Recommendation: I suggest you read this one immediately. If you've read the first three, then keep on trucking partner because this one will not disappoint. It's not the best of the series, but it's really not bad either.",Whytnee shattuck

9781908435132,"When i first heard of this book i had no idea that i would like it so much. In the beginning, i found this book a little slow, but as the world began to come together, i couldn't put it down! It is about a boy named Thomas, who comes up The Box to a place called The Glade. He has no memories other then his name, and soon finds out that he is trapped in the middle of The Maze. As the story goes on, the characters try to figure out a way out, who sent them here and who they really are. This take on the dystopian genre is gripping and suspenseful! I loved the amount of detail that the author used, as it gives a great image in mind of the scene. The characters in the book i either loved or hated, and it gave me a great connection with the story. It is one of my favourites without a doubt! Recommended to 12+",Karina

I was able to read it within 3 days and I was completely captivated by the plot and characters aswell as the twist and turns the story took me through to unveil revelations you would have never have thought of. This book does not follow the sterotypical supernatural themes that are displayed on tv, but goes beyond that introducing you into a new magical world hidden in the midst of New York City. I was amazed by how modern and relatable the book was in some parts. I am now determined to own the whole series and cant wait till book six is released!!! :)",Keshika
9781406307627,"I had seen this book pop up on my updates-feed on goodreads so many times, that when I came across it at my library, I had to take it home with me. I wasn't particularly looking forward to reading this book, but I wanted to find out what the fuss was about. It seems that people either hate or love this book. And I ended up kind of loving it. City of Bones is the first instalment in the Mortal Instruments series. What I really liked about this book from the start is that it is set in modern times in New York City. Of course, many books are set in New York City (the Princess Diaries for example, a series I absolutely love, by the way) but this is fantasy. I had never read fantasy before that's set in NYC, but maybe that's just me. Anyway, City of Bones is about a teenage girl named Clary Fray whose mother is super overprotective and whose father died before she was even born. When she goes out clubbin' with her homie Simon - who's like a brother to her - she sees three teenagers kill this creepy dude. These three killers turn out to be Shadowhunters. ""What are Shadowhunters?"" you ask? If you really want to find out, I suggest you read this book, but in short: Shadowhunters are part angel, part demon fighting warriors. They're pretty badass and they basically protect us humans - or mundanes, as they like to call us - from demons. Which is pretty nice of them, isn't it? Clary is pretty freaked out after witnessing a murder. Unfortunately, this isn't the last time Clary encounters Shadowhunters, because soon her mother disappears and she gets attacked by a demon herself. This book is filled with hilarious dialogues and fast-paced action sequences. Perhaps it's just me, but I thought the action scenes were rather bloody. I didn't mind it, but I guess I'm not used to it. What I also really liked about this book were the characters. I must admit that not all of them were very original, but more on that later. I really liked the fact that so many characters dropped by in the storyline. You've got your five main characters: Clary, Simon, Jace, Isabelle and Alec. But there are also many characters that are only present for like a chapter or two, like Magnus Bane and Raphael. And I hope that, if those characters survived the first book, they'll reappear in one of the others books in the series as well. Those who hate on this book say, amongst many other things, that this book is very predictable. Now I did feel for the first half of the book, that I knew exactly what was going to happen. And I did predict several developments of the plot correctly. But the last 100 pages or so completely made up for that, because it contained one big plot twist and a couple of small ones. My mind was pretty blown after that plot twist. And I really enjoyed that. Another thing the haters argue is that many elements of City of Bones were copied and slightly altered from the Harry Potter-series. I did read somewhere on the interwebs ???????????????- and we all know how reliable that information is - that Clare originally started writing Harry Potter fan fiction. And that some paragraphs from those works were altered and used in City of Bones. Furthermore, I am able to recognize elements from Harry Potter in this book if I pay close attention to it. But I don't really want to. And I recommend you to not do so either, if you just want to get a good read out of this book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm definitely going to read the other ones in the series. I love reading about fantasy worlds that exist in our ""real"" world and the world of the Shadowhunters is a good example of that, although it might resemble the world of Harry Potter a little. Maybe that is exactly why I liked this book so much. After all I love the Harry Potter-books with all my heart and more!",Enya Wouts

One night later and Clary found herself face to face with the invisible murderer as he saves her from a demon, her mother already gone, and her home no longer safe. It would be three days before Clary would discover where she was and what had happened to her. Clary had never heard her mother speak of her past, indeed it was almost as though her mother didn't start existing until she was born, and Clary knew even less about her father. But all the secrets her mother kept have now left Clary confused and alone. With only the murderous strangers left to turn to will she survive long enough to find her mother and discover the truth?

The only real thing that he has is his dog, named the Doorman, who everyone says desperately needs a bath. And, he's in love with Audrey, a girl from a bad neighborhood, just like him, who also happens to be one of his best friends since forever. The thing is, Audrey doesn't know that Ed is in love with her, and worse yet, she says she doesn't believe in love. One day, Ed and his friend stop at a local bank, but a robbery begins while they are in line. And Ed stops the guy. So then he becomes a local hero. He is just trying to live a normal life, and then he gets a playing card in the mail with three addresses and times on it. Ed doesn't know what to do. Should he just throw the card away, like his friends instruct, or should he go to the first address to see what this is all about? This book would be a good recommendation for fans of THE DA VINCI CODE and the movie National Treasure. Ed is such a cool character! He seems like such a normal guy, who does things that normal guys do, and lives a very ordinary life. Until he gets the card in the mail, and he's not so ordinary anymore.",TeensReadToo
9780007442928,"Favourite Quote: ""We don't need you as an ally,"" says Tori. ""We're Dauntless"" Re-reading this book and decided to write a review this time! Since I love the first book so much, I knew the rest of the books could not live up to it and I was right! For me, Insurgent was a little bit disappointing and I give it a 4/5 stars! I'm finding it hard to pinpoint what exactly annoyed me about this book. I just felt that the first book had a good pace and everything flowed smoothly but in this one everything felt disoriented and sometimes I was confused! Maybe Veronica Roth wanted us to feel what it was like to be in Tris's head and used the plot to do that, I don't know. Other than that, I felt the plot was pretty complex as they were numerous things happening and a lot of information being revealed, sometimes it was hard to keep up but overall I felt the plot was great and definitely set up well for the next one! The amount of twists was also incredible! As for the characters, there was Tris who for me had a huge transformation from the first book. This was realistic as she suffered from so many losses and she was dealing with guilty, plus she had her current problems to do with. I have to admit all the lying she did to Four irritated the hell out of me! And that might also contribute to why this book wasn't as great as the first. Then there's Four, who is just as great in this book and he is in the first, seriously he's my book boyfriend!!!!!! As for the other characters, well each character either had their small storyline or were part of someone else's and that was interesting and entertaining. I seriously have no clue how Veronica Roth makes such great characters! Overall this book was good but not as good as the first! And this review is just my jumbled up thoughts that probably make absolutely no sense because I can't seem to write down what's in my head! Haha sorry!",brookexx
9780007442928,"Oh my freaking God. You know that feeling when you have about 15 pages left and you just want to wait a couple of minutes because you have a feeling you'll be loosing a friend in any moment so you want to savor it a little while longer? That's Insurgent. This book reminded me why I love books so so much. Because it is incredible. A roller-coaster full of emotions, action, love and so much more. Veronica Roth did it again. I thought Divergent was pure awesomeness, and Insurgent didn't disappoint one little bit. It was magic. Tris was even more amazing in this second instalment. She grew a lot as a character and she was totally baddass! How she managed not to break will always be a mystery to me. She is so brave, and she doesn't even know it. Tobias. Awww, a special place in my heart will always belong to him. He's so sweet and caring and still fierce and strong and he keeps trying even when the world looks like it has arrived to its end. He's amazing. The writing was so beautiful and I couldn't put the book dawn! I am so tired because of work, but I couldn't go to sleep because I needed to read. Yes, this book is that compelling. And I loved every second of it. So, if you are searching for a fast paced book filled with great-amazing-incredible-pure bliss action, a love that it's so great that can defeat anything, with a strong female baddass character, Insurgent is the perfect book for you!",Nea Barabea
9780007442928,"I loved Divergent and couldn't wait until Insurgent came out. I wasn't disappointed. It was a gripping read. I finished it in one weekend. It does dive straight into the story, no recap of the first book. I didn't mind that very much. It would be better if you have the first book fresh in your mind. You get to know the main characters Tris and Four/Tobias a lot better. Tris is not a one dimensional character, you get to see the good and the bad of her in this book. There is a lot of action and suspense. You really want to read on and get to know what happens next. This feeling won't leave you when you finish the book, because it ends with a big cliff hanger. I would like to add, that this is the first time I ordered from the bookdepository and I was pleasantly surprised. Great service and no shipping costs to The Netherlands.",Esther D.
9780007442928,"Everybody knows that anticipation can be both wonderful and terrible. When you spend a long time wanting something, sometimes when you get it, it fails to meet all those high expectations. That was not the case with Roth's sequel. INSURGENT LIVED UP TO MY EVERY HOPE! The dystopia in which Tris lives becomes even more vivid in Insurgent. The politics and power-struggles are more fierce, the themes of control and rebellion are more poignant. I loved the direction that this book took. Tris and Four's relationship hit some speed--bumps in this book, which is common in sequels. However, I'm glad that this remained a background conflict. Both Divergent and Insurgent keep the love interest as a pleasant aside, instead of making it the heart and soul of the story. I particularly loved the exploration of each faction in this book. While we saw a lot of the Abnegation and Dauntless factions in the first book, there were more situations involving Amity, Erudite and also The Factionless in Insurgent. I also really enjoyed how much more we learned about Tobias/Four's family. In my opinion, the book had only two teeny-tiny little drawbacks. Nothing so big that I'm going to give this any less than five stars! The first was that Tris kept shutting Tobias out. I always find it irksome in books when characters don;t just talk about things which are blatantly going to cause trouble. Still, it did up the conflict. The second thing was something which always annoys me about sequels... You know when you watch a TV show which ends on a big cliffhanger and then you have to wait a week for the second part? Well, before part two airs there's always a catch up, right? A quick 'n' dirty thirty-second recap which just refreshes the ol' noggin. Well, the older I get and the more books I read, the more I think all series books should have a paragraph or two at the start which reminds people like me what the hell is going on! Like I said, I'm not gonna take a star off because I get confused easily! He he. All in all, this rocked. I can't wait for book three to come out. The ending of this book promises BIG things and it's going to be an agonising wait!",Laura Williams
9780007442928,"It's hard to know where to start with this book. Insurgent has been anticipated for months by fans of Divergent, myself included, and so it had a lot to live up to. I am very pleased to say that it more than lived up to expectations and I'd go as far as saying that it was better than Divergent! Hard to believe for a lot of you, right? I thought that Divergent was great, but Insurgent was spectacular. Roth has already introduced us to her dystopian society and bold characters and in Insurgent, we get to learn a lot more about both. There are a whole load of twists, turns and revelations in Insurgent and you'll probably find yourself changing your opinions on factions and people every few pages - nothing that is happen is simple - it's all very dramatic. This is real edge of your seat reading and it most probably will keep you awake at night, as it's so very compelling! I felt like I got to know the characters a lot better in this book. I felt as though I grew closer to Tris and understood her more, and although I did find her to be a little silly in her actions at points, she is an incredible heroine. Tris isn't completely strong or brave though, as she is still haunted and uneasy from witnessing so many deaths. As expected, Tris is still battling with herself and her Divergent categorisation. Her vulnerability let me into her mindset and let me like her more. I certainly formed more of a fondness towards Tobias (Four) in this book, too (and by that, I mean that I now wish he could be my boyfriend). Following on from Divergent, Tris and Tobias's relationship has developed well and I really, really loved the bond that they have - oh, plus there were some very romantic scenes that were just... swoon-worthy. As aforementioned, my opinions of most of the characters changed a lot throughout. I was so pleased that we were given more information about the factions (especially Amity, who we didn't hear much about in Divergent). The story and characters are surprisingly complex. Roth makes all of her characters seem real and interact in a very authentic way. It did feel as though I knew the people that I was reading about and I was willing them on to make the right decisions. I actually gasped in disbelief at some things. I could see where the book was heading, but I definitely wouldn't call it predictable - there were quite a few moments when I gasped in disbelief! There is just so much that happens and nearly everything that is mentioned is purposeful and contributes to the story. If you want a nice relaxing read, this isn't it - It's a bit of a roller coaster to say the least - it'll have you laughing at some parts and worrying at others. However, if you want a grabbing, engrossing and addictive read, this is it. There is a major cliffhanger at the end of Insurgent and I actually can not wait to see what happens in the next instalment - it sounds like it's going to be phenomenal. I really can't get enough of this series and urge you to all go out, buy this book and get reading now! This series really does feel like it could be the next best thing to The Hunger Games.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

It also has a sequel (set a few hundred yrs later) ""A world with no End"" same story line, with addition of nuns, more architecture and the European plague!

9780141340159,"This series just keeps getting better and better, I just love it. Meyer has crafted such a fabulous world in these retellings and with such well-drawn characters that you can't help but to root for them, and to wish they were your friends ... or lover as is the case with captain Thorne. ""Captain, I think I am in love with you"" O captain, my captain, how I love thee. I have loved him since Cinder stumbled upon him in Scarlet, he's such as cocky rapscallion and I love it. I think I must have a thing for scoundrels with hearts of gold or something like that ;-) I enjoyed getting to see a whole new side to him though and learning that he is not just a selfish criminal. Cress is a lovely new addition to the cast, she is such a sweet girl, surprisingly relatable and a lot less crazier than you would expect from someone who has been alone in a satelitte most of her life. She grew a lot during the course of her adventures and I can't wait to see more growth from her in Winter. And Iko, can someone please get me my own Iko already, thank you. I love how she has no brain/mouth filter and just says what's on her mind, usually it is the same thing that is on the readers mind. Iko is definitely my favourite character and I hope she gets and keeps that perfect humanoid body of her dreams by the end of the chronicles. I love how the plot builds and builds with each book, and Cress had many great new developments that I can't wait to see fleshed out in the next book. And that book cannot come out soon enough, it is going to be so good. @ natheartsbooks.blogspot.co.uk",Natalie Johnson
9780007466696,"In retrospect, it might have been a better idea to review it before reading the installemnts, but I couldn't stop reading to actually do it! It was that good. I finished the entire series in less than half a week. Despite the fact that I hadn't even wanted to read it for a long time, claiming I wasn't interested. It's main theme was romance after all, and I'm not usually into sheer romance without further ado like something paranormal. Well, I was wrong after all, very very wrong. Since the synopsis summarizes it rather thoroughly, way better than I could, I will start with the review right away. More accurately I will start with the plot right away. Honestly, I loved every moment of it. I was engaged maximally, not being able to stop because there was always something happening. It was not only about the Selection and the romance, but the dystopian world and the complications of life as well and these all together resulted an intriguing and colorful story. Secondly, the world building. I really liked the idea of being in the future where anarchy is set up again. This is something that could indeed happen to us, because why not? Who knows how long this system will pull out, if after a 4th World War we won't start changing things dramatically. And frankly, Ms Cass brought out the most of it. The rebel attacks and the layers of it add a lot to the story, the castes and jobs are brilliant and the idea of the Selection is utterly unique. The history piqued my attention, too. I felt as id I was on a real history lesson and was being taught our own past. However, the most exceeding aspect was the characterization. I loved the characterization. The characters were all individuals, some of them lovable, some of them strangable, but all of them as if they were real, breathing people. America, our protagonist, grew the closer to my heart with her stubbornness and strong temper which yet didn't prevent her from being a purely good soul, a person who loves with whole heart and wants to help where she can. I adored her way of thinking, but could have strangled her sometimes, especially when she bottled up and held back things that could have made her situation easier. Maxon, the prince, was a lot different from how I imagined. Through Americas eyes we first think he's stuck-up, just because he is what he is, but when we first meet him...Even though America doesn't even like him in the beginning, it's obvious he's not any of those bad things she thought. In fact, he's caring, loving and smart, and adorably insecure around crying women, but knows little about the real misery of the world. Later on they develop a friendly relationship nevertheless, the cutest friendship I have ever seen, however, the affection is visible from the very start. As for Apen, I didn't think much of him. He was sort of a jerk in my eyes, however, the end left me a little clueless concerning his intentions. And last but not the least, Kiera Cass's writing style is something distinct and charming. More than that, it's captivating. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was so big-time. by Cassidie @ Rebook424",Boglarka Kenedi

I finished the book in 3 days, if you know my I normally read a book in 3 weeks (shortest) because I get a bit bored sometimes or I just can't find time but I got addicted to this book and couldn't stop.

9780007466696,"A prince and thirty-five girls who fight for his heart. What first sounds like a regular YA contemporary, fast proves that this princess' story is more on the darker side of royalty. By writing THE SELECTION Kiera Cass created a story more dystopian than contemp. The United States have been destroyed and people are divided by a caste system, that ranges from a 1 for the royal family to 8 for unemployed people who don't contribute to society. This promises to be a world building with a deeper running conflict potential to lure in many YA readers. Prince Maxon is a beau, rich and most popular bachelor in the kingdom. So THE SELECTION sure has a love story. But it's not only about Maxon looking for a bride. It seems the prince has to compete for one of his ladies' heart, too. America is the girl in the middle of a love triangle. Prince Maxon is a gentle man, on the shy side and not the confident leader one expects him to be. So it was only natural girls would fall for America's first love, too. His name is Aspen and he is manly, confident and the gorgeous boy next door. The love story between America and Aspen really put a spell on me. He is America's first love and I loved to read about their tender and tentative feelings for each other growing into something shiny and beautiful. My heart ached as much as America's when they had to part and America left for the palace. Once in the palace, America is a part of the competition. And the contest is what keeps THE SELECTION expectionally delightful. The girls have to master all kinds of challenges and public appearances. Fun and glee are guaranteed, because these girls don't always play fair. Expect tender moments as well as scenes that can fast escalate into a cat fight. 5/5 ***** THE SELECTION - Poofy dresses, sparkling dates with a prince and a dream life the palace. A very princess-like read! THE SELECTION is a 2012 debut that filled a gap in the wide YA range. It has the romance and girly power of a contemporary and the disrupted world hinting at its dystopian character.",MissPageTurner
9780007466696,"To be frank, I thought I would hate this book. I thought that it would be one of those books that write prose poetry and it would be one of those books that take half a series to actually get to the good parts. I even thought I would hate the book. And boy, was I wrong. The book had characters you'll love, plots to die for and plot twists to steer you off roads. The Selection is about a working class young woman who was raffled into a competition to win the heart of Prince Maxton. She is one of 35 girls who will fight to get a chance to date and fall in love with the next King. It sound so much like Cinderella? Surprising enough, the author may have gotten the inspiration from the old story but she made it unique enough to make it her own. I'm amazed at how fast the book picked up and how easy it was to fall in love with the characters. Aspen, America, Maxton, even the other girls in the competition (good or bad) were all easy to like. The writing style was wonderful and easy to get through. For the veteran readers out there, you'll probably devour this book in a day or two. America Singer doesn't fall for the prince. She is in love with someone else. Someone below her station. Someone who has to work many jobs to keep his mother and siblings alive. Someone close to reality and not a shining man in armor like the prince. The world of The Selection involved Princess Diaries Makeovers, Balls, flowing gowns, summer dresses and a fantasy world that makes girls weak to their knees. Kiera Cass has definitely wrote herself a best-selling book teens will enjoy to the fullest. Only regret I have is my gradually decreasing joy for the Young Adult genre. I should have loved this book a lot more but I think it's my time to move on to a different genre.",Najla Qamber

9780007466696,"Throw all my favorite Disney movies in a mixer, add the talents of a great writer and some dystopian dust (you know, like fairy dust. Haha.), mix it up and voila! I got myself a brand favorite book of the year that makes my inner child come to life again (aka run around screaming with her arms in the air in a pink princess dress and a fake crown on her head). Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: THE SELECTION! ""I hope you find someone you can't live without.I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it's like to have to try and live without them."" I think it's obvious already that I loved this book. In case it wasn't, well, I did. I do. I love the story and the characters and everything about it! America is such a great main character, someone I could relate to in many ways. If I were to live in her world, I would be like her. A five. Only three steps up from nothing. But while she doesn't want to be a princess, I have always dreamed of it since I saw my first disney film so many years ago. I loved her and she would make a great Disney princess! (This book would be awesome as an animated Disney film, too.) Now I shall talk about the first fictional character ever I fell in love with. (Seriously I shed a tear because I knew he wasn't real. Sigh.) Of course I'm talking about Maxon. He's so... Maxon. Sigh again. Maxon. Okay moving on. Aspen. I loved him at first. So romantic and loving and caring and then... a complete stupid douchebag. I hate him. Speaking of hating someone... I hated Celeste. She's so mean and stuck up and bleh. But I loved Marlee and May and all the other characters! As I said, I loved this story. We got to know America while the story builds in the beginning until the inevitable moment she gets chosen for The Selection. She stays true to who she is and never forgot where she came from, another thing I loved about her by the way. She's different from the other girls in many ways and refuses to change for anyone. I loved how the relationship between her and Maxon grew along with the story and I fell for Maxon along with America. And when they kissed my inner child was so happy she fainted. Yes, that happens. But not everything is rainbows and sunshine in the palace. There are these rebels, what their purpose is we have yet to find out, who form a threat to the royal family and I liked that. That's what gives it an extra dystopian touch. But life goes on in the palace and I loved every part of it! Until that douchebag Aspen came back into the story and messed things up again. I hope for him that he doesn't mess things up in the next book or else... Well not much he is a fictional character so I can't do much... But if he were real, I would kick is ass. For sure. So in the end, this book is everything I hoped it would be and more. I can't wait to start the sequel (luckily I don't have to since I just got a copy from Netgalley, yay!). Great job Kiera!

9780141340234,"As much as I loved ""Cinder,"" I love ""Scarlet"" at least as much and maybe even more! When it comes to young adult fantasies/fairy tales, I cannot recommend these books highly enough. marissa Meyer is an absolute masterful storyteller, and her books are completely free of two things--profanity and sex. For me, this is the most refreshing part of this book. It is over 400 pages of almost nonstop action with somewhat familiar characters told in a post-modern setting. Yes, there is some violence, but none of the descriptions make me recoil. My daughter is almost ten, and this is the first truly young adult series that I would be comfortable with her reading. One of the things that amazes me is that Marissa Meyer actually makes me like her fantasy books. i am one who generally does not like fantasy books, but once in a while, I find one I like. And this series is definitely a keeper. She explains things so that they somehow logically make sense. And the links between the various characters are absolutely incredible. One more thing--don't expect an ending that ties up all the loose ends. Just like she did with ""Cinder,"" she has left you somewhat hanging. This is a book that I recommend you start with caution (but please read ""Cinder"" first) because once you start it, you won't want to stop! I won this book, and I reviewed it because I wanted to. No one asked me to review it, and all opinions are 100 percent mine.",Ruth Hill
9780141340234,"Warning: There may be spoilers for Cinder as this is the second book in a series and it picks up right where Cinder left off. Scarlet Benoit's Grandmother is missing and no one but Scarlet seems to want to do a thing to find her. When her father stumbles into her farmhouse claiming that he was kidnapped and tortured by some people who are tattooed with a similar tattoo that she noticed on a street fighter named Wolf earlier that day, Scarlet begrudgingly seeks Wolf's help, but there is something that is just a little too animalistic and unsettling about him. Meanwhile Cinder is escaping from prison and ends up enlisting the help of 'Captain' Thorne. Installing Iko's personality chip into a barely working spaceship they leave earth and plan what to do next. Cinder knows she should go to Africa, but she is still reluctant to accept her role as princess. I was wary starting Scarlet, as I didn't want to leave Cinder and Kai's story behind to start on a new one about new people. I was worried that Scarlet's story would mean Cinder would only pop up at the very end, however straight away those fears were quashed. Cinder is very much still a main character in this novel and it follows her as she struggles to deal with the fallout of the ball and everything that happened to her only days before. Through Cinder we are introduced to a new character, Thorne, who seems to be in this novel mainly for some much needed comic relief and a way to get Cinder Our of New Beijing however, I believe his role in this series will become more important in Cress. Scarlet is very different from Cinder, that much is clear from the get go, while Cinder is a mechanic who very much wants to remain hidden and lets other people deal with their own problems Scarlet is an outspoken young farmer who knows how to handle a gun and isn't afraid to get into a fight. I know some people had issues with Scarlet's character but I liked her bad attitude and tough persona. One thing I greatly appreciate with this series is Meyer's determination to make the women in it much more than the damsel in distress. They fight their own battles and do job's that are not regularly occupied by women; Cinder is a mechanic, Scarlet is a farmer, and while yes Cress is a prisoner she's also a hacker. They are not your typical fairytale heroins. The Romance in this novel is also different from the slow burn and sweet glances between Cinder and Kai. It's not much of a spoiler to say that Scarlet and Wolf are the love interests this time round and their chemistry is like an explosion, not a spark. Both their personalities can be a mixture of sweet and volatile, meaning that even though they only known each other a short amount of time they spend so much of it in tight corners that their whirlwind romance is understandable. As with Cinder I didn't find any of the 'twists' to be anything but predictable but unlike Cinder I didn't feel that the 'big reveals' were the epicentre of the plot and therefore I didn't feel frustrated that the characters hadn't realised it, or that the author wasn't doing enough to cleverly conceal it so I wasn't as bothered. I loved this story, however the reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was because I felt like Meyer wrote too many indecisions in to keep the series going for longer. If Cinder had just let Kai know that she was really the Lunar Princess then they could have kick started a rebellion, but instead I feel like that's being drawn out until the next novel just so that Meyer can write a series of 4 retelling and drag it out for longer than needs be. It's arguable that we might miss some characters etc... so I'm on the fence as to whether or not it's pointless to do so but I still think it was a bit of an obvious attempt to keep the series going. However it's faults does not distract from it's overall positives.",Iona
9780141340234,"This book has NO ""negative"" reviews! Now I have to be the weirdo. This review will have spoilers about Cinder, so don't read on if you don't want to know. I hoped Scarlet would redeem the series for me since I was one of the few people who wasn't a fan of Cinder. While I know why Marissa Meyer set Cinder in China (because the tale of Cinderella originated there,) the way she handled the culture was a complete mess, and greatly hindered my enjoyment throughout the novel. Thank goodness, I only had to bear Meyer's misuse of Chinese honorifics in one scene in Scarlet. Scarlet, on the other hand, is largely set in France--a country I have no experience/associations with and therefore would not notice if there were cultural discrepancies. I was right, Scarlet annoyed me a lot less than Cinder did, but still a book I would hesitate to wholeheartedly recommend. Juvenile Writing, Tackling Uneasy Subjects and Relationships: This is more of a personal gripe. I just checked Amazon, and apparently Scarlet is targeted towards ages 12 and up (I always thought the book was targeted towards 16 and up, oops!,) so I guess the lengthy writing that often made me feel like Meyer is underestimating her readers is suitable after all. There is a scene were the author suggests a one night stand (okay, maybe it was a one week stand, but that's not that much better) and also the brief suggestion of rape in another. Being that the age level is twelve, I see why these topics are glossed over, but it also makes me feel like the author is not confident enough to tackle these issues despite throwing them in. Queen Levana: GIMMIE THE BACKSTORY!: I know I am supposed to hate Levana, but I had problems finding a reason to hate her. I get that she wants world domination--and that's always bad--but I wanted to find out WHY she wanted so many people to love her. Was she bullied? A social outcast? World domination is not easy. Not sure why she has to marry Kai either. Why not just kill him and win world domination through conquest? But I just imagine her as a desperate cougar. I would personally spend my time reading than ruling the world. Cinder tries to make her hateful by describing her burn wounds as a baby, but I felt that was too forced. If her orchestrating the mutation of her people into werewolves and the destruction of thousands of lives didn't make me hate her, a baby getting burned won't miraculously do the trick. If Cinder's stepmother made me feel for her, despite her ""evilness"" (which I felt was one of the brighter moments in Cinder,) Queen Levana should have a fleshed out story as well. Maybe her story is revealed in the novella? I certainly hope so. Cinder, Poor Girl Gets Overshadowed: I like Cinder and Scarlet equally, they both have their strengths, but also can be too oblivious or have anger issues. While reading the story, I felt much more invested in Scarlet's character and Cinder quickly became overshadowed. I also felt Cinder became less appealing, not only because she was overshadowed, but because everything became too convenient with her new Lunar powers. Now not only did she have cyborg powers of quick problem solving and the ability to fix hardware by connecting them to her...head? but also mind-control AND the ability to make spaceships undetectable. It felt like every time the author hit a plot hole, she ""solved"" it by giving Lunars a new ability. ""Oh shoot, how is Cinder going to break out of prison? Eh, she can just mind control the guard with her Lunar gift! Oh shoot, how is Cinder going to travel undetected in a gigantic spaceship? Um, well Lunars have the ability to do that too! Oh no, Cinder is stuck in a crowd, how will she get out of it? That's easy! Her Lunar gift can change her appearance to disguise her from everyone!"" What can this girl NOT do? And how much of it is actually attributed to her as a person...and not because she has the ability to download and process manuals from the Internet. Suddenly, it felt like Cinder became invincible. Her ""let's connect electronics to my cyborg brain"" thing made her even harder to relate to. Cinder & Kai: I was okay with Cinder & Kai's relationship in Cinder--even though Kai didn't have much of a personality aside from being handsome (he also has way too much time on his hands for being the leader of the entire Eastern Commonwealth.) In Cinder, he struck me as a very poor leader, spending his time being angry, relying on his advisors, not showing up on time to state meetings, and hitting on a girl. Kai really got the short end of the stick in Scarlet, in the few scenes he does appear in, he only serves as background details to the plot. He still has yet to win me over. I wonder how Kai and Cinder relationship will work out, precisely, how Kai will react when he finds out Cinder's true identity as Princess Selene. Will he be jumping for joy? And how will he convince Cinder to be with him without being a jerk that's like ""I know you are the princess, so let's marry and everything will be fine and dandy! And let's ignore the whole part about locking you up in prison, doubting you, and stuff."" It's going to be sappy. I can just feel it. Scarlet & Wolf, Echoes of Twilight/A Discovery of Witches: Not instalove, but dangerously close. Their relationship progressed in the way that romance novels do: the characters don't trust one another and there's some tension, but then they suddenly realize that they are made for one another. How fast their relationship gave me this schadenfreude feeling. I didn't want it to be THAT easy. I WANTED THEM NOT TO WORK OUT. I am evil like that. And because I thought Scarlet did not deserve Wolf. Seriously, that girl has some anger issues. When Wolf comments on her scent, she immediately snaps at him, telling him it's none of his business. That is NOT how you treat a guy who is willing to help you track down your missing grandmother. There's a difference between being a badass and being rude and ungrateful. I admit, there were some sweet moments, but when I got to the end, their relationship made me wince. I felt Wolf had more development than Kai though, so I did root for him. But there was a point where I just felt bad for him because Scarlet was just--mean. I could just picture him being that wounded dog thrown out into the rain. And then came the Twilight echoes. Scarlet was made to be this independent, strong-willed girl, but then she still depended so much on Wolf to save the day. There are moments when she overestimates herself, kind of like Diana from A Discovery of Witches. And then Wolf had the whole ""I am too dangerous for you! You have no idea how close I was to harming you..."" thing. Ugh. Blending Fairytale with Sci-fi: I appreciate how Meyer weaved sci-fi and fairy tales together. The fairy tale elements are often in the background, while the characters have a life of their own. There was a moment, when Scene ran onto a stage in an opera house that was supposed to be a ""forest,"" that struck me as heavy handed and unnecessary. Perhaps it was especially annoying because she was supposed to be in great danger, yet the author still makes her run through a stupid cardboard ""forest"" for the sake of tying it into the fairytale. Oh, poor Scarlet! Addressing Plot-Holes: THOSE ID CHIPS The id-chips left me with a lot of questions in Cinder: how did these id-chip stealing androids get placed in a government facility? Is this a conspiracy? And I am glad Meyer addressed them. Somewhat. I still felt it could have been better handled. Apparently the general public CARE about those chips, and would riot if they knew it was stolen, because it's VERY important to the family--or so it is said. Which is a surprise, because nobody seems to care enough to claim it after their loved one's death. Or even notice its disappearance. ID-chips causing a riot? I doubt it. Overall, I felt Scarlet was slightly stronger than Cinder due to more character development in the new characters, though it also had quite a few flaws that made Scarlet a slow read for me. Scarlet has the same fast-paced, action-packed, sci-fi and loose fairytale qualities I enjoyed in Cinder though. It's a pity that Cinder and Kai recede into the background, which makes me scared that the next books will do the same thing and introduce more new characters at the expense of the old. If you loved Cinder, I am certainly you will love Scarlet. Just be prepared not to see Kai or Cinder too much. As for me, although I was not impressed with the series thus far, each book for slightly different reasons, I know I will probably still read the next book, hoping it will change my mind. I am determined to like this series!",Lilian (A Novel Toybox)
9780141340234,"I LOVE THIS SERIES!!! If you haven't read Cinder you need to because this is an epic series. Now that we're in to book 2 there was a lot more action. It was nonstop! Scarlet (red riding hood) was looking for her grandmother who'd gone missing. The authorities had given up the search claiming a suicide/runaway, but Scarlet couldn't believe that. She found a guy named Wolf that could possibly help her. They went on a wild adventure trying to keep from getting caught or killed as they searched for answers to the disappearance. Scarlet was feisty with a temper and stood up for others, a great addition to the cast. Don't worry, there was plenty of Cinder and Kai in the story too. The Point of View switched between Scarlet, Cinder, Kai, and sometimes Wolf and Thorne. Thorne was pretty hilarious by the way. I won't tell you about him so you can find out for yourself. I didn't get bored when the POV switched because I loved all the characters and want to know what was going on with each of them. Scarlet was an intense read full of run-for-your-life adventure and romance. I can't wait to read book 3! Content Ratings: sexual: mild language: very mild violence: moderate",Clean Teen Fiction
9780141340234,"Fairytales in the future, fairytales in space. If you haven't read Cinder yet, pick it up and give it a whirl. Scarlet is a new character to the series, but there is still plenty about Cinder in this one. Even my favorite robot personality is back. As the first one resembled Cinderella, this one favors Little Red Riding Hood. There is of course the necessary ""big, bad wolf"", who is definitely big and bad, but in Wolf's own special way - so he's got you questioning everything. Yep, there is a grandmother in this one as well. So there are familiar parts to the Little Red Riding Hood story, but this is not the story from your childhood. This is a re-imagined world where the girls aren't damsels in distress, but are kicking butt and taking names. Marissa Meyer has a way with weaving an old, simple tale into something sci-fi, romantic, and action packed all at the same time. And she does it keeping the characters interesting and the story fresh. There is a political drama weaved into the story, it's actually the glue that is holding all of these characters together and giving them something to fight for. If you love fairytales, cyborgs, space ships, and a little swooning mixed in, this is a series for you! ARC reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.

9780140385724,"This is the story of the greasers and the Socs, the two social groups in the boys' town. The greasers are kind of a family of friends, because for most of them all they have is each other. The Socs are more violent and like to fight. They are the rich kids who have things that the greasers can only dream of. They fight every once in a while -- but one night someone takes it too far. From that point on the story surrounds the two boys who are on the run from the ""fuzz"" (police). The story is told from the viewpoint of Ponyboy Curtis, who is a fourteen-year-old greaser. He has two brothers, Darry Curtis and Sodapop Curtis. Their parents were killed a few years back, but the courts let them stay together as long as they stayed out of trouble. This book is about so much more than the cliche of popular boys vs. loser boys. There are feelings and characters that you want to see succeed. That's what makes this book different from all the others, in a good way of course. I liked that the characters seemed so real, like you really knew them! I love it when a book is like that.

9781862305274,"""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"" by John Boyne, is a fictional story set during the time of the Holocaust. When Bruno, the main character is forced to move away from his Berlin home with his family, his live changes forever. His beautiful home in Germany is replaced by a much smaller, duller house, which is also the location of his father's downstairs office. His father does not explain or discuss his occupation with his children. However, (us) the readers soon realises that Bruno's father is a Nazi Commandant in Auschwitz. Despite the setting, the reader is spared many of the horrific details of what actually took place in the concentration camps itself. This, I believe, increases the shock when we discover exactly what is going in there. The style of the writing is clear and straightforward because it explores and captures the mind of a child. The deliberate mistakes of ""Fury"" for Fuhrer, and ""Out-With"" for Auschwitz are funny in a dark sort of way and made me feel a strong sense of foreboding right form the start. Although the book is easy to read, it deals with some very serious themes and issues which at time I found heart-breaking. I would consider this book is unsuitable for any reader under the age of eleven or twelve. It is however, a very good, thought-provoking read for teenagers and adults. I hope I have not given away the ending1 I would recommend this book and I give it a 4/5",Thea Curley

This is a re-read but I think that I feel a lot of the same things. Yes, a few things may be colored because this is a re-read after I watched the movie. Which, yes, I enjoyed the movie. I think that the casting was dead on, and I was emotional for the whole thing. I couldn't remember what detail the end of the book went into that the movie didn't but that is the one thing my mom complained about going into the movie without reading the book. I loved the realistic nature of the relationship between Adam and Mia. They are both so in love with music and I think that the draw of seeing someone else your age just get it is believable and made me totally immerse into their relationship. Music, and the importance on their life wasn't watered down for them, the book explored so many issues that would have been sources of possible problems for teenagers in love. The fact that she wants to get into Julliard and Adam and his band are on the brink of something huge. The emotions of Mia, having to make a choice, to stay without her mom, dad and brother, who were such a close family. They did life together, they were open and honest with each other. But most of all, they loved each other hard, no matter their differences. I don't know what I would have chosen in her place, and it was all powerful and beautifully written.

9781406321333,"Boy oh boy. Does Cassandra Clare know how to rip your heart out of your chest, stomp on it a few times, chuck it around and then break it into millions of tiny fragments. I can honestly say I've never had a book affect me as much as Clockwork Prince did. Which is a great way have a first review! I even thought that Clockwork Angel was brilliant - and if that was brilliant, then God knows what this was. Sheer amazingness? I hate to think what Clockwork Princess will be like! Throughout this whole novel I was captivated. Not once did I want to put it down and go to sleep like I should have done. Okay, there was one part where I had to set the book down, as I felt like I was about to explode. Literally. I must have screamed No! No! No! No! over and over and over in my head a trillion times. Cassandra Clare has a definite knack for writing. Just look at how popular TMI and ID are. And the most amazing thing is that her books are full of substance, they are full of character. They mean something. In the second novel in the Infernal Devices, we delve more and more into the Shadowhunter world, with familiar faces cropping up and new ones being introduced. Cassie has clearly done her research well on the locations in the book - I've never read anyone who is not from London describe a city so well. And for a Victorian freak like me, having her novel set in Victorian London is just a God-send, and not once did she disappoint! Her language was eloquent and beautiful, but allowed the reader to understand what was going on within the time period constraints. And for many writers, that is such a hard task! What I love about CP as well is how even though Cassie is a modern writer, she writers as if she is from the Victorian era. All the affections and mannerisms that are shown in the book are true to the time period, there's no sugar coating it. And what I loved about Clockwork Prince is that it is not centred directly on *that* love triangle (more on that later!!). We get the other characters, that other authors might have left out. Cassie leaves no brick unturned here. We are given Charlotte and Henry, Sophie, Magnus. These back stories could be the backbone of the series - especially as a prequel to TMI. Which again, Cassie doesn't forget about. Everything links up, and I mean EVERYTHING. I can literally not wait to get home to Australia where my first three TMI books are and re-read them. Everything that Cassie writes has a meaning, as a purpose, a background, a story. And one thing that has now got me hooked is the fact that she mentioned that Edinburgh, my Edinburgh, has an Institute. Does Cassie realize what she's done now? Every time I walk past a church, I'm going to be wondering. And hoping. And looking. And then there's them. Yes, those characters. The most exquisitely, beautifully, brilliant characters that trump all the rest. Tessa, Jem and Will. Oh Will. Will, Will, Will. What that boy does to me should be considered illegal. I'd always thought that the one fictional character who had me quaking in my boots was Mr. Thornton from North and South, but boy oh boy, has he been tossed aside (well, not quite tossed aside. I still see him regularly on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays). Will is just....there are things that Will does to me that no fictional character should ever be able to do. My heart just cries for him. Yes, Jem is great. He's that sweet guy that every girl wants to have in their life, but Jem just doesn't do it for me like Will does. I fell in love even more with Will in CP. And Tessa...a character you couldn't relate to any more. Wow, she's just amazing. Absolutely brilliant! Needless to say, I think I'm going to have to find some sort of book drug den (if that even exists!) to tie me over until Clockwork Princess comes out next year.

The book was amazing. I can't find a word to describe it. At first, I liked the first book better than the second, but the ending totally made me change my mind, so I love both of them equally. Lets get to Tessa. She annoyed me a bit in this book. Her constant indecisiveness on who she loves more, Will or Jem made her appear as a spoiled person to me. She kept changing her mind over and over, which made me wonder if she truly loved leither one, or of she just loves them because she couldn't find a better choice. I loved how Sophie, the housemaid, was more involved in this book. I especially enjoyed her love life. While she might have an ugly scar, she is truly beautiful from the inside. I cant seem to choose between Will and Jem in this book either. Finally, we get to learn more about the mysterious Will Herondale, which is pretty exciting. Jem is as beautiful as ever, and in this book, he shows himself more. He doesn't let people take advantage of him anymore, which pleased me alot. In this book, I got to learn many things about the characters, especially that I finally found out who the mysterious traitor is.

9780385737951,"Thomas is brought up to the Glade in an elevator with only his name and no memory at all. He finds himself with a group of boys like himself. They all have no memory of an outside world. All they know is that there is a maze and they will try to find a way out -but every night the doors to the maze will shut. The day after Thomas arrives, a girl, the first ever in the Glade, arrives with a note that she is the last. Thomas is determined to figure out what is happening in the Glade and unlock the secrets that are buried. THE MAZE RUNNER is the start to a thrilling new trilogy. If you are a fan of dystopian science fiction, then this title needs to be added to your must-read pile. Author James Dashner has a brilliant start to the book; the Gladers use different slang, which takes some time to get used to. However, this leaves the reader feeling just as jarred as Thomas when the book starts and you find yourself learning about the Glade right along with the main character. I've never really had that experience with a book before, so kudos to Mr. Dashner for a brilliant storytelling device. The story has somewhat of a slow start, but readers who stick with it will be rewarded. I'm warning you - there are lots of cliffhangers and heart-stopping adventure, and you'll want to stay up late turning pages to find out what happens next.",TeensReadToo

9780142418475,"This is one of my favorite books. I love the story and the way it is written. The characters are great and funny. The book wasn't at all what I expected it to be, it was way better. I fell in love at the very beginning and I will find myself rereading this book in the future. The writing was beautiful, the pacing was great, and the storyline rocked. It kept me entertained and I never once got bored. The title of the book says it all, and it's fun to say and very memorable. The cover is really cool, but it almost doesn't match the story. I wish it had two guys or something on it. I would most definitely read this again, and tell my friends to read it. I'd rate it a 5/5",Ashlea McDaid

9780141339603,"Favourite Quote: ""Each day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything's possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time"" First of all I just want to say, I LOVED this book! 5/5 stars! Highly recommend to people who like dystopian, as this is one of the best dystopian's I've ever read. Let's start with the plot. It is told from dual perspective by Day and June. I felt this really helped the reader understand the different parts of the dystopian world, the poor and the rich. It was steady-paced in my opinion which allowed me to familiarize with this new world and appreciate the character's developments. However most of the plot twists I had already guessed and nothing was surprising but that did not stop me from loving this book or enjoying the plot! Onto the characters, let's start with Day because I preferred his perspective over June's. Day was my favourite character, he was loyal, smart, a survivor and in some points in the book there's mentions of his generosity when it comes to other people. Then there's June who I believe had the most character development throughout the book. At first she is snobby, cocky and a bit irritating but she turns out to be a strong heroine who is very smart and independent with a vulnerable side. Other side characters, I loved Tess she was a little sweetheart, I hated all the people in the government except June's brother I liked what we saw of him. I have mixed feelings on the romance, I have no idea why but I prefer Day with Tess because I didn't feel like they have a sibling bond thing between them and they just it each other well. However it doesn't bother me the relationship between Day and June, I'm not really interested in it. As I said before I highly recommend this book to everyone and I cannot wait to read the next one!",brookexx
9780141339603,"(Source: Purchased on kindle from Amazon.co.uk for PS2.99.) 15-year-old Day is a wanted criminal. His own mother believes him dead, and his only friend is a girl who he met on the streets. When his youngest brother is diagnosed with the plague though, Day knows that it's up to him to steal the cure from the hospital for him, no matter what it takes. 15-year-old June is an orphan, and her older brother Metias is her only living relative. June is a child prodigy, the only person ever to score a perfect 1500 on 'the trial' - a test that every 10 year old must go through. Metias is a captain in the military, and June can't wait to join him, until disaster strikes and Metias is killed. Now June is making it her mission to find the boy who killed her brother and make him pay, and her sights are set firmly on Day. Did Day really kill Metias though? Can Day save his brother and escape with his life? And what will happen when June and Day finally meet? This was an enjoyable dystopian story, and I liked the suspense as the story progressed. Day and June were both likeable characters, and both cared deeply for their respective families. I liked the way that both had strong ideas about right and wrong, and both cared enough to stick their necks out when they felt the situation required it. I liked the storyline, and liked the way that Day and June became acquainted with one another. I was quite shocked when it was revealed that Metias was dead as I wasn't expecting it at all, although there were other things that I did manage to predict. I don't think there was a lot of romance in this one though, the storyline mainly focused on June and Day individually. There was quite a lot of suspense in this one though, waiting for June and Day to meet, wondering what will happen when they do, and wondering how it will all end! I did like the ending, and I am looking forward to reading the next in the series, I have a feeling that I will probably need to read books 2 and 3 quite close together though so I may wait to read Prodigy when book 3 is released. Overall; an enjoyable and suspenseful dystopian. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780141339603,"First of all I'd like to thank Lindsey from Puffin books for sending me this paperback copy to read and review. I had heard good things about this dystopian novel so I was really excited to be offered the chance to read it. Second of all I'd like to say wow! This is such a gripping read, I was hooked after just a few pages and from then on I struggled to put it down. I found it really easy to visualise everything that was happening, it felt like I was reading a movie. The story is set in an America of the future, no longer The United States it is a very dark and different world to the one we know today. Plagues, wars and children being forced to take trials that will affect the rest of their lives are just some of the horrors that this future world has to endure. Controlling all of this is a government full of secrets and corruption, it's no wonder there are people who attempt to fight against them to discover the truth. This brings me onto Day - handsome, brave and desperately seeking justice for the wrongs that have forced him away from his family. I loved his use of the word 'goddy', this is now one of my new favourite words! June is intelligent and also brave, you can really sense her feelings of loss and confusion as she struggles to figure out who she can and can't trust. The story alternates between Day's and June's point of view, they are both strong characters who are not afraid of danger and this made for such an exciting read. My heart was literally pounding with fear for them whenever they got into tricky situations. When Day first meets June he has no idea who she really is and vice versa. You could tell that there was a connection between them which would obviously complicate things for them both and I couldn't wait to see how they would react when they found out each other's true identity. I did keep forgetting that they were only fifteen because they both seemed very mature, I think perhaps the events of their childhood are responsible for this and in my opinion this would explain their maturity. The last few chapters were really tense and had me on the edge of my seat, there were a few shocks and some really sad moments that all added to the emotional atmosphere of the book. This was an engaging, action-packed story that I couldn't get enough of - I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.",Kate Verrier
9780141339603,"I was very excited to read Legend as I'm a huge fan of the ideas behind dystopian stories and this one has had rave reviews. I did enjoy it, but unfortunately not as much as I'd expected to. Saying that, the book was entertaining enough, had several good points to it and I would still like to read the sequel. I believe that the film rights to this book have been bought, and I do think that it has a very cinematic feel, maybe making this better off as a film. Legend is set in the urban setting of futuristic Los Angeles and follows two protagonists, Day and June. There is a war in America and Day and June are on opposite sides. June is a prodigy, a soldier who works with the Republic. Day leans more towards the Patriot side, he is a Robin Hood character who steals from the rich to give to the poor. He is also the most wanted person in the Republic. There is a plague that is ravaging the country and has infected Day's family. There is a lot more to the plague than a simple virus outbreak though, and several people come to realise this throughout this book. Whilst attempting to steal a plague cure, Day is accused of killing June's brother. June then makes it her mission to capture Day. The plot itself is interesting and there is a lot more to still be explored in the sequels to this book. I don't think that the plot was anything particularly new, at least not so far, but it'd be unfair to judge that just from the first instalment. There were quite a few similarities to other Dystopian books out there. The world building could've been stronger - The setting wasn't terribly clear and I would've liked to know more about the two sides at war and exactly why, but again, there is room for exploration of this. Lu does start to hint at some reasoning by the end of this book, which makes me anticipate the second book to really see what's going on. For me, the strongest aspect of this book were both Day and June. They both seemed to be strong characters and well formed. Day was loyal, brave and compassionate and June was a brave, self-determined character. I thought that they were both very likeable. Despite both having different views and upbringings, they were morally quite similar. They were also both logical and clever, though I think that they jumped to conclusions too often. I felt that the way that they worked things out so quickly and without much evidence sometimes weakened the book. Whilst we didn't learn all that much about other characters, including Tess (Day's friend), Matias (June's Brother) and Day's family, I thought that they were very solid and intriguing. What I didn't like about Day and June was the insta-love. As soon as they met, they seemed to fall in love, which seemed unrealistic and felt a little 'lazy'. There was certainly potential for chemistry between the two characters, and I did see some as they interacted. I do like the two characters though, and together they did work well. The fact that their relationship was forbidden added to the suspense. I do look forward to seeing how their relationship progresses later on. Legend is an action packed and reasonably fast paced book that I think the majority of young adults will enjoy. If you like a lot of action and perhaps a 'thriller' feel to your reads, you will probably enjoy it. Although this wasn't one of the best dystopian books that I've read, it was decent enough and I would like to see how the rest of the series pans out.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

9780007424832,"""I would always love Alaska Young, my crooked neighbour, with all my crooked heart."" I'm not quite sure where to start with this book. I read it in about a day, which is quite amazing, as my last two books have taken me about three weeks each. So that pretty much says how fantastic I found it. Everything is perfectly done. I love the layout of it, with the incident as the central point, showing us the hundred and thirty-six days before and after. I did guess what would happen, though I really didn't want it to. For some reason I seemed to know what the incident was before I even picked up the book. I'm not sure if I'd read it somewhere before and consciously forgotten it or something, I don't know. Still, it was heart breaking. At the start I was sort of worried because Miles sounded quite moan-prone, the kind of guy who doesn't appreciate the friends he already has (kind of like a male Bella Swan) but the narrative certainly improved from the beginning. I did actually end up really liking Miles, and his habit for remembering last words. I thought that was a great thing for the story to keep going back to. All the characters were awesome. The Colonel was just freaking fantastic, and Alaska is basically everything I would like to be. Except for, you know, the screwed up part. I think John Green captures all their voices incredibly well, pretty much perfectly. I love the backgrounds he gave to the characters too, and with them the reasons they were like they were. I could really feel Miles' frustration and sadness at the situation he'd been left with. I wanted for so much more to happen. With every day that was counted down I felt even more depressed, because I wanted to just keep reading about their time at school and the pranking and the stuff they got up to. That's the thing about Green's writing - even when not a lot is happening, it's still damn near impossible to put down. So I'm giving it the full five stars, mainly because of the kick-ass characters and how absorbing it was. It's one of those rare stories that, when you're reading it, you almost become it. Then when someone interrupts you you're kind of dazed for a few seconds because you don't really know where or who you are. You just get so lost in the characters. More than a coming-of-age novel, I see it as a coming-of-life novel, is such a thing exists. It doesn't matter that Miles is just a Junior. He could be any age and the same experience would probably shape him the same way. So really this book is for anybody. Probably for everybody. It really is quite a treasure.

9781471122668,"I really enjoyed this book, mostly because of how realistic the premise was. Ia??ve read a lot of YA contemporaries that are cute and entertaining but arena??t entirely realistic. Books where the characters go on these wonderful and dramatic adventures that arena??t really possible for most high school students. This book doesna??t fit into that category. Ita??s realistic. The adventures that Emily and her friends go on are adventures that your typical seventeen year olds could do. Thata??s why I enjoy this book so much. Ita??s a reminder that contemporary stories dona??t necessarily need to be dramatized or glamorized to work well. The tasks on Sloanea??s list arena??t ridiculous for teenagers to accomplish. Anyone could read this book and think If I want to be more adventurous, these are tasks I could actually accomplish. But outside of the whole premise part, I really liked this book. The writing was crisp. Emily was a great character. As were her friends. I think realistic is going to be the word I associate with this book because everything about it: her friends, her love interest, and the problems they all faced throughout the story were all realistic. Definitely put this book on your summer reading list, if you enjoy YA contemporaries. Ita??s light and fun (for the most part) and ita??s set in the summertime. These things just add up to the fact that Since Youa??ve Been Gone couldna??t be more of a perfect summer read. So what are you waiting for? Summer is upon us. Get going and read it. And maybe youa??ll even be inspired to create your own bizarre to-do list for a friend.",Ryann Dannelly
9781471122668,"My Summary: Sloane and Emily are the kind of friends you never see apart. For the past two years neither one has gone anywhere without the other, and the summer they have planned involved hundreds of sleepovers, mall trips, and days spent at the beach. But the first week of summer comes and goes, and Sloane is nowhere to be found. Leaving nothing behind but a list of thirteen tasks for Emily to complete, it seems as if Sloane disappeared into thin air. Without Sloane, Emily retreats back into her shell. What is Emily supposed to do without her best friend for the summer? And where could Sloane have gone? Then it hits her: if she completes the list, she may be able to figure out where Sloane went. What if Emily doesn't have what it takes to finish the list on her own? And what if Sloane doesn't want to be found? My Thoughts: I had so much fun reading this novel. Reading any of Morgan Matson's books makes me feel like I'm being told a story by one of my closest friends. Her characters are always extremely relatable, and she always catches and holds my attention from the very first page. I loved Emily, Frank, and Collins. And as we got to know Sloane through Emily's flashbacks at the beginnings of the chapters, you realized that she wasn't all that she presented herself to be. At first glance it appears as if the friendship between Sloane and Emily is one-sided - as if Emily needs Sloane around, but Sloane is indifferent - but the more you read, the more you realize just how much both girls needed each other, even if Sloane didn't outwardly appear to rely on anyone. This novel is one to look out for this summer. The moment I started I knew I wouldn't be putting it down until I was finished, and I was right. Without a doubt, one of my favourite reads of the year so far. Final Thoughts: I definitely recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys contemporary lit and to fans who loved Amy & Roger's Epic Detour as well as Second Chance Summer. A perfect summer read!",Stephanie
9780007466702,"THE ELITE continues the contest for Prince Maxon's heart with six girls left in the race. The remaining girls in the palace are Celeste, Natalie, Elise, Kriss, Marlee and America and there will be many challenges and public interviews to learn more about each girl, her feelings for Maxon and her strategy to outshine the other girls. Don't only imagine tiaras and smiles, these girls can bite. This sequel to THE SELECTION more or less follows a resembling scheme as Kiera's debut. Like the first book THE ELITE was a quick read. Towards the end the story even took a really surprising and welcome turn. One turn of events that I felt especially content with, because it added a new spin to the story and would open up many new perspectives for THE ONE. That Kiera Cass didn't strictly follow this new lead and made a backtrack in the end, left me a bit sour though. Of course now I'm hoping for THE ONE to be more offensive and present us with an even more curageous America than we've met in this book. There was a nagging feeling, a constant suspicion I couldn't explain, about Maxon and the entire royal family that something wasn't quite right about them and the entire competition. One thing is for sure, the royals are even more conniving than any real girls of a competition could ever be. Don't expect them to be as helpless as you first thought. The caste system is a thorn in every democratically-oriented reader's side. It's no wonder the resistance is growing steadily and it's acting more violently with each passing week. The rebels, North and South are agressive and the need to protect the girls and the royal family becomes more urgent. They start attacks that are extremely dangerous for everyone involved. Their movement and goals aren't transparent at all which poses as quite interesting since we've always supported the rebels' side in recent YA dystopians. I haven't read any other dystopian from the non rebels' perspective. America becomes stronger, too and - I wouldn't have thought possible- even more emotionally confused than in the first book. But why has America to be so volatile? Things about Maxon's past are revealed that even I as a Team Aspen girl, couldn't but thaw a bit. But this love triangle is slowly starting to get on my nerves. I am wondering if there can't be a trilogy with a love triangle, with the girl deciding whom she wants to be with in the second book so that we can actually enjoy a final couple interacting and growing together in the third book. That would be refreshing wouldn't it? America doesn't make that longed for final decision in THE ELITE, so we'll have to wait for THE ONE to find out what's in her heart and even more important how Kiera Cass intends to uproot the entire caste system and bring the resistance back in full force. I'll be awaiting THE ONE with high expectations. 3,5/5 ***/* THE ELITE - Less fairy tale and more rebellious and combative than any real princess comptetion could ever be. THE ELITE didn't send up as many sparks as THE SELECTION, because a more serious component is added to the story. The shiny facade of royal reign starts to crumble, friendships come apart and things- romantically on America's side and politically on the royal's side - get out of hand. It gets dangerous and also harder for America to stay on my good side if she continues her irresolute back and forth between Aspen and Maxon.",MissPageTurner
9780007466702,"This is going to be a tough review for me, be warned. Last summer I read The Selection and I loved it. I thought the whole idea of a story like this was really original. I loved that it was like The Bachelor put into a dystopian book. I saw a lot of positive reviews about it so I figured it would be positive for me too. So I had to read The Elite also of course and I must say (obviously) I'm rather disappointed by it. Actually a whole lot disappointed. I really wanted to like this book, more so than some others because The Selection was so good for me. Maybe I had to high hopes but I wanted to enjoy this. The fact that I didn't was a big disappointment because I just wanted this book to be done and over. And that's just never good with any book. I was so frustrated with pretty much everything and every character in The Elite. First of all, America. What was up with her? She kept running back and forth between Maxon and Aspen. It was literally one page she was loving on Maxon and the next she was crawling back to Aspen. Girl, no, just no. The whole book was like this. All about that stupid love triangle. I can like love triangles if they are done well but in this book it has got to be one of the most terrible I've ever read about. And what was up with her decision making? I could hardly follow her train of thought. Doesn't she think at all? At least the one thing that I didn't totally hate was how America was able to read Gregory Illea's diary. What a ******* he was. That's the only thing I want to know more about. Is the diary what the rebels are after or is it something else? I used to love Maxon to bits and pieces but this book ruined him for me. I didn't like him one bit. I guess that The Selection is some sort of game and Maxon has to be sure that he makes the right decision but please, I can't stand the whole thing. Dating all these girls, messing around with him. Ugh! No wonder America got so jealous. And really, Maxon, Celeste? REALLY? The only thing that's not totally awful is that I can sort of understand him a bit, with everything his father (who is a totally pyscho by the way) puts him through he wants distractions but there are other ways. I did feel sorry for what America witnessed at some point... Aspen still is some sort of vague character for me. He wasn't that much in the book but also not totally absent. He did some pretty nice things for America but after what happened to Marlee I can't understand why both him and America would take such huge risks. They are asking to get caught! And no, it doesn't mean that when I'm no longer team Maxon that I'm suddenly team Aspen. I can't pick any teams in this book because they both suck. I'm team America, get the hell out of there and work on yourself, please. The remaining girls in The Selection are definitely on my black list. Especially Kriss. I can't stand her. I get that America messed up and that suddenly Kriss and Maxon got close but it was all so awful to read about. And Celeste, I need her to leave already. There were some rebel attacks again. Wonder what that's about. It's awful but I'd rather read about them attacking the palace and have some action at least than America going back and forth with her two guys. Seriously. But even with the few attacks, we don't know anything. So yeah, frustration everywhere for every character. I was also quite disappointed with the author's writing. And I'm not saying this to bash her or anything. I don't even like giving a book this low a rating because I barely do that. But I couldn't get over it. I didn't like the writing at all. It felt rushed and I can't remember I hated it this much with The Selection. What happened I wondered. I missed action. A lot of them. You'd think because there are rebels, they should've been more of that than there was. Sadly enough it wasn't so. And I really disliked the ending. Literally nothing happened throughout this book. Nothing. I am so disappointed! At least the cover is beautiful and it was a fast read. Overall, The Elite by Kiera Cass was a huge disappointment. Everything from the frustrating characters to the lame plot to the weak writing, it all felt rushed. I wished I had liked it a lot more, but sadly enough I didn't. But I decided I will read the third book once it comes out because I want to know the ending. I hope it won't disappoint me again.",Stephanie Verhaegen
9780007466702,"Well... I regret reading this book now. Because now I probably have to wait way to long for the sequel! That's just mean! I want it! I want it now! *Ahem* I guess you could say that I liked this book. No actually I didn't like it. I loved it! It was everything I hoped it to be and more! So So So SOOOOO AWESOME! The story starts almost right after the first book and the characters I fell in love with (some more than I should) or grew to hate so much (*cough*Celeste*cough*) are still here and I'm sooo happy! In this book we learn more about the history of the land through Diaries from Gregory Illea and we see a bit of a darker side of it. We get to know the King and Queen more in this book, which was awesome. I love Queen Amberly, she's so nice! But I hate the King. I really do. Almost as much as I hate Celeste, that *peeeeep*. Bleh. America is still awesome, even though maybe a little more emotional in this one. I get that I was too. I was so torn and I am just reading the book. If I were America, I would be crying all the time. But she is still true to herself and never forgets were she comes from and she isn't afraid to fight for what she thinks is right. And I'm glad she has support from some people in the palace. Now why is she so torn? Guys of course... Maxon... Sigh. My emotions were scrambled up good in this book, and that's mainly because of him. First I still love him, than I don't like him so much, than I do, than I hate him, and in the end I loved him again. Yeesh... I mean... I get that he needs to find a wife, but if he really loves America, like he says, why kissing those other girls? Okay yeah, sometimes America is to blaim for that one to because she pushes him away constantly (something I don't understand by the way... I would never push him away), but come on Maxon... Kissing Celeste? Seriously? If I could I would kick you right in your royal parts. But I can't stay mad at him for long, so... And then there's Aspen. Yeah he's a douchebag but at least he is a one-woman kind of guy and he fights for America. Something I admire. And it's romantic... So you see why America is so torn? I certainly am... But I still think I'm team Maxon. Oh and I love her dad! He made me cry quite a bit in this book with those letters he wrote to America. Wish I had a dad like that. And Marlee... I'm soooo not going to talk about her. I'll cry again. So yeah, this was awesome. I loved it. I want the sequel.",Bieke Paesen
9780007466702,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins publishers and Netgalley.) This is book 2 in the 'The Selection' series, and picks up where book 1 left off. The 35 girls of 'The Selection' have been reduced to just 6, and it's time for America to not only work to keep her place in the game, but to also make a decision as to who she really wants to be with - Prince Maxon, or her childhood sweetheart Aspen The competition is also heating up, with some unexpected events, and more rebel action. What do the rebels want? Who will be sent home next? And who will America choose? Beautiful and captivating, this book had me from the very first page! I loved 'The Selection', and I was so excited to finally have a copy of 'The Elite' to read, and I really was not disappointed. America continued to be not only the underdog of the competition, but also the one who truly seemed to have captivated the prince's heart. Her heart seemed to be in the right place in that she was always doing what seemed right to her, even if the things she did endeared her more to the lower castes than the king. The romance in this book was quite sweet, but I really wanted America to just make a decision and stick with it! It seemed obvious how America and Maxon felt about each other, so the fact that he was off flirting with the other 5 girls in the selection, and she was still making out with Aspen was a bit annoying! I really wanted Maxon to just propose, and send the other girls home instead of them constantly seeming to play games with each others feelings. America also wore something which linked her to Aspen which for me was a really stupid thing to do, and the way she kept asking for more time was irritating too! I have to say that if America and Maxon don't end up together by the end of this series I will be really annoyed! I liked the storyline in this book, and although America was a little immature and indecisive at times I couldn't help but love this story. I don't know what it is about these books but I really love the way they are written, and I actually think that 'The Elite' was better than 'The Selection'! Overall; I really loved this book, and although America had her faults, I hated to put this down! Can't wait for book 3!!! I want it now!!! 9 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780007466702,"I flew through this one and enjoyed getting to see another side of all of the characters. This one did a much better job at elaborating on the other girls, and I really enjoyed that. I know it was impossible in the first because getting to know America, Maxon and Aspen, and of course, there were just TOO many other girl. Oh, America. She still needs time. I don't know why I am surprised by this because it is only the second book in the series, and of course she hasn't made a decision. I just feel for her heart as well as Maxon and Aspen, because someone is going to get hurt. I enjoyed getting to know Marlee more, and interested at her reasoning for why she doesn't think she and Maxon are a good match. I, of course, have some speculations, but wanted more events to unfold. Besides, I just like her and America's friendship. It is refreshing to read about with all of the politics and love triangle afoot. Not saying that I don't like the romance, and getting deeper into that, I just like that aspect as well. But oh, at the event that the synopsis hints at with the devastating loss--oh my goodness. I couldn't believe it and wished that there was something I could do to change it. It made me want to cry and scream. And while I can understand America questioning herself and what she thought was her choice, I just wanted to strangle her because she wasn't looking at the whole picture. I was so mad at her at times, because while I understood needing to get her feelings straightened out, and I am usually all for the forbidden love, I just didn't want for anyone to get hurt. And she was playing with huge fire still having feelings with Aspen, and the risks that they took in Selection alone were enough to be charged with treason according to the rules. I couldn't look away from the book though, and my heart was torn just like hers with each twist and thing that happens, but I know that I am rooting for Maxon overall, and I think that America could do great things with him for the nation. I am so ready for the next book in the series, and it is almost sad that I got the arc because now I have to wait longer... But I was immersed in this story and counting down until I can read more. Bottom Line: Emotional second book where America's choices only get harder.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780142410707,"This book was slow, nothing happened much but the day to day description of the main protagonist's life in his quest to find the formula which describes and may predict his relationships with katherines .the end conclusion was nice, the way he chose to write to it was blah. I struggled to keep reading , the story line wasn't engaging enough to keep me from putting it down time and time again.

9780142410707,I absolutely loved this book. I did a video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lev0foprhMc,Adrienne
9780142410707,"If you had the opportunity to devise a theorem that could correctly predict the outcome of a romantic relationship, would you do it? If it worked, would you use it? Can it even be done? This is the problem plaguing Colin Singleton, recent high school graduate, nearly-former child prodigy, hopeful genius. Colin, you see, has a significant problem. He falls in love quite easily, which in and of itself isn't such a bad thing. The fact that all of his loves, nineteen of them to be exact, have been named Katherine can even be explained away by some form of twisted scientific method. What can't be explained, though, is why Colin has been dumped by all nineteen of those Katherines. When he's dumped by the love of his life, Katherine XIX, he finds himself in a bad place. He can no longer call himself a child prodigy, since he's graduated from high school. He's not a genius, because he's never come up with anything that will change the world. There's an empty place inside of him where his latest Katherine's love used to live, and he doesn't know what to do with himself. Until Hassan Harbish (Muslim, but not a terrorist) devises a way to get Colin out of his funk--a road trip. With no destination in mind, the two set off in The Hearse, Colin's car, and go where the road leads them. Where it leads them is a small town called Gutshot, Tennessee, where Colin gets the urge to see the supposed grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. It's also where the two meet Lindsey Lee Wells and her mother, Hollis. Not to mention where they get to live in a giant Pepto Bismol-pink house on a hill, interview employees of a factory that makes tampon strings, and eat Monster Thickburgers at the local Hardees. It's also the place where Colin decides to finish the Theorem of Underlying Katherine Predictability. Assign numerical value to different variables, plot it on a graph, and you'll be able to predict how long a relationship will last--and who will be the dumper, and who will be the dumpee. Except Colin forgot some pertinent information, like chance, and distorted memories, and the fact that love is never predictable. As Colin and Hassan learn a few things about life in the small town of Gutshot, we get to follow their journey of learning to grow up, to make a name for yourself, and how to matter as a person. I loved AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES, even more than Mr. Green's previous book, LOOKING FOR ALASKA. That book won the prestigious Michael L. Printz award, and I won't be surprised if this book is nominated, as well. This story is funny, poignant, and informative. For example, if I hadn't read AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES I would never have known that: 1) Fetor hepaticus is a symptom of late-stage liver failure where your breath literally smells like a rotting corpse. 2) The junior senator from New Hampshire in 1873 was Bainbridge Wadleigh. 3) There is absolutely no scientific proof that drinking eight glasses of water a day will improve your health. 4) Dingleberries can be anagrammed into see inbred girl; lie breeds grin; leering debris; greed be nil, sir; be idle re. rings; ringside rebel; and residing rebel. 5) Nikola Tesla did a lot for electricity before Thomas Edison came along and stole some of his ideas, and he also loved pigeons. 6) I still suck at math. Order this book today. It's great, you'll love it, and you'll actually learn stuff. Three for the price of one! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780439895293,"This is one of my favourite books. If I were asked ""What book would you most like to see in every school library in the world?"" I would not hesitate to name this book. The illustrations are mesmerising, the storyline is human and heartwarming, and above all it is entertaining. Despite the lack of a single word (or even recognisable letter) the story is clear - it tells the tale of a man who flees a troubled land to find work in a new country, leaving his wife and child behind. Everything it strange and difficult, but he befriends other who have also fled from various troubles in their own home, and they help him to find a job and find his way through day to day tasks like shopping and taking some very unusual public transport. Eventually he establishes himself enough so that he can reach his goal - a stable home for his wife and child. Some of the illustrations could be considered scary (think dragons and giants with flamethrowers) and the themes are a little complex, so this might be better for older children even though it is a 'picture book'. But I would think most eight year olds would be able to handle it. I love this book. In fact, I might just go read it again right now!",Trowzers

9780141346113,"I'm having such trouble writing this review without being a huge fan girl. I always have this problem when I read a really good book - I can't wait to tell everybody about it, get really excited and then start gushing everywhere about how amazing this book is without actually saying anything of significance. This review probably won't make any sense... Above all I adored the characters in this book. Every single one of them. They were all different, they all played their part in the story and they all developed in some way or another by the end of the book. They were really well rounded characters that I felt I grew to knew over the course of the book. I loved how relatable they were and how they all had their individual flaws from not being confident enough to speak out to defend others to pushing people away because they feel they don't deserve them. They didn't stand still long enough for me to ever get bored of them and for those characters who did something wrong, it was always acknowledged which I loved. The plot was perfect for characters still in high school. It was all about identity and growing up like everyone does during those years. Everybody can relate to this story and learn from it in some way or another. I also loved how depression was explained in this book. For someone who has experience with it, I loved reading what comes after diagnosis and not just dealing with the start. A lot of people have to live with it for a long time so to have one of the main characters mention it quite a bit here and there was really refreshing. As usual I thought John Green's writing was amazing. It was the first time I had read something by David Levithan though and I thought he made another amazing Will Grayson. I loved the differences in the writing and how it reflected the personalities of the actual characters. Overall I love this book and it's definitely one I want to come back and read again and again. If you haven't read anything by John Green please give one of his books a go because you won't regret it. As for David Levithan, I can't wait to pick up another one of his books. The two authors complemented each other really well.",Maryam H

9781594744761,"Let me start by saying that, 1) I think the description of this book is a bit misleading, and 2) When I started reading it, I didn??????????C/??t know that it was the first book in a series. Because of this, I found reading Miss Peregrine??????????C/??s Home for Peculiar Children, well, peculiar. Jacob Portman grew up listening to the fantastic stories his Grandpa told of his youth; Tales of monsters and children with extraordinary talents. No matter how incredible they seemed, he always believed the stories to be true, until the day that he didn??????????C/??t. ??????????C/??We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing them becomes too high.??????????C/?? When tragedy strikes and Jacob happens to witness it, everything he believes is put to the test. Traveling to the place of his Grandpa??????????C/??s past, searching for answers to help ease his mind, Jacob learns that even the tallest of tales are sometimes based on the truth. I genuinely liked this book. Even though it wasn??????????C/??t what I expected due to the somewhat misleading description (I??????????C/??m not going to go into that though because I don??????????C/??t want to spoil anything), I really did like it. Had I known it was the first book in a series, I may have liked it even more. However, having not known that, I found the book to be a bit slow. I enjoyed Jacob??????????C/??s narration and I thought that the use of the vintage photographs to enhance the story was creative and at times disturbing (Hello Creepy Santa, please step away from those kids), but I felt that the story wasn??????????C/??t really going anywhere. It was interesting enough, funny in all the right places, and had a few elements that I didn??????????C/??t really see coming (so kudos for that), I just expected it to be. . . more. More creepy. More sinister. More action packed. But it wasn??????????C/??t. I felt like the story kept building and building, but nothing happened. . . until the last 60 pages or so, that is. The end of the book really picked up some steam and that??????????C/??s what finally reeled me in. Knowing now that the story will go on, I think Miss Peregrine??????????C/??s sets up a good foundation for the next book. The world has been built, the characters have been established, and the plot has thickened. I??????????C/??ll definitely be picking up the sequel when it comes out and I, for one, hope the next leg of their journey is anything but ordinary. ??????????C/??I used to dream about escaping my ordinary life, but my life was never ordinary.

9781594744761,"This book has an excellent beginning! I loved the writing style of the author and felt it easy to read, comfortable and casual. The book, however for me, took a turn I had a hard time following. Although the book started off great and mysterious, the whole business with monsters and wights seemed silly and underdeveloped. I must say, though, the photography was wonderful! I had a great time examining each photo that was described and imagining what life might have been like with these people. Something I've also noticed, as far as the book's physical aspects are, as opposed to it's contents, is that the paper is wonderfully smooth and has a great contrast and thickness to it. I never really gushed over a book's visual and physical aesthetics, but this book was excellent in that category. The book's a quick read (especially with all the photos) so if you're looking for something weird casual read, then by all means pick this up!

9781594744761,"This is one book that you can judge by its cover. The cover and dust jacket of this book are stunning, as is, most importantly, the contents. As well as gorgeous white pages and patterned chapter beginnings, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is scattered with genuine, eccentric and very distinctive vintage photographs. These are the real base for the story and it's interesting to see how Riggs managed to link them all together - I can imagine that this would've been a very fun plot to create. A couple of the photographs did feel as though they were forcibly stuck into the story, but I enjoyed looking at them all the same. I think that the chosen word for this book, peculiar, is very apt in all aspects. It is a very quirky and quite a unique book but although it is all so very strange, it feels natural to the story and there is no feeling that the author is trying too hard. There was some slight over description at points, but I never once got bored. I enjoyed sitting back and reading the descriptions of the Welsh island setting and also of all of the characters that Jacob, our protagonist, met. Riggs has a way with making everything feel eerie. There is a sort of fairytale like feeling to the story, but it is twisted and dark. As aforementioned, I never got bored of reading this book - there are enough twists and the action increased as the book progressed. There was not a whole lot of action during the first half of the story but I actually somewhat preferred the discovery of things rather than the fast paced events that took place near the end. I liked Jacob as a protagonist. He was imperfect and he felt real and as rational as anyone could be under his circumstances. We learned a few things about him, personality wise, as he tried to make sense of unanswered questions left to him by his grandfather who was killed. I particularly enjoyed reading about Jacob's relationship with Emma, his grandfather's old flame, but I thought it should've been more complex - Jacob only seemed to doubt the morality of it once. The children were also interesting, creepy and charming. I'm still left wanting to know more about all of the characters though, there is still a lot of room for development. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but if there is a sequel (which there is certainly place for) then I'd feel a lot more positive about it. I'd love to learn more and follow Jacob and the children on their 'mission'. This is an unusual, unique read and it is something that I'd definitely recommend for teens and adults alike.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

Most authors don't do this with photography but I thought it was different and definitely clever! The story line was great but... The ending made me feel a little disappointed and to be honest - a little sour! The way the story was heading - with loads of action and intrigue to then just stop.

9781594744761,"I've sat on this review for a little while because I wanted to let Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children sink in. And, if I'm honest, I wanted time to make up my mind about this book. It didn't work. Letting my mind breathe like a nice red wine has not allowed the flavour of my thoughts to mellow and mature. This book was like wine in a lot of ways, I guess. There was subtlety, complexity and richness. Furthermore, it was a book I could only sip. I'm usually all for swallowing books whole but I couldn't gulp at this one. And then there was the slight... bitterness. This book left a bad after-taste with me when I was done. Just like when you indulge in a few too many glasses of red, when I was finished with this I felt the face-palm of regret. I couldn't figure out why until I sat down to put my thoughts in line about this book. I regretted the fact that I didn't love the book as much as I had so desperately wanted to. Ransom Riggs' writing is interesting and I loved the premise of the story. Unfortunately, the only character I liked was the protagonist, Jacob. Everyone else in the story either got on my nerves a little bit or drove me completely nutty with annoyance! In some cases this annoyance came from the characters' qualities. The love interest, for example, (whose name escapes me...) was really irritating! Take that and couple it with the almost incestuous fact that she was Jacob's grandfather's ex (I know, right?) and this was a romance that just didn't float my boat. So many of the characters had such potential. There was one creepy li'l kid who could bring clay golems to life by giving them the hearts of living creatures. He was one of the few characters who had a bit more going on other than his peculiarity. In most other cases the peculiar children's little quirks were all they had. Their personalities weren't developed and there just wasn't much beneath the surface. The pictures were disturbing, even more so after the Afterword at the back of the book. These have me curious about Riggs' up and coming work, Talking Pictures. Other than these visual interludes, I found little else about the book creepy. So...where do I stand? Now that it comes to thinking about how many little stars to post below, I must admit that I'm a little bit stumped. This book has worked its way under my skin in spite of my disappointment with the book as a whole. I still want to read the sequel because there really is so much potential to this premise and these characters. I'm going to give this one a 3 star rating. A cynical little voice in my head is muttering that it should be lower. A bright little voice is chirping that it should be higher. Screw them both, I'm playing it safe and sitting my butt firmly on the fence!",Laura Williams

9780141345833,"The 5th Wave has received plenty of hype and advertising, and my biggest concern when I began reading it was that it was undeserved. And while this first book in a new series wasn't quite what I anticipated it to be, I was enjoyed it so much and I truly believe that all this hype is well-deserved. The 5th Wave reads like a great introductory book to science fiction and apocalyptic tales, because it's set in a world so very similar to ours just with an alien invasion taking place. But surprisingly, I didn't feel like that was the entire focus of the story which made it an even greater novel. Reasons to Read: 1. A fresh take on aliens and the end of the world: I typically enjoy reading stories in an apocalyptic setting, and I'm always intrigued by aliens because they always freak me out a little bit. I loved that Rick's aliens aren't your standard martian fare. They're eerie and disturbing, but also seem very plausible. It really struck me how real this story felt, which lends to its horrifying nature. And I appreciate that he used aliens to bring about the end of the world in The 5th Wave, because I love zombies and natural disasters but it's nice to read something different too. 2. A heartbreaking story of survival: Cassie is kinda like a more cynical, sarcastic Katniss. It's a fair comparison. I loved her sense of humour, which stood out even at the worst of times, and you could really tell how much heart and inner strength she has from her story. But her life is filled with so much tragedy and such difficult challenges, I can't even imagine being in her place. It really helped me connect with the book though, and I think reflected some of the more thoughtful aspects of the book. 3. Something for every reader: You want action? There's PLENTY of that. Crazy fight scenes. Tense excitement through the entire. darn. book. Teensy bit of romance? Just enough to appeal to those who love it, and distract readers from all the depressing deaths and dismal future. Super BIG secrets and plot twists? I kept trying to guess and I couldn't keep up! There are plenty of shockers, but they fit so well with the story. Plus there are a number of different characters featured, all different from each other and you're bound to find one you relate to or just prefer reading about. 4. Strong character relationships: I've noticed recently that one of my favourite things to read about in books are sibling relationships. I seem to connect really well with them, and I appreciated that Cassie's relationship with her brother was one of the driving plot lines in The 5th Wave. And to me, The 5th Wave is really about our relationships with other people and community more than anything else and that's why I found the book to be so striking. It's a struggle to connect with others, because of the setting, and it becomes increasingly obvious how terribly lonely this is for the characters. And how it just might very well be their downfall. I had a harder time with Evan as a character though, and I struggled with how conflicted my feelings were towards him. I have to admit I was always completely intrigued by him, although I didn't find him to be terribly surprising and I really hope we see more development for him in the next book. He was the kind of character I really wanted to like, and at times I did but there were others when I was skeptical... He's just a seriously complicated guy. And honestly, the book wasn't as scary as I had anticipated. It's dark and very disturbing, but it didn't thrill me the way I expected. That may not be such a bad thing, but I just didn't expect such an introspective type of read when I picked it up. But this is still exactly the kind of book I've been saying I want to see in the YA genre for a while now, and the release of this book is just so timely for where my tastes currently are in literature. I love creepy and exciting, and I love that Rick Yancey is such a talented author to pen this book. ARC received from Penguin Canada for review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats

Some optimists, like her father, thought they would be friendly. Why not? And then, the first wave arrived. No cell phone, no car... nothing than runs with electricity works. But the worst part is the planes falling from the sky. That was the day they first attacked. They all waited. Wait for what? It was like they have almost forgotten about what they were doing. But the second wave came and only the lucky ones escaped from it. The third, however, you could say the unlucky ones were the ones that survived. At least they didn't see their loved ones bleed until death and madness took them away from them. They thought they couldn't create more creative attacks, but they were wrong. The forth wave make no shame to the others. Knowing your grandmother could be one of Them or your father, your mother... create one unbreakable rule: trust no one. Now Cassie is alone. They took their brother, kill her father and make her mother bleed until death. She now lives with a gun in her hands constantly and a bag that is her home. She's been living ok, by now. She's still alive, so pretty much we could say she's the best in surviving. However, she needs to leave her safe spot. She made a promise and she has to make that happen. However, after been shot and taken care by a mysterious and gorgeous boy, Evan Walker, she starts to forget her unbreakable rule. She needs to stay alive to find her brother, but now Cassie has more problems than before. Now she's not alone. Review: We have to confess. Alien story? Not a Summer Read for us, at all. However, just watching the cover and reading the description of the book made us want to read and know more about this story. And we weren't wrong. This is totally and completely amazing. This story goes way beyond aliens and fights. It blowed our mind. While reading Cassie's point of view we were beyond amazed. We don't know how Rick Yancey did it, but he nails the main female character. Sometimes is really difficult writing about the other gender without leaving traces of your own. We don't really know how guys think or act or if there's an encyclopedia for that, but it seems that Yancey found the girls encyclopedia. The way Cassie thinks and acts and talks it's the normal behavior of a teenage girl. So while reading the book we couldn't stop thinking how the author did it to captivate us like he did. Cassie is a strong character. She's been running, surviving. At first she was with her family. Everything was falling around them, but at least she was not alone. Then her family starts to die. First her mother. It's horrible how she watches her dying, knowing there's no way to safe her. It's really sad, but she keeps her strength and her determination to keep her father and little brother alive. Then they stole her brother and kill her father and almost kill her. Like nothing bad has happened already to her. She keeps pilling up situations where the characters proves to us that she's even more strong than that, because she has a purpose in her life. It doesn't matter that the world is ending, that she may be the last teenage girl alive on Earth, she made a promise and that keeps her fighting back. We really like her attitude and we are glad to see that she kept fighting instead of surrender. It's true that, at first, the story goes slow. You need to know everything about Them and get to know what happened in the different waves to make Cassie act, think and behave like she does and why is where she is now. You kept wondering things, asking things to yourself, like why is she alone, who is the thing/boy/guy/something that is watching her, etc. It kind of feels like a drug. To unravel everything and to finally know Cassie's story and what the fifth wave is about. However, what makes this book different from the other alien-dystopian books is the four points of views in this story. Four different people that gives you a different insight into the invasion. As you can guess, one of them is Cassie. The other is Ben. We met him before reading his POV. He's Cassie's secret crush in High School back when everything was normal. We can see through Ben's eyes. He's in a sort of military camp training for a battle. You can see the change of his life after the invasion, what he thinks and what he feels. His POV's is important because is thanks to him that we know what the 5th wave is all about. Another POV's Sam, Cassie's brother. He's a little kid. He's expecting to see his father and sister again and its a little heartbreaking. He ends up in a military base with another character, Ben. They are in the same military squad and became ""brothers!"". It's really cute how Ben takes care of him. The last POV's Evan. Mystery Evan Walker. He's troubled. He's here to accomplish a mission and Cassie's making tumble his plans without her even knowing. The best part? He's the bad guy. The one Cassie should be running from and he should have killed Cassie the first time he saw her in the woods. But he did not. We knew from the beginning that he was lying. Shooting animals at night? Really? It's normal that Cassie's instincts where on fire with him. We didn't trust him, but wanted to. Badly! The story is not an expected one. It's not one of those stories that you know how the book is gonna end or what is going to happen or who is going to die or not (OMG, we need the second book. NOW). It's a great story with unexpected twist and unraveling secrets that would make you scream all the time. Like us. Just saying: OMG. Rick Yancey wrote an excellent novella and we are dying to know more about The Fifth Wave. We can assure you, Book Addicts, that you'd be captivated by this story. It would make you feel everything the author wanted you to feel while reading it. So, Book Addicts, don't doubt a second. Read The Fifth Wave. You're going to love it. And that's why it's in our highest ranking with five gorjuss dolls.",TUABFC
9780141345833,"5+ stars How can I describe a book with words, when there are no words to describe how fantastic this book was. From the first time I read the blurb of The 5th Wave, I wanted it. The earth has been visited by aliens, and they don't come in peace. And it's not like in the movies, where prominent cities are destroyed but we fight back with nuclear weapons and then we win, no the humans are losing. 7 billion of us are already dead, we're extremely close to becoming extinct, which is apparently, the plan. The 1st wave hit 11 days after the ship appeared above. After a 2nd, 3rd and 4th wave, the few humans who are left, are waiting on a 5th wave, with no idea what it's going to be. They've turned us against each other. The aliens are now in the guise of humans. There's one rule; trust no one! Cassie believes she may be the last human left on the planet. She's alone in the woods, believing her father and brother to be dead, her mother having been killed by the 3rd wave, an airborne virus, The Red Death. But a promise made to her brother keeps her going. With his teddy bear in hand, she won't give up until she finds him. Through flash backs into Cassie's past, we glimpse how she was affected by the previous waves. Sitting in school when the 1st wave came, not realising it would be the last time she'd ever see her best friend, her mother's death, leaving home with her father to search for other survivors, and maybe a safer place to survive. This book isn't just told from the POV of Cassie, though her's is the main voice, we also have the POV from Ben Parish, who was once Cassie's crush, but who has now been taken to an army barracks and trained to fight. And the POV of little Sammy, Cassie's five year old brother, who has been taken to the same place as Ben. There's also an interesting POV from a Silencer, the 4th wave, a silent killer, named Evan Walker. I enjoyed each and every one of these perspectives, but I always looked forward to coming back to Cassie. She is tough, she is snarky and sarcastic, adding a touch of humour to an otherwise dismal narrative. These characters are all doing what they can to survive this hopeless situation, but they aren't very optimistic that they will survive for too much longer. Yancey built the world around these characters flawlessly, easily going from past to the present, and voice to voice without affecting the flow of the story. I don't usually enjoy books that dip into the past and back again, but it really worked for me here. I loved how he effortlessly brought all these characters together at the end. Myself, I found the ending to be quite traumatic, and as I finished up reading this book, I was left with a feeling of despair. To say I loved this book is probably an understatement, if you haven't picked it up already, you really need to. It's my favourite book of 2013, so far.",Suzanne Finnegan
9780141441146,"It's incredible to think or imagine that, of the two most intense, passionate heroines of 19th century literature, both would be written by sisters of the same family. But this is, indeed, the case. With Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, and Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. You are drawn into a first person narrative that, from the start, is compelling and becomes more disturbing and troubling. Given the 19th century was a deeply moralistic society, at least on the surface, but one within and beneath which women as such had no identity or power beyond certain limited roles (governess, wife, spinster, etc.). But then you have Jane: Many things have been written about the character and the novel. As character, Jane Eyre compels you to understand very specific and certain imperatives (nowadays described as feminist - then, Bronte was alone in imagining it). She has an integrity embodied by her own ethics and morals; modes of behaviour and thinking that are radically established and challenging of the male-dominated status quo. Jane is effectively a radical heroine not only in 19th century literature, but all literature preceding it. To me, she is a proto-feminist, to be as much admired in the 21st century and all the more so when considering the society within which this book was published (under a male pseudonym, of course). She is truly herself, coping impressively with difficult, painful circumstances, not giving in to compromise that will threaten her own character or principles; speaking up for herself in situations involving the most appalling challenges, when they most matter; assert her independence of heart and mind; maintaining her integrity and self-respect against the odds. Jane Eyre as a novel signposted a revolution in terms of fiction writing and, in particular, challenged and questioned traditional attitudes and thinking about women and gave women an independence of voice and thought, and passionate determinism, not previously displayed. The only other novel that is as passionate, and as determined in thinking of the singular female self as Jane Eyre, is Emily Bronte's novel, Wuthering Heights, and her character, Catherine Earnshaw; yet Jane Eyre remains, through her novel, uncompromised of her own integrity and character, despite her circumstances et al. Catherine, according to Emily's narrative, is never given such a choice, or options of such freedom, i.e. independent female thinking. Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre is an astonishing novel: besides Wuthering Heights, by her sister Emily, it is one of the most passionate, intense, uncompromising, painful, and beautifully and intensely emotionally sustained novels of all literature. An astonishing achievement, irrespective of genre, author or century.",bobbygw

Not to mention Kerry, Bruce, Kyle, Lauren, Bethany, Jake, Gabrielle and the gangs! So many fun but dangerous missions to complete, so much tough training to do.

9781619630659,"This book reeled me in right from the start. Sarah J. Maas has upped everything about this story. It's incredible! Her books just keep soaring to new heights of amazing storytelling. The world building continues to be awesome! I love how the story branches out to these two new places. Let's start with Celeana's story, shall we? Her storyline is my favorite (but that's mostly because I'm obsessed with Celeana). Her character development in this book is so incredible. Let me repeat that, so amazingly incredible. I can't even describe how much character development she goes through. Ugh! So amazing. A part of that character development is her relationship with Ronan. I love that guy. Nowadays, you don't see a lot of deep complex and meaningful platonic relationships. That's exactly what these two have and it couldn't be more perfect! One of the best platonic relationships I've read in a long time! Then we have Dorian. Poor Dorian. The guy is just trying to survive, suppress his magic, and be happy. He can't seem to catch a break. I enjoyed learning more about how magic works. He has a smaller-ish role in this one, but he's being set up to be a powerhouse very soon. The next book is gonna' be pretty friken intense for Dorian. At points, I wanted to slap Chaol during this book. His big struggle is whether to be loyal to Dorian or Celeana. It takes him so long to realize that they're on the same side. A lot of that mentality comes from the way hd was raised, but it's still frustrating. What I really liked about Chaol's part was the introduction to Aideon. He is another great character to add to this mix. His devotion to his cousin is precious! I can see all the players of Celeana's court coming together. She's gonna' have a pretty intense court, if you ask me. Just don't kill anyone off, Sarah J. Maas! The other new plotline we get is Manon's. I really enjoyed getting to understand the politics of the witch covens. What's so interesting about the witches is that they're supposedly born evil, but we get Manon who's got some shades of humanity rising inside of her. I really liked how when all the witches pick their wyverns, Manon doesn't pick the biggest meanest one (like she should, since she's the head of her clan). Instead she picks the small beat up underdog (or underwyvern...). I can't wait to see how Manon's story mixes in with the rest of the crew. I can picture it now. The majority of the scary evil witches will side with the king, but I have a feeling Manon is gonna' switch over to Celeana's side at some point, taking with her the other thirteen members in her clan. Sarah J. Maas continued to build upon this incredible world. I'm excited to see where it goes (and really afraid for Dorian). The next book is the series is currently being written and I cannot wait for its release. It's now officially my most anticipated book release (although it's gonna' be at least a year...) Basically Sarah J. Maas has turned her story and her writing into a powerhouse in the fantasy genre. I could not have loved this book any more than I did. Can't wait to see where she takes it next!",Ryann Dannelly
9781619630659,"?C/??Because I am lost,"" she whispered onto the earth. ""And I do not know the way.?C/?? All marked spoilers are only from CoM. Heir of Fire is one of the best books I've read all year. It was action packed, heart wrenching, and beautifully written. I cannot even begin to describe how much this series has grown since Throne of Glass. The thing that's different about this book from the first two is that it's divided into three points of view. First being Celaena's story as she is trying to recover from her devastating heartbreak after Crown of Midnight. Celaena is truly my favorite female protagonist of all time. And I am not exaggerating that. Though she constantly blames herself for the deaths of her loved ones she is trying to ""not let that light go out"". In doing so, she begins to rise out of her pain, and own up to becoming a queen. The second point of view follows Dorian and Chaol's story back in the Glass Castle. Chaol now is trying to deal with the fall out of learning that Celaena is the lost Queen of Terrasen, making her his biggest enemy. And we follow Dorian as he deals with his terrifying magical abilities. This story line always made me feel very paranoid because any little damn thing that the characters could do could plunge the castle into hell. And by the end... I mean dear God... I was absolutely shocked and destroyed. It was so good. And our final point of view follows Manon (muh-non) Blackbeak of the Blackbeak Witch Coven. And while most people thought these chapters were uninteresting, I adored them to death. They were action packed and interesting. Learning about the life of the Witches was so enticing to see through the eyes of the savage and horrifically aggressive Manon. The basic plot is that we follow the Witch Covens join the King of Adarlan's army by giving them dragon mounts called wyverns. The Witches grow attached to their Wyverns and we realize how much of a threat an army of savage airborne witches will be to our main cast of character. Not to mention that there are ton of new characters that are truly amazing and I loved them all, especially the deranged Manon. I'm not going to tell you more about these characters because I want you to meet them for yourselves in this AMAZING BOOK. Heir of Fire is the best book in the Throne of Glass series and I cannot even begin to tell you how incredibly painful the wait is for the next book. ?C/??I wish you to become who you ???were born to be. To become queen.?C/??",Oscar Lopez
9781619630659,"I wanted to read Heir of Fire because I really enjoyed the first two and really wanted to know what would happen with Celaena next. I love her with Chaol, but I also liked the scenes with her and Dorian so I am a bit torn there. I miss Nehemiah right along with C and am very wary of her chasing revenge and what that will take her into. We meet some new characters in this one as well as getting a different look at some old faves. I don't remember the last books being 3rd POV but it works for this one because of how it is tying so many things together. Although we don't stay exclusively with C in this one, I tolerated the other views because it gave me insight into what is going on with Chaol and Dorian while she is off. Even though I skimmed a recap on Recaptains, I was still a bit lost. There was some really good and naturally incorporated recap in the first part, but I am just a little scatterbrained (okay, you got me, its a LOT) so I have a hard time with recall. It did effect my reading experience a bit for the first 10% or so and then I just kinda forgot or filled in pieces enough to really be immersed into the story. I admit though the witch POV in this one wasn't exactly my thing, but I did come to like her especially when the Abraxos wyvern plot came into play. Rowan. Wow, Rowan. He infuriated me at first, just as he did Celeana who others call Aelin because of the whopper that was the end of Crown. But as the layers came back some while he was working with her, I came to like him more and more. There was some chemistry at times between them I though and then other times it was more like brother sister bickering but also the connection. So, speaking of this... I think that Dorian is out of the picture based on the ending of last book, and I am totally not sure about her and Chaol because of the ending of Crown again, but as much as she thought of him, I would say that he's still in the running. So it is a love square, or I guess a triangle again, since we're not sure about Rowan if he's more of a bro or possible love interest. I hope that this is solved, but another part is kind of savoring the build up. A lot happened in this one, throwing more monkey wrenches into the plot but other things are starting to come together. Though I know this is only the third book out of 6 possibly 7, so that would account for some of the moving parts that are setting up instead of giving us revelation or answers just yet. And holy explosive ending. So much happened, some of which left my mouth dropped to the floor and other that made me want to cheer because of the character growth and how they started to stand up for themselves, or begin to see the light about certain events and their responsibilities. I will be continuing this series and can't wait to read more. Hopefully with a bit more recap next time, lol. Bottom Line: A bit harder in beginning to get into, but fell for Celeana plus other characters again.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

9781619630628,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (UK & ANZ) and Netgalley.) This is book 2 in the 'Throne of Glass' series, and picks up a couple of months after the end of book 1 'Throne of Glass'. **Warning - some unavoidable spoilers for book 1 'Throne of Glass'.** 18-year-old Celaena is now working as the King's assassin - finding people, killing them, and returning their heads to the king as proof of her work. At least that's what everyone believes. Instead Celaena has been faking people's deaths, and returning heads from the sick houses to the king. If he finds out though, he will kill her. Now Celaena has been asked to kill someone she knows, who is suspected of being a traitor to the crown. Can Celaena keep faking people's deaths? Should she help Princess Nehemia instead? And what more can she learn about the Wyrd marks? This was an okay read, but I expected more. Celaena was once again a strong character, but I thought that she maybe let things get on top of her a bit too much in this book. I loved the parts where she went bad-ass, and totally wiped the floor with certain people, but the bits in-between were just a bit disappointing. I wanted her to stay bad-ass, but that just didn't happen, and she wasn't quite as in control in this book as she was in the first. The storyline was okay, there were some creepy moments, and some things that I didn't see coming, but I wanted more excitement. There was an event just over half-way through that I really liked, but most of the story just felt a little slow, and I found that it took me a long time to get through it because it just didn't make me want to keep reading. The romance in this one was at a minimum really, although there was a big development in the love triangle. There wasn't the sort of forbidden romance and flirting going on that I remembered from the first book unfortunately. The ending was okay, and there was quite a big revelation at the end that I wasn't expecting. I had gotten a bit bored by this point though, so I didn't feel like the revelation really had much of an impact for me. At the moment I'm really not sure whether I even want to read the next book in the series, which is such a shame because I loved the first book. Overall; a disappointing second instalment. 6.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781619630628,"Given it has been a bit from reading Throne of Glass, honestly all I remember was that I loved it, Celaena was kick ass and I adored her, and there was a love triangle that I liked and I think I was rooting for the underdog. All my recollection from before I began, but it quickly came back to me. Celaena is tough, smart and witty, and I admired her. She goes about everything in such a calculated manner, and she has this ability to see and treasure the good, and have no limits for injustice. I couldn't believe but thought it was exactly like her in the ways that she was defying the king. I knew that she was walking a very narrow road, but admired her all the same. I honestly had forgotten about the Elena theme from the last one, but it also emerged in this one, and I enjoyed that storyline as it challened Celaena even more. I loved Chaol even more in this one. It is becoming apparent to even Dorian how much he cares for Celaena, and he can't stand it when she is off on the dangerous missions for the king. He wants to protect her and wishes that the line drawn by his position and hers wasn't there. But I lived for their stolen moments, of how steamy it can even be for him to just hold her. It is touching how he cares for her so much he just wants to throw caution to the wind, but I am glad that he is smart about it. Dorian was present in this one, but thankfully wasn't really a factor into the triangle like in the first, but he is there as a friend to Celeana when she needs one the most. He stepped up in many ways, but still has a long way to grow as royalty. But he is harboring a secret in this one that I had no inkling would happen, but it means big things. I will say that Sarah almost made me cry, and def shocked me at some of the turn of events that happened. There were so many twists in this one, things that I never saw coming, and that I am still even at the end, not sure exactly what the implications will be but I know that I can't wait to find out. The climax and ending left me breathless and wanting more from this beautifully written novel with so many layers.

At first, it may seems boring and slow paced but then, its all there. The actions, the relationship between Day and June, the mystery of the Republic. Its all so captivating! I love Marie Lu's writing style. I love how her describe the characters. And finally, at the end of the book, it breaks m heart. To pieces. And i was moping around in my room 30 minutes after i finished that book. Good Job, Marie Lu. Good Job on breaking my heart.",Rizka Safira
9780141339573,"Favourite Quote: ""Love is illogical, love has consequences."" I loved Legend so much that I couldn't wait to read Prodigy, I had such high hopes! However I was let down, and I only give Prodigy 3/5 stars. The main problem I had with this book was the characters. I wasn't a huge fan of June in the first novel but she was okay, in this book she is just spoilt, stubborn, selfish, jealous and immature and has no idea what the hell she's doing, I really don't like her anymore. As for Day I loved him in the first book and I still did until halfway through Prodigy and then I only liked him, he become obsessessed with June and the whole insta-love thing is just so annoying, I feel like Day characters only revolves around June. As for romance between the pair, urgh I just hate it. HATE IT. The are just not right for each other in any way, I see no attraction or chemistry. There were times in this book were I thought Marie Lu was finally ending the pairing but no it's still going on. I still much prefer Day & Tess together!!!!! As for the plot, I found it quite boring until the last quarter, then it became interesting with a few twists and turns. The was definitely a cliff hanger involving Day's character but I feel like that will all be resolved in the final book. Overall Prodigy was disappointing but still a good read, and I will be continuing with the series.",brookexx
9780007466719,"I wanted to read The One because I enjoyed the other two. The selection process has been hard, and I have seen a lot of change in America. The love triangle and some of America's lack of decisiveness when it comes to her preferred man has been on my nerves a bit, but the first two were still addicting to me and I grew to like Maxon more and more, and saw the desire to be a princess and future queen bloom in America and then see the ideas for chance that she had. The One didn't let me down, and I really enjoyed her journey. There were so many times when I thought that her rash decisions, or her strength and desire for justice to be done were going to the the end of her quest to the crown. I also loved the tension between the two of them. America and Maxon both kept some secrets and didn't want to fully express their feelings, and while I understood where they were coming from and their reasonings, it was still hard because I just wanted them to be together and happy. America had some big losses in this one, but she's grown a lot, and amassed quite the fans and followers. As well as making friends with her maids as well as some other unexpected people who make a return appearance. The friends that she made within the other Elite were unexpected to me, and some sage wisdom from the queen helped to actually bring them together, which in some ways, made their quest even harder but others easier, because they had someone who understood them on their sides, and closest to ever walking in their shoes. The ending wrapped things up in the way that I'd hoped, and brought about some changes that I wasn't quite expecting but it gave me a lot of hope for America, Maxon, Aspen, and the others that I came to care about. Bottom Line: Good ending to addicting series.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780007466719,"OMG. I don???C/??t even know where to start with this one. I am an emotional wreck after reading this book. An absolute wreck. America was herself to the best of her ability again in this book. She did make some stupid decisions at times, but I was nice the way she managed to uphold her integrity, and it was nice to see the way she realised her feelings for Maxon, even if she wouldn???C/??t share them with him! Maxon, was just, ahhhhh, Maxon ???C/????! Loved him! (Although I have to say that continuing to snog other girls when you???C/??ve pretty much made up your mind is infuriating!) The storyline in this was pretty good, although I did feel like there was a bit of a slow patch in the middle. We had loads going on in this book though ???C/?? rebel activity, secret bargains, possible moles, death, destruction, assassination attempts, lots of changing of minds, lovey-dovey scenes, angry scenes, ???C/??why won???C/??t you tell him?!???C/?? scenes, ???C/??What are you doing?!???C/?? scenes, ???C/??You???C/??re going to get in trouble for that!???C/?? scenes, ???C/??will you hurry up and do it already?!???C/?? scenes, and finally, finally, finally ???C/?? a wedding!!

9780761463276,"From the get-go, the mood was tension filled and dark in a post-apocalyptic setting. Though, how the world fell into chaos and ruin in just a matter of six weeks is a little confusing. But, the setting, as it is described, is not overly detailed, but just right and beautiful. The book is based after the invasion of angels. Angels. ******* genius! I love how Ee twisted the notion of 'good' angel into something that humanity, in the book, couldn't believe or handle. Maybe that's why civilization fell so fast. This story is not just depression dominated, but it has witty and humorous dialogue. I'm not one to laugh often while reading, but I definitely was with this book. The action is phenomenal and never weakened as the book progressed, and the climax literally had me setting the book down to calm myself. On analysis, the characters are very well developed, realistic, and funny. On some level, I want to connect with the characters and learn about them through little things, like minor details and habits. Penryn, the heroine, is one of the most badass, unique, and strongest female characters I've ever read. And her relationship with the male hero, Raffe (An angel who had his wings sliced off), is not an instantaneous, cheesy romance that would make me want to gag. I like for the action, conflict, and resolution to take the lead, and THEN the romance can be slowly developed. Plus, I loved the ending. It was perfect. It's what every post-apocalyptic book should have: cannibalistic, demon children experimented on by angels. It's the most perfect idea EVER. On the other hand, my heart broke for Paige and Penryn. It was the most saddest, yet clever plot twist. I honestly never expected for Paige to come back, ever. Especially as a cannibalistic demon child. And then the mother was perfectly added in for Penryn to deal with in this crazy world, though I was a little concerned about Penryn's lack of concern for her. Even if my mother was mentally ill and twisted, I'll be ******* losing my mind if I didn't know her exact location. Another element I loved about this book is the knowledge the author had on angels, fighting skills, and survival skills. Angelfall is action packed, sick, twisted, humorous, and I loved every part of it. 5 out of 5.",Red
9780761463276,"Once in a while, a book sparks my interest without me even knowing about all the hype. I read the synopsis and entered to win a copy from the fabulous duo at the Fantasy Floozies Blog. And I won it!!!! Thank you Kenya and Alicia! Took me a while to finally pick it up. It kept getting recommended to me, so I decided to just read it already! And once I started it I was intrigued. I was in a sort of post apocalyptic world, obliterated and forever changed by Angels, no less. Who ever thought of Angels as the enemy??? But even though the story line was already interesting, the beginning was a little so-so, and I was not immediately blown away. BUT... I was in for such a surprise. The moment Raffe falls from the sky, and gets his wings cruelly cut off in the middle of the street, I was HOOKED!!!! This book just turned into a messy ball of awesome. It had everything I wanted and more. Great writing and imagery. The post apocalyptic thing is just right up my alley. Angels are now my new favorite thing. Not to mention a kick ass survivor of a girl, Penryn. Chuck Norris would be jealous really. A complex world that really makes your head spin because it is such an original setting, with such intriguing characters. A forbidden love. Sacrifice, loss and hope. Super creepy lab experiments where kids are not exempt! Monstrosities that may give you some nightmares for sure. (Takes breath.) It was just fantastic. Blew my expectations totally out of orbit. Can't wait to read the next one. It really can't be published fast enough for my liking!",Lily
9780761463276,"This is a great book and will appeal to most book lovers. I enjoyed the action, blossoming relationships and the gentle touch on mental health, disability and religious practices. It had as much to teach us as it did tell a story and the author went beyond and touch on subjects most YA/Fantasy books wouldn't even mention. I loved the different perspectives on the world through each character's relationship to each other and how through their bond to each other they don't give up hope on one and other. I definitely recommend this book to all and hope this review helps you with your decision. Please rate this review as it really helps:)",Sarah Martin
9780761463276,"Favourite Quotes: ""No problem,"" he says. ""Shouldn't be too hard not to move around as we run for our lives."" If I'm being honest I never had an interest in this book until I saw Giselle at Book Nerd Canada talking about it in her youtube video! She loved it and I usually like the same books are her so I thought I'd give it a shot! And omg I'm so glad I did, it was soooo good, blew my expections out the water! I read it in one setting and I give this book 5/5 stars! The plot was so action-packed, there was hardly any down-time and this kept me hooked! The last quarter of the book was so horrifying that I was sitting mouth gaping while reading it! However I do wish there was more world-building, I'm still confused over how everything happened but I hope this will be fixed in future novels! This was a unique take on angels though it did remind me of L.A Weatherly's Angel series but I feel this book was so much bette than that series! As for the characters I really loved the main character Penryn. She was strong, determined, loyal, a fighter and her love for family just made it so easy to connect with her. Then there's Raffe who I also loved, he was the perfect love interest for this type of novel though the romance felt rushed a little, not insta-love but something close to it! however that did not put me off these book! Other characters were very interesting like Penryn's mother she was a loose canon who always made the plot line interesting, then theres the twins from the human camp (who reminded me of the Weasley twins) I thought they were awesome! All the other angels played a good role in this book as well! Overall I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an action-packed, suspenseful, post-apocalytic book!",brookexx
9780761463276,"(Source: I won a digital copy of this book.) 17-year-old Penryn is busy trying to keep her mother and sister alive, in a dystopian world in which angels have killed a huge percentage of the human population. When a fight breaks out among some angels on the road, Penryn's interference leads to her crippled younger sister being kidnapped by the angels, leaving her to try and rescue her. Caring for the only angel left behind, Penryn tries to aid him, in order to question him about where her sister will be taken. Raffe's wings have been severed though, and he's not in the mood to talk. Eventually though Raffe and Penryn come to an understanding, and together they travel towards a city where angels have taken over. Can Penryn rescue her sister though? Why are the angels kidnapping kids? And can Raffe ever hope to get his wings back? This story was unlike any angel book that I have ever read before, and I'm still not really sure how I feel about it! Penryn was a girl who was just doing her best to keep her family alive, and wanted more than anything to rescue her sister. This was especially important to her because her sister was wheelchair bound. Penryn's mother was a schizophrenic, and off her meds. I found it really weird the things that she did, especially the weird things that she collected - like rotten eggs. I also found it really creepy the way that she always seemed to be one step ahead of Penryn, so that even when Penryn did something that might not have been expected, her mother had already been there! Raffe was a strange character. He seemed to have little respect for humans, but did go out of his way to keep Penryn safe, almost as if it went against his better nature! I did feel sorry for him having his wings cut off though as that couldn't have been easy for him. I liked the storyline, although I thought the second half of the book was better than the first half. This wasn't like any other angel book I have read before, and I'm still not really sure how I felt about it! The idea of the angels being violent, and actually killing humans was a bit of a strange one for me. I did have a lot of questions with this book at first. I didn't really get why the angels would kidnap Penryn's sister, or why they'd keep her alive. Some of these questions were answered at the end, but we were still left with questions, and a cliff-hanger ending. Overall; this was a really different angel book that is probably worth a read. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth

I hated the main character at the beginning, but she became bearable as the story progressed. Some side characters were interesting as well, and the bit of romance present was very bittersweet.

For the first published book of Lauren Oliver, it struck home. Samantha Kingston is your typical popular high school student. Only, she died and is now re-living the day she died over and over again, struggling to get it right. Sam has the perfect balance of bitchy and humanizing moments to make her seem like a real person, and cause the reader to reconsider stereotypes and appearances. While it may seem like a teenage version of Groundhog Day, it is not something to be looked over. The novel is so touching, funny and memorable, I found myself crying for the characters and hoping that they'll be all right. Most of all, this book made me want to really experience life in the way that Sam learns to. The ending takes your breath away, and leaves you feeling oddly content but hollow. It's a book that makes me want to live.",Amy O'Brien

9780141337111,"First of all, you must know that Richelle Mead is my favourite author ever! I totally love her writing and her stories are always pretty amazing! Bloodlines is a spin-off serie of Vampire Academy - which is my favourite serie so far. But this time the narrator is not Rose, but Sydney. After the surprising ending in Last Sacrifice I couldn't wait to read the spin-off serie to see what will happen with my favourite characters. So Sydney gets send in Palm Spring where she will be attending high school with Princess Jill and guardian Eddie. Adrian is staying close to them, although he doesn't go to school. And so the story begin. The story was great, although I missed more action. In the end there is some, but I remembered certain things being more terrifying. It may be because the narrator is Sydney instead of Rose who was full of passion and adrenaline. If you don't mind that, then the story is pretty great. There is a lot of mystery, so it keeps the book interesting and unputable down. Honestly, I've read it in a day (well, and night) - I didn't sleep at all until I finished ;) Sydney is in a way a pretty amazing main character! Sometimes thing are a bit weird, because Sydney doesn't know much about, lets say magic, but nonetheless is good. I've found Vampire Academy more dynamic, but then again Sydney isn't Rose Hathaway. Also considering, is quite normal that there was more action at St. Vladimir with vampires and dhampires than in Palm Spring high school with humans. And then the most important thing.. I would have never, ever believed that one day I will read a book of Richelle Mead that won't include at least one kissing scene in the WHOLE story. That was a bit shocking. I mean, seriously. I missed that like oxygen in my lungs while reading Bloodlines. So yeah, the book was pretty good! It's just that I think maybe I've been expecting more.

9780141337111,"Bloodlines is the first in a spin off series from Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead. Lissa has become Queen of the moroi after discovering she had an illegitimate sister, Jill. Now, Jill's life is in danger from moroi who dont want Lissa to be Queen. By killing Jill, Lissa will have no living family and therefore must abdicate her thrown. While Lissa is trying to change this law, Jill is sent to hide out at boarding school in Palm Springs. Alchemist, Sydney Sage, is sent to protect her, along with Eddie, her guardian and Adrian Ivashkov. Personally, I found this to be a bit of a let down or maybe I was just looking forward to it too much and was expecting more. However, Jill and Sydney were not two of the most exciting characters in Vampire Academy. I did feel that Sydney's character grew a lot here and I look forward to seeing what is in store for her in the second book. Maybe some romance which this book had none of and I love a little romance in my books. Jills character remained dull and boring leaving me to wonder at all the male attention she receives. I absolutely LOVED Adrian in Vampire Academy and was looking forward to seeing what became of him in Bloodlines but he just didn't have the same charm and appeal here. I would still recommend reading this book and the second in the series looks to be promising as there were a few questions left unanswered here.

I have to say I was not very much disappointed , although I didn't get a great dystopian book, I still got a very engaging action packed story to delight myself with and well, that was enough for the time being. Why I say that this is no dystopian? Well, although there is a little of world building and it's not bad at all, it didn't have the most important thing a book of this genre must have, a sense of despair. After all we are talking about a dying society on the pick of coming back alive, there was not that political or moral sense to it, the struggle seemed just empty and not enough. The beginning, specially faction wise, it's quite confusing and not very well explained, that being said I say this book lacks a lot of explanations overall. Other than that I must say the action it's perfectly described and that the author has an amazing hand for fight scenes. Although I didn't fell in love with none of the characters on this plot I still had the need of following the story through. It's one of that books that keeps you hanging on, very movie like( maybe that was why Summit signed ).

I was pleasantly surprised to find that this contained so much more than I was expecting, including Miyazaki's storyboards. His original concept sketches of the characters, backgrounds and settings are as beautiful as the result, and offer a glimpse into the mind of the creator. There are nearly 200 pages of scenes from the movie in sharp, rich, glossy colour and following the storyline from start to finish. The presentation leaves nothing lacking, it's clean and each scene is accompanied by the matching concept art, sketch and final print. All scenes are captioned, and often include notes and comments from the Studio Ghibli artists and animators explaining how they achieved the artistic effects that Miyazaki was looking for. There are also some beautiful prints of the Japanese promotional poster here as well.

9780141337166,"The Indigo Spell the book we've all been waiting for since that swoon worthy kiss was absolutely and completely mind-blowing! It was a serious page turner, from the minute I sat down and started reading I knew from the very first paragraph, that Richelle Mead had delivered a spectacular read that made me feel soooo many emotions I didn't think possible. Mead had me from screaming into my pillow from to0 many emotions then a complete turnaround in other scenes where my heart felt too much for the characters that it was actually throbbing. It's safe to say that The Indigo Spell do not disappoint at all, becoming my favorite book out of the Bloodlines series. The story picks up after a few weeks of that forbidden kiss that had so many of us cheering for. Sydney and Adrian's relationship developed ALOT in The Indigo Spell we see how determined Adrian is at winning Sydney's heart even if Sydney the girl of his affections can be very frustrating and stubborn at times, oh and let's not forget denial. Nevertheless the romance is off the charts. It was burning the house down hot and so steamy that it had me giggling. It's fair to say my sydrian feels were put through alot and I still don't know if I'll ever recover. With the banter and chemistry they have... I don't think my odds are in my favor. I was proud of Sydney in so many moments and scenes in this novel. I think she finally evolved into the person who she was finally meant to be. We see this through her questioning the Alchemists rules and motives and finding out shocking revelations that rocked her to the core. Honestly I think this whole novel was about Sydney becoming this person she needed and wanted to be. Sydney questions everything to find out the truth no matter the cost, she constantly put herself in danger to protect the one's she cares about even if that meant coming around to her magical abilities which appears alot throughout the novel, as it becomes essential to the plot line. And now onto the amazing, charming, witty, lovable, extremely attractive Adrian Ivashkov *sighs* There's really not that much to say that I haven't already stated above. Adrian was fiercely loyal and dedicated to Sydney, always trying to protect her and her honor! I didn't think I could love him anymore but I guess I'm mistaken. I wish I had a guy who loved me as much as he loves Sydney! That girl is so lucky! Adrian has really matured, well, as much as Adrian can. His still that same charming and funny guy but you could see the subtle changes from the Adrian who was in love with Rose to the Adrian who's now madly in love with Sydney. I can't quite put the exact change down, but I think it's how he carries himself, more self assured of who he is and what he want's. Which is Sydney, the reason for his change. Marcus Finch! At last we get to see who this mysterious ex-alchemist is. And I can most certainly assure you that Marcus does not become a competitor for Sydney's heart. He's just a harmless flirt, nothing to worry about here guys! However we do see some intense moments between Sydney and Marcus were some alarming information is revealed about the Alchemist. I want say more on that due to spoilers. Eddie, Jill and Angeline were a delight to read! Always very light, usually nothing very heavy going on with those characters. I find it very enjoyably whenever we got a moment with one of them. It's hilarious to watch the drama unfold with those guys! Especially with the unknown love triangle happening! That certainly played a big cared in their day to day routine. Expect unexpected twists here! I'm sorry for this insanely long review but I could just gush about this book all day! If you haven't yet stepped into the Bloodlines world I seriously think it's about time that you do. The Indigo Spell was one sensational roller-coaster that I would not want to miss! Richelle Mead crafted one dazzling read here and I cannot wait to The Fiery Heart to see how this marvelous story continues.",Taylor Weeks

9780552561730,"Who doesn't love to read a story about boy and girl, love and hate, angel versus demon? If this sounds like the sort of book you'd like to curl up with on a couch, then Fallen, the first book of the series with the same name, is the book for you. Raised in Dallas and schooled in Atlanta, author Lauren Kate finished her M.A. in Creative Writing at UC Davis, where she also teaches. Her books have been translated into over thirty languages. She lives with her husband and currently works on the final book in the Fallen series, Rapture. Fallen is a story of seventeen years old Lucy, whose boyfriend died in unknown circumstances. As a result of this accident she must go to a juvenile detention educational facility - Sword & Cross School. When she enters the institute, she realized how much her life will change. Cameras watch her every move and discipline is strict. Just like her, it seems that other students have also their terrible secrets. On the first day she meets Arriane Alter, and both girls stick together and become good friends. When she meets Daniel, a brilliant student, her new life seems to get easier. She falls in love with him. This is where things get strange. Daniel is a fallen angel, he is in love with Lucy and every seventeen years he must re-suffer her death. Lucy seems to be immortal; she dies every time they meet, and is then reborn as a normal girl. However she doesn't remember her previous lives. Daniel is not the only fallen angel in the school. On her first day she met Cam, a handsome young man. Cam, like Daniel, is a fallen angel, however she does not know that both of them are the standards on the opposite sides of the ancient war of good versus evil. During her short time at Sword & Cross, Lucy must choose between finding out the truth that Daniel, Cam, Arriane and a whole bunch of others are hiding, or fighting for the love that she has felt ever since she saw Daniel. Fallen is a romantic and fantasy novel with elements of horror. From the beginning to the end the story is captivating and exciting. The main protagonists of the book are two teenagers. Fallen is mainly book for teenagers, but also more mature readers will find in it something for themselves. The setting of the old cemetery and the historic buildings of the school give an air of mystery to the whole story. The heroes in this novel are outcasts of society. Fallen angels, guardians of the innocent on the one hand, and dangerous warriors on the other. In these days, when the theme of vampires is almost worshipped, the idea of portraying fallen angels is a guarantee of success. I can strongly recommend this book to a fans of fantasy stories, such as, The Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer or The Mortal Instruments Saga by Cassandra Clare. After reading Fallen, there still is a certain hunger in us, questions haven't been answered, mysteries still abound. We are inexorably drawn to read the next book in the series - Torment. Find yourself a copy of this book and a comfortable sofa, and clear your weekend schedule.",Dr.Oasis
9780552561730,"My review: Since the fourth and last book in the Fallen series is about to be published in June 2012, I thought that I would start with the series! Since this book has been on my TBR list for a while, this review will also be part of TBR Pile 2012 Challenge. I have admired the covers of Laren Kate's books! The cover of Fallen was also something that caught my eye first, long before I purchased the book. I have followed the reviews of the three books which are out already and I am happy that I finally read Fallen. It is the first book of Lauren Kate's book which I have read and I enjoyed it. The book is written with a nice pace, the story rolls out intriguingly while reading and the characters are captivating. When you add surprises in the plot and a twisted romance story, then you'd get Fallen - amazing book. It was fun and easy to read and I read it in one sitting. Regarding the plot: The story starts out with the scene from 1854 and that immediately caught my attention. Right after that the reader was brought to the present, to year 2099, to a closed school named Sword & Cross School. The main character Luce is sent to Sword & Cross due to her different behavior in her childhood and the suspicion of her involvement in a murder of her friend Trevor. Everything is different in Sword & Cross, especially the students - they all have some criminal or mysterious backgrounds. During the first day in the new school Luce sees a boy who seems so familiar, but she cannot place him. Daniel, who is good looking, has beautiful eyes and is attracting Luce towards him, turns her down. It seems that he has no interest in Luce. Luce quickly find her some new friends who are very different from her friends back at home, but nevertheless, she creates friendships with Penn, Arriane, Cam and others in the school. Still, she is intrigued by Daniel and cannot understand why he is friendly in one minute and then minute late can be cold as ice towards her. Step by step Luce and Daniel are coming closer to each other. Luce starts finding clues about who Daniel is thanks to Penn and she finds surprisingly also a lot about her own past. I really loved the story: it surprised me several times with its twists and turns, the characters were very enjoyable and very fresh perspective to angels, especially fallen angels. I also enjoyed the surroundings of Sword & Cross School! Regarding the characters: Besides the captivating narrative, the characters were really well-written and intriguing in Fallen. Both main characters and many supportive characters had spark, boldness and they all had their stories to tell. Luce is a beautiful and smart girl who just has some abilities that causes her trouble. She sees shadows and other things which other people cannot and that makes her life complicated. She is persistent and wants to know who Daniel is. Daniel is one of my favorite male protagonists of the YA books I have read in 2012! Daniel is good looking, smart, independent and different from others. He seems to have this bad-guy attitude around him, but he is always there when Luce needs him. I absolutely adored two supportive characters in Fallen: Arriane and Penn. These two girls where so different, yet I really enjoyed their characters. Both of the characters had a big role to play in Fallen and their stories took an interesting and unexpected turn to me. When reading Fallen, you cannot be untouched by Cam. Cam takes a big interest in Luce and Luce does feel attracted to Cam. Cam was a complex character who had both good and bad sides and that was enjoyable! I liked that the author made him little naughty, little good - not entirely bad. Generally: Fallen was fascinating, scary, fresh YA book with a wonderful story to tell and captivating characters! I am really glad that I picked the book up for reading and I cannot wait reading the next books in the series! Absolutely loved it!",Inga Kupp-Silberg
9780552561730,"SPOILERS ALERT! 3.5 Stars Luce ends up in Swords & Cross boarding school after an arson incident involving her boyfriend at her old school; one which was caused by the shadowy figures that keep following her. On her first day, she meets Arriane, finds herself inexplicable drawn to a guy, Daniel who for some reason hates her, manages to get humiliated in front of the entire school and hopefully finds a trusted friend in Penn. As the days pass by, a boy, Cam seems to make her feel most comfortable at this place and another, Daniel continues to shun her with occasional tenderness and she can't drop feeling a certain connection to him. Luce begins to somewhat fight back the shadows and makes it her mission to find information about Daniel with the help of Penn. She and Todd a fellow student are saved from a fire by some invisible force but Todd is killed by the shadows. In one of those rare moments with Daniel, Luce is compelled to tell him about the shadows she sees and gets an unexpected reaction from him; he seemed in despair. Cam cozying up with Luce ticks Daniel, leading to a fight; over her. That scene makes Luce realize that that she has to get things straight out with Cam as it is Daniel she feels for. Both of them finally give in to their building emotions in an intense kiss leaving Daniel baffled later that Luce survived. Daniel is forced to tell Luce the truth that leaves her shaken to the core; everything he said seemed as much familiar as it sounded crazy. All turns chaotic just as Luce begins to grasp what Daniel truly was and the depth of their relationship. With the end of an eventful night, Luce is forced to hide away, the fact still remains that she still knows little of the world she has been trust into. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ Alright, I'm having a sort of love/hate relationship with this book. The good news is that I love it more. First off, the first chapter about the past was a bad idea; it revealed much of the focal point of this book. I felt that the readers should have been kept guessing, trying to figure out the reason to Daniels behavior and their secret past. The writer lost the suspense element there. Apart from that, the first half of the book was quite dragging with little progress and it lacked world building and relationship building; I would have loved to see more tension and love building between Daniel and Luce instead of just recognition and the repetition of it. Another down point is that there was little character development on Daniel and Cam came out a more interesting and compelling character that it felt like a love triangle with Cam having the advantage. In the second half, the story started to really progress and got interesting. The bright side of it is Ms. Kate's solid writing with the right amount of showing with less explaining which am sure would have frustrated some but I love the mystery and the author must have done that to fruit later installments. Moreover, Luce's character was realistic and believable and the secondary characters were carefully penned and were fun and interesting especially Cam who was the most fascinating character so far. Lastly, I liked the cliff hanger sort of climax leaving more mystery to be uncovered.",Shayla

The writing is completely bland and unimaginative and I felt that whenever the author didn't know what to write she just re- wrote stuff she had previously done in the story.

9780142419403,"Review originally posted on my blog; http://cosyingupwithbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/book-review-anna-and-french-kiss-by.html 'Long awaited' is right! My goodness I've never been kept waiting that long for an inevitable kiss to happen! But you know what? It was well worth the wait. I loved pretty much everything about this book. The cover was what got me interested in the first place, the one on the right was the one I saw on Goodreads and thank god I clicked on it. I put it on my 'to-read' list immediately after reading the synopsis but pushed it back. Then, when my Amazon order messed up and I didn't get the books I was waiting for I took to iBooks to look for something to read in the mean time. Imagine my surprise when I saw Anna and the French Kiss was available for FREE download! So, I thought to myself 'ah what the hell' and downloaded it. This is the one and ONLY time I will thank Amazon for screwing up because what I read in the next couple of days was an emotion packed adventure. First of all, the characters; it was so so easy for me to relate to Anna and her internal monologues, her mannerisms and I eventually found myself feeling what she felt. I mean I was genuinely angry, sad, happy and excited when she was. Oh and I was also hopelessly in love with St. Clair by the end, I was sad when the story ended but happy for Anna all at the same time. My poor heart. For an author to be able to create such a strong connection between the reader and the protagonist is a skill some should learn to use but Stephanie Perkins need not worry. You met my expectations and then proceeded to give me more and for that I applaud you! There was a good mix of humor and drama for this genre of writing. I like romcom books simply because, whilst there are a lot of drama/thriller/mystery orientated books, romcoms have a way of removing you from your own reality and into a character's world. I was giggling all the way through this book and smiling to myself like an idiot. ""Josh rubs his belly like a skinny Buddha."" ""Oh god. What. Is with. The scary enthusiasm?"" ""Cheeseburger is always wearing this expression of surprise, like someone's just called his name and he can't figure out where the voice is coming from."" ""It's Victor's ghost, wanting to know why you wont touch him. Woooooooo, stroke me, St. Clair."" That last bit of speech made me laugh uncontrollably! Of course all of the quotes there are better if you know the context of them and I urge you to go and read the book to understand the delightful humor this story offers. I found it incredibly easy to see a bit of myself in Anna. For example; ""...she's smiling now. It's a good look for her. She should utilize the corners of her mouth more often."" and """"It's okay. It's not my business. My friends fight, too. I mean... my friends back home. Not that you guys aren't my friends. I'm just saying... all friends fight."" Argh how distressing."" Like Anna, I too have foot-in-mouth syndrome and can barely control it especially in awkward and uncomfortable situations. Anna's inner dialogue just seems a lot like my own and whether that's a personal thing or not, I still enjoyed the connection and the familiarity. At first, I didn't like the fact that Anna constantly moaned about being sent to Paris for school. I just kept thinking, ""Girl, you are in PARIS! Lighten up, you are in the city of romance and home to the most beautiful buildings in the world!"" But then, as the plot went on, Anna's character showed more and more signs of development. Towards the end of the book I understood that in order for any character development to happen, the author had to make Anna seem a little bratty and unappreciative so that in the end, she realized how lucky she was and everything her dad did was for her own good. If her dad hadn't of sent her to boarding school in Paris she'd still be waiting for Toph and numerous other things she didn't resolve until she moved away. She'd never have met St. Clair and that would be an awfully big missed opportunity. So, I definitely recommend this book to anyone who is 12+ due to a small number of bad words that are thrown around in the second half of the book. (****, fu**ing) But other than that it's a very enjoyable read and something that can be read as a distraction from everything else. Immerse yourself in the world of Anna Oliphant (Banana Elephant *wink wink*) and learn a few French words as you go along!",Amber Smith
9780142419403,"Review also available on my blog: http://readingismycupoftea.tumblr.com/post/92177584276/review-anna-and-the-french-kiss-anna-and-the-french Hi guys! Okay, let me say it outright, I LOVED this book. New favourite. Prime place on my shelf. Yearning for #2. Recommending to everyone I see. I LOOOOVVVEEEDDD this book. Seriously. Now you know what this review will consist of (me fangirling), let's begin! So, I knew right away I liked this book. You know when you start a book and the style/voice/narrator/tone just draws you in? That's how I felt when I started. It surprised me because even though I'd heard such glowing reviews and seen its high Goodreads rating, I was expecting between 65-90% cheeseballs. I mean, a teenage girl falling in love in Paris? I thought it'd be a quick, fun but predictable read. How WRONG I was! It grabbed me straight away. Perkins' tone is so damn easy to read and wonderfully addictive. You'll start by saying ""Oh I'll just read the first chapter out in the evening sun"" and end up chilly and locked out at 8:30pm because your Mum thought you were in your room. (....) *ahem* It's so gripping. The tone made you read so quickly that you visualise the scenes in your mind and forget that you're reading. The Paris element. I really loved the descriptions of the city and the people. I've been to France and Paris several times and I don't know if Stephanie Perkins has been there but she captures the essence of the city so well. A novel set in a boarding school in a foreign country could fall into the trap of focusing on the school and when the characters go outside then give vague descriptions - only using the place as a plot device. Perkins avoids that mistake and I loved how well she captures Paris. The characters. Oh sweet Lord the CHARACTERS! I've mentioned before how paramount characters are me, personally, when reading and I simply fell in love with every single character in this book. Even Dave. (I loved how realistically slimy he was). Firstly, the protagonist Anna. As a first person narrator, it is really important that the readers like Anna. I loved her. I think the moment I fell in love with her is here: IMAGE AVAILABLE ON MY BLOG. LINK ABOVE. That is my reaction whenever I (rarely) interact with a hot boy. I just flail and blurt out anything on my mind. So yeah that was the moment I fell in love with Anna. She is witty and hilarious throughout the whole book. - Sidenote: first book in a LONG time to make me laugh out. And cringe so badly I had to read through my fingers. Etienne St. Clair. Wow. I love him. He's so confident and Anna talks about his hair a lot and who doesn't like boys with gorgeous hair? And he's a gentleman and sweet and ... I'm beginning to sound like Anna right? Right. Another fictional character to obsess over. But ANYWAY. St. Clair. Some of you might remember that I was worried I might visualise my French teacher as he is also called Etienne. Yeah that did NOT happen. What I love about Etienne is that he is flawed. He's insecure about his height and his fear of heights. He does make mistakes. He's also so real. He goes through some real emotional stuff through this book and it makes him, more real. A character you can easily fall in love with. Easily. All the characters in this book were so developed, not just the couple and they were in the background. All interacted and were given thoughts, feelings. I loved seeing Rashmi develop through this book. Like I said earlier, I was expecting it to be cheesy. Which is why I liked that it wasn't that Anna loved Etienne straight away. One of my favourite moments of the book is the moment she realises she's in love rather than a crush. The development in this book is so so SO fab. The pace is also brilliant. I didn't find the beginning too long or the ending too rushed. The plot played out nicely and events happened in lovely pattern rather than randomly. When I got to the end, I didn't feel unsatisfied - wanting more or thinking it was too much, I felt like everything that needed to happen did. I loved where it ended. Overall this book is wonderful. It's romantic, cute and really gives you the feeling of being in love. There are moments where you laugh out loud and moments where you cringe so much you have to read through your fingers. Totally relatable and hilarious. I won't stop recommending this book to anyone. A joy to read. 5 stars. What did you think of Anna and the French Kiss? :) -Molly",Molly Gibson-Mee
9780142419403,"This book is amazing! The story is simple enough, but beautifully and creatively written. It's straight to the point but not boring. Stephanie Perkins mixed simplicity with fab. One of the best YA contemporary I've read. Let me tell you what I think of Anna. I love this girl, even though sometimes her heart gets in the way of her head it's almost stupid. But I like her wit. Her sense of humor and imagination are amazing. I love being in her head and it's a good thing that the book is written in her POV. She's funny and smart and sarcastic, in a good way. And considering that her father enrolled her in Paris against her will, I'd say Anna is also pretty strong. She handled her transfer well, even though it was difficult for her. One thing I don't like about Anna is that when she's hurt, she tends to push people away. She forgets her friends and chooses to go through her problems alone. In the process, she hurts the people who care for her, albeit unintentionally. So it's good that she has a friend like Rashmi to make her realize what she's doing. Now let's talk about Etienne. Smart, charming, beautiful Etienne. I love and hate him. I mean, he's a jerk. Leading on Anna like that. He has a girlfriend, goodness! He's so frustrating that a lot of times I want to strangle him. But I also can't deny the fact that Etienne is a hearthrob. More than his good looks, I like him because he has flaws. He's insecure with his height, he's afraid of heights and his teeth aren't perfect. It makes him more real to me. And despite of those imperfections, he's confident and funny and smart and kind. Funny and smart make a good combination, if you ask me. I love their friendship, their casual banterings, the fact that they're comfortable with each other. I liked the fact that even though they're miles away from their own families, they found home in each other. I was frustrated when things got complicated and they can't be together. That's when I started hating Etienne and thought of him as a jerk. But when I came to understand his reasons, I sympathized with him. And Anna. They are both afraid of being alone, especially Etienne. And because of that, he was hesitant to do something about his situation with Ellie, even though he's clearly unhappy with her. The other characters are also great. Meredith, Rashmi and Josh were awesome in welcoming Anna into their group when she was new in Paris. I love Bridgette's big words. (I learned a new word from her: CALLIPYGIAN.) And although Matt's character has minimum exposure, I liked that he's a real friend to Anna and wasn't hesitant to point out her mistake. The setting is also perfect. The city of Paris gave a romantic backdrop to the story. (Of course, it's the most romantic city in the world!) I even felt like I was touring in Paris every time Anna and Etienne go out. I love this book! The swoon-factor is so high, especially towards the end. It's a light read and enjoyable. Anna and the French Kiss also taught me that we don't have to face our problems alone. There's a reason we have friends and it wouldn't hurt to talk to them about what we're going through. Actually, it would hurt less.",Julie Rimpula
9780142419403,"OMG!!!!...I freaking in love with this book...i dont really care if this book is written in a perspective of a girl but I totally can connect with Anna in terms of emotion, the problems that she faced etc...This book really makes me want to go to France and visit all the places that Stephanie Perkins mentioned in this book...soooo damnnn goooooddddd!!!!!!...i should've read this book a long time ago but i feel really good now that i have read it and finally liking it...this book totally deserved 5 stars from me :)",Azizul Hanafi Bin Ahmadi
9780142419403,"One simple word to describe the book: AWESOME! I've been hearing about this book a lot on the net and wasn't disappointed after I've read it for myself. Follow Anna as she was thrown into School of America in Paris alone. Naturally, she's totally upset. But she met her neighbor Meredith and her gang of friends (Etienne included). So everything is normal in school except for her crazy attraction towards Etienne which grows while she was still thinking of her would-be-boyfriend Toph, plus the fact that Etienne has Ellie. (Booo...) Etienne is just too sweet... bringing Anna to places just because he knew she wouldn't leave the school/residence if no one asked her. So they had great fun. I seriously want to bash Etienne for behaving the way he did a few times in the book. Is he clueless? So ok, he may not be the most perfect guy who has a girlfriend and yet kept hanging around Anna (you the the reason why he did that-hanging around Anna I mean) but why did it had to take so LONG for him to figure out. But boy, when it did, it made my heart flutter! *dreamy sigh* Anna, keep him well!! Lots of things happened in the book. You'll love their little venture outside of school and everything else.

You can't help but love the characters and the hope that Anna and St. Claire get together, just pushes you through the book with ease. This book is more about the characters and not so much about Paris, so if your after a low down on the most romantic city in the world probably best to stick to lonely planet. It does however create a lovely atmosphere in which to picture the ups and downs of falling in and out of love. Overall a great book to get lost in.",Jen Munro

9780142412145,"I'm a sucker for romance any time of the year, but something about the holiday season makes me want to curl up in a nice blanket, drink hot chocolate, and read love stories. LET IT SNOW is the perfect holiday read. Maureen Johnson starts things off with THE JUBILEE EXPRESS, in which Jubliee (no, not a stripper, but named for a piece in her mother's collection of the Flobie Santa Village) finds herself stranded on a train in Gracetown in a huge snowstorm. A trip to the Waffle House introduces her to Stuart and friendship, or maybe something more, starts to form. In A CHEERTASTIC CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, author John Green hilariously describes the mission of three friends to get to the Waffle House where a group of cheerleaders are stranded and wanting to play Twister. And Lauren Myracle's THE PATRON SAINT OF PIGS shows that lost love can be found again with the help of Starbucks, angels, and even a pig. Each story stands well on its own, but it was nice to have a common thread throughout. I loved how the authors found ways to connect all three stories. Characters you meet in the beginning show up later on, and places like Starbucks and the Waffle House are important to all three tales. The only thing I didn't like was that they were all short stories - I could have kept reading about each of the characters! LET IT SNOW is a great, warm, fuzzy read for the holidays, so grab some hot chocolate and curl up because you won't want to stop reading until you're finished and happily sighing.",TeensReadToo
9780061767593,"This novel by reality TV starlet Lauren Conrad chronicles the lives of Jane Roberts and her best friend, Scarlett Harp, as they move to LA and become the stars of a reality TV show. The book, which is based loosely on Conrad's own life, is a little slow in the beginning, but picks up a bit once Jane and Scarlett are discovered at a club by a TV producer. From that point on the two, though a little hesitant at first, decide to audition for the show and their lives change drastically. While Jane takes to the cameras being around easily, Scarlett is not so excited and wonders what she got herself into. Throw into the mix two other cast members, Gaby, a total ditz, and Madison, a total witch with a nice girl facade, and things get even more complicated. When Jane starts dating Jesse, who happens to be the best friend of her friend-slash-major crush, Braden, things spiral out of control quickly and the jealousy of someone Jane thought she could trust ruins her life in an instant. With lots of run-of-the-mill Hollywood cliches (blondes, drugs, cosmetic surgery, etc), L.A. CANDY almost fails to deliver an original storyline. In addition, in pretty much every single chapter, Jane and her friends are drinking (usually vodka soda for Jane) making it seem to the unknowing person who has never been to LA that you can't have any fun in Tinseltown without being drunk. It is a quick and light read that would be great for the beach or a day when you don't need any actual depth in what you're reading. However, the ending is a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting to know what happens to Jane next.",TeensReadToo
9781599906959,"Wow... Just Wow. I dived into reading this book blindly. I have heard/seen this one around the book community and heard it was about a girl who was an assassin. That was pretty much the extent I knew of it. And I really just never thought to look more into it. One day I saw it, bought it and when it arrived, was like 'I'll browse through it tonight'...then BAM! I pretty much read this book in about two days. This book does very into multiple points of views but is written well that it flows together. Even though I can be a bit fussy when it comes to reading multiple people's views I still loved this book. I was hooked to the story from the beginning and was still intrigued to find out what was going to happen on the next page half way through. It has fantasy, magic, action, adventure and even a slight love triangle forming. And although there was a love triangle forming it thankfully wasn't what this book solely evolved around. At times some events, past stories and plot twists popped up unexpectedly. And usually I'd pick at those types of things, but it kind of played out well in the end that I didn't mind how they came about. I love the dialog and wittiness that was contained in this book. And, at multiple times, I even found myself giggling and hollering out load (to my own embarrassment). Overall I just loved it. This book really did surprise me, and in a way I'm glad I plunged into it without much knowledge of the story. I think it deserves the five stars of Goodreads. Now, onto the second book! :D",Elzar Valdivia
9781599906959,"One of my most highly anticipated reads of the year and it didn't disappoint! The story focuses a lot on the characters, which is something I adore. Celaena is a multifaceted gem of a character. She has her ups and downs, her moments of foolishness and stupidity mixed in with those of great intelligence. I felt sorry for her one moment and intrigued in the next. Even the secondary characters felt richer and deeper than they are often written. I can see why Maas has an online following of faithful readers. The one part of the story that I felt was lacking was in relation to the title of the book, The Throne of Glass. While there is mention of this castle and the glass walls and so on, it still felt as if there were no reason for it. Maybe it will come into play in a later book, but it wasn't significant enough in this one to merit the title. I'm not quite sure why it's even like this. It's not a metaphor, but literal glass. The storyline of the assassin's competition was wonderfully written and I loved hearing about the different aspects of the tests. There is a fantasy element to the storyline, one that isn't even mentioned in the description of the book. While it is featured throughout the story, it isn't something that should turn non-fantasy readers off. I found the element to be unique and it helped to move the story along appropriately - it wasn't just added in order to have some fantasy thrown in. Fans of historical fiction with strong women characters and some action are sure to enjoy this one. ARC reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.",Jessica
9781599906959,"Sarah J. Maas has written an intricate world with a layered plot and a strong and witty main character that I found myself rooting for. Since I don't read a lot of fantasy it took a bit to get accustomed to the names, places and such, but once I did, it became more enjoyable. Though I admit, I skimmed over some of the backstory about the land because that is not what interests me. I also had a bit of a hard time with the third person just because I am not used to reading that style, it's been awhile. But all in all I think that it works for this book because we do get glimpses into the lives of other characters besides Celaena and that provides neat insights into the story and the other characters. The characters are what kept my attention. The book begins with a master assassin Celaena being asked to participate in a contest of champions for the king, and I immediately liked her voice and thoughts. She is sarcastic, has something to say about everything, and toes the line but manages to have the good sense not to leap over it most of the time. I love her interactions with Chaol. In fact I pretty much enjoyed his character overall, the gruffness with the soft spot for her that he manages to hide most of the time. There's a love triangle going on because she also flirts with Dorian, the prince who chose her as his champion. I pulled for Chaol overall, but I don't really know where story is taking us. I loved the friendship between Chelaena and Nehemia. Nehemia is mysterious, powerful and from a country who the king is currently attacking, so that leaves intrigue always wondering what her motives are. But it also forms a bond between the two, that is very well written. I loved the challenges that Chelaena faces, and watching her train. It is quite an experience for me to read about a main character going through these things, because I am pretty weak myself, so it just makes me admire her. I do wish that some of the trials were detailed instead of just being told about them, but I suppose that would have been way too much, adding to an already long book. As it is, there is plenty of action and layers that keeps the story moving. Bottom line: action packed, page-turning fantasy with a kick butt heroine that I fell for.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781599906959,"Review By Alaiel Kreuz: Celaena Sardothien is the famous Adarlan's Assassin... but nobody knows who she really is and after being betrayed and imprisoned, she has spent the last year inside Endovier, a mine where cruelty was the reality of each day. Now she is sure no one would ever remember her. But the gods (or whoever was listening) gave her an opportunity to find freedom in the hands of Dorian, Crown Prince, son of the very man who sent her to Endovier, the cruel King of Adarlan... Of course, her freedom had a price: she would have to become the King's Champion and serve, as his personal assassin, during four years. The bottom line? There was a competition to choose the Champion. And someone wasn't going to play fair... Of course Celaena wasn't afraid of anything and took the chance. Now, under a false name, she is going to have to train again alongside Chaol, Captain of the Royal Guard, to become again the assassin she once was. The only problem was: could she really forget what the horrible King had done to every country he conquered? The screams, the suffering and pain she had witnessed in Endovier of all the slaves he kept? Through sticks and stones she would realize that someone was watching over her. That the magic the cruel King had tried to vanish was hidden waiting for the right time to come out and that she had an important part to play in Adarlan's destiny. Personal Opinion: I'm 100% sure that Throne of Glass has become, in less than a day, my favorite book of 2012... And I don't think there will be a book as good as this one until next year. At least for me. Have you ever found yourself gawking, gasping, closing a book only to remember how to breathe and then opening it again while wondering what could happen next? Or even afraid of reaching the end because you knew that, after reading the last line, you would be completely devastated knowing the wait - that excruciating wait- could kill you? Well, there's where I am right now. I can't believe I have to wait, who knows how long, for the next book to come out. I loved every second, every page, every quote of this book. Beginning with characters like Celaena, who besides being beautiful is also strong, fearless and deadly. Four ingredients that together create the perfect assassin for a world where war, suffering and death are a constant reminder of the tyrant ruling it: the king of Adarlan. But what made Celaena special was her human side. After being in Endorvien during a year - a place I fear completely- her soul is not broken but wounded. There are things she has seen, things that could make anybody break until nothing remain... except Celaena. Despite being scared at times she overcame those fears and controlled her live as best as she could. Two of her best qualities are her quick movements and witty retorts. And why do I like her so much? She likes being a girl, using pretty dresses, reading (OMG she reads so much!) and plays the pianoforte like nobody else. Then we have Dorian, the Crown Prince of Adarlan. Known as a womanizer he only wishes to find a way out of his world full of conspiracies and lies. He is clever, funny and sweet but at the same time a stranger during most of the book. To see him develop his personality was amazing and I honestly can't wait to read more about him. Chaol, the Captain of the Royal Guard, is the opposite: quiet, distant and very private. As Captain he doesn't trust Celaena during most of the book but, little by little, he starts to acknowledge her intelligence and respect her perseverance. I'm not lying if I say that right now I can't possibly choose between Dorian and Chaol... They both have won a place in my heart and I know that, whatever happens, I will cry for the one that stays alone. If that happens, of course. The book is also full of other characters that will make you smile like Princess Nehemia or Philippa. And you will cringe and shout with Cain, Kaltain or the King. As for the plot all I can say is that Sarah will rock your world. From the very first line you will see the book flow to your mind recreating every corner of this amazing story so you can share every adventure with the main characters. The sudden change of POV will help you understand all the conspiracies and feelings besides increasing your adrenaline. There is something different about this book, something that will charm you until the very end. Maybe its promise of magic, maybe it's the desire to know Celaena's complete history or the writing itself but I know you'll be thinking about the book several days after finishing it.",Alaiel Kreuz

I know, I know... prepare your torches and pitchforks to hunt me down. So, I was completely caught my surprised while reading this book. Which was a nice thing though because this book was simply amazing. The first word that popped into my head when I first finished this was: <b>adorable!</b> It is indeed such an adorable and cute story I couldn't put it down. There were some parts were I laughed out loud and almost rolled on the floor laughing, others I just kept smiling. I labelled this book as <i>one-of-those-you-can't-read-in-the-street-without-making-a-fool-of-yourself</i>. A nice label by the way since I do make quite a fool of myself in the street while reading a book. The characters were a pure delight. They were so funny and original I wished they were real and not characters written in a book. <u>Sophie</u>, turned into a 90 years-old lady, is always complaining and nosy. She really managed to bring the true nature of a ""grandmother"" despite her young years. Being the elder daughter, she thought her fortunes were always doomed until destiny proved her wrong. She is, indeed, one of the luckiest girls in Ingary without even knowing. She was mature enough to embrace her misfortune, being transformed by the Witch of the Waste, and keep moving forward in order to change it. But she caught up in the webs of Howl's adventures and Calcifer's treaty. She would worry about others despite of herself but she also had a selfish side. In fact she was so human I would love to meet her personally. <u>Howl</u>, the wizard everyone is afraid and scared because she captures young girls and eats them, is my favourite character! When we first meet him he seems quite shallow, vain, conceited and doesn't care about anyone but himself. He's character was a bit nerving and hard to appreciate at first, with all the tales told about him ringing in my mind. But as Sophie, and ourselves, come to know him better, he's not the monster everyone thinks. As the plot unfolds, he's turned into quite a lone guy who can't help being the way he is and whose destiny is crossed by a spell he has to avoid at all costs. And then, when we finally realise he's a great heart and falls in love with Sophie - best part in the book for me when he comes to rescue her - I can't help but adore him. <u>Calcifer</u>, the fire demon and the <i>person</i> in charge of moving the castle, was a character I had a difficult time to know what to think of him. At first he sort of scared me. I didn't know whether he was evil or not, what he's plan was and all. The word <i>demon</i> here, however, doesn't actually mean <i>evil</i>. Calcifer became a character needed in the story, his riddles and he's humour being a very appreciated. I loved him as I loved Howl. The storyline was very well developed since it hooks us in chapter one till the very end. It's hard to put it down for a minute 'cause you just want to read more and more and get to know what's going to happen. It was intriguing, funny and very smart. It had a bit of melodrama from Howl which I found extremely delightful. And there was also a chapter in which we are taken to the present day each added a bit of fantasy to the story and made me laugh so hard with the description of Sophie in the car. Howl's Moving Castle is an adorable (need to find another word for this), hilarious and delightful read for every age. I say it's a <b>must-read</b> for certain!",Leonor (Ner)
9780141350189,"First line: I WOKE TO DARKNESS I received a copy of Silver Shadows from Penguin Australia. This in no way has influenced my review. This review will contain spoilers from the Vampire Academy series and the previous Bloodlines BOOKS. It will NOT contain spoilers from Silver Shadows. I love Richelle Mead. I cannot explain how much. With each book she writes everything just seems to be getting better and better and I don??????C/??t even know how. SILVER Shadows is pure brilliance and, in my eyes, a masterpiece. I cannot control my fangirling at all. But what VA/Bloodlines fan can? There were so many moments in this book that I wanted to scream and dance. I read Silver Shadows in less than 12 hours. As soon as I received it and picked it up I could not put it down. From the first page the story grips you and you cannot put it down. Richelle Mead??????C/??s writing is breathtaking and gripping. Like The Fiery Heart, Silver Shadows is told from both Sydney and Adrian??????C/??s point of view. And let me tell you, Richelle Mead knows how to write from two perspectives. You can tell who is who even without having each chapter title. At the end of The Fiery Heart we are left with a massive cliff hanger and it doesn??????C/??t get better for either Sydney or Adrian. I wanted to hug them both and cry with them. Sydney, as we know, is in rehabilitation and it??????C/??s not great, not at all. She suffers in so many ways that I cannot explain. Sydney is so strong throughout the whole series and she becomes so much stronger in Silver Shadows and I admire her so much more. Adrian, oh my poor Adrian. I wanted to hit him across the head sometimes. I also wanted to hold him in my arms. I just wanted to make everything better. We really got to see a lot more of Adrian, the real Adrian. Richelle Mead captures the true emotions of her characters so much. And we feel those emotions too and it??????C/??s heartbreaking. He made some wonderful decisions and some, let??????C/??s just say a ??????C/??Really Adrian??????C/?? is needed. Why, why why. The romance. Oh how I feel for both Sydney and Adrian. Not even the universe wants them together. But those times, those times that I could not keep a smile off my face were brilliant. Adrian and Sydney are just so beautiful together. We get to know quite a few new characters in this BOOK. They were all very intriguing. Duncan is one of the new characters that I really enjoyed reading about. He was different, but still quite the same. Even though at times he annoyed me and got on my nerves because of things that he said and did. But I know that his intentions were in the right place. We also got to see a lot of our old characters as well. I loved seeing Rose and Dimitri. I always love seeing them and we even got to see that playful side of Rose that we haven't seen in a while. I also loved, like a lot, the scene with Dimitri and Adrian even though it might have not ended the best way, it was still nice to see. Lissa on the other hand. . . Lissa, I love you girl, but please just stop. I wanted to hit her across the face just so many times I cannot explain. Everything that came out of her mouth just got on my nerves like you wouldn??????C/??t believe. But I guess Lissa has always sort of been like this, but something just ticked me off. We finally get to see some faces that we only know names to and it??????C/??s really nice and thrilling at first, but then we see those people that we don??????C/??t want to see at all. They made my blood boil and yours will too. Okay, let me try and say something without giving anything away. Okay I can??????C/??t say anything that won??????C/??t give it away. But I know that you will know what I am talking about when you get to it and then we can all fangirl like crazy people. Because I was screaming around the house at 9 at night because of this and I just OMG. I love you Richelle Mead so bloody much. Trust me all of you will love it. Well I hope you do. Okay it is just so amazing and I cannot stop fangirling. None of you will not be able to do the same, not after you get to this bit. It??????C/??s just so cute and I cannot control myself. But, then again, I can hate you as well. Another cliff hanger. Why do you do this to us Richelle? Why hurt us, stitch up our hearts, then rip them out again? But you are the queen of cliff hangers that I can give you. There were so many times that I was on the edge of my seat. Turning one page after another, wanting to know what was going to happen next. Richelle Mead is unbelievable she grips you from the start and hold you on a leash. She doesn??????C/??t let go. You cannot anticipate what is going to happen next because she can pull something out of a hat that will turn it all upside town. Silver Shadows is utterly breathtaking, heart gripping and sensational. It??????C/??s Richelle Mead??????C/??s best work yet. It is a magical piece of work that pulls you right in, waiting for more.",Angelique

X-Ray is making things hard on Armpit with ticket-scalping/get-rich ideas that could eventually land them in trouble. There is, shall I say, a ""huge step"" between Holes and Small Steps.

9780545424929,"I've had my eyes on The Raven Boys for quite some time because of all of the positive reviews. I decided to wait a bit for a few reasons--maybe expectations would be on par instead of reading right when hype is high, and also, I just haven't had time in my reading schedule. I connected with Blue right away. I liked her voice and I could relate with feeling on the outside even if my feelings have nothing to do with the paranormal. Hers is because she hasn't been able to see ghosts or have any intuition for the supernatural world, she only amplifies that of her family. Speaking of they are so eclectic and fun to read about. It had to be hard for Blue as well because a premonition has followed her for her whole life-- that the boy she kissed/fell in love with would die. I mean talk about a dating downer and how you view yourself. When it came to the Raven Boys, it took me longer to get a sense of their separate personalities and how they played into the story. Gansey is the boy that Blue saw, so it seems that I would gravitate to him, but he seems to have a split personality and I had a hard time with his ups and downs and acting so differently. I was more drawn to Adam personally. I was pretty confused at times, and I know that some is probably on purpose, and honestly I would skim a bit, since I was intimidated by the size to start with. It had that feeling that everything was slowly setting up, and honestly I am surprised that I stuck with it since I had issues that I didn't really get inside the head of and feel for the guys as separate characters but also how they work together. But I liked Blue and I liked the mystical feel to it, and wanted to know how it would play out for Blue and Gansey. But there was something about it, even with my gripes that I just couldn't put it down and I had to know what would happen. As the story went on I was able to finally get a grasp on some of the raven boys, but Adam continued to be my favorite. There were so many twists, and changed what I thought of the different characters and the roles they played. Some of the character's actions really surprised me as well as the whole thread of her first kiss and who I thought and who I wanted it to be. I will be continuing the series, and glad I gave it a chance. Bottom Line: Slow set-up but loved Blue, one of the main characters, and the mystical tone",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780545424929,"There are some books I manage to put off for a while, despite their popularity and good reviews. The Raven Boys is one of those, and now having finally read it I can't help but kick myself for waiting so long. Paranormal fantasy books aren't my favourite, but the first book in Maggie Stiefvater's current series easily drew me in and hooked me with its quirky yet amusing characters, mysterious plot, and Maggie's beautiful style of writing. Reasons to Read: 1. An incredible group of characters: The characters are all very eccentric and quirky (and they really don't seem THAT realistic, or perhaps I should say ""typical"" for teenagers) and I find that can be fairly hit or miss for a book. I don't mind different, but I need interesting, strong characters whom I like to keep me going. The Raven Boys absolutely delivered on this, and I was so impressed with Blue and the Raven Boys she meets and befriends. Gansey's written as a charismatic leader and that's exactly how he comes across while reading. I couldn't help but like him, the more that was revealed about him. Adam's bravery comes across loud and clear as he battles his way through difficulties. Even grumpy, icy Ronan and quiet, strange Noah had me invested in their stories by the end. Most importantly, they felt like characters distinct from each other - although they're close friends, they maintained their own lives and interests. 2. An intriguing mystery: For the longest time, I was reading as fast as I could just to figure out exactly what the big mystery was - what was Gansey searching for? What was going on with Blue's family? What secrets do the Raven Boys have? It's all revealed very slowly, and I loved how much this mystery drew me in to this fantastic story. 3. Gorgeous writing: This is the first book I've read by Maggie Stiefvater and her writing took my breath away! The book's atmosphere is creepy and mysterious, and it's enhanced by her style of writing. It's like being teased with a little bit of information - there are little hints and it's very poetic. Her writing flows beautifully for an enjoyable read. 4. Heartfelt, sincere relationships: This was my favourite aspect of The Raven Boys. I loved how strong these relationships were, from the deep bond of friendship between Gansey, Ronan, Noah, and Adam to the fairly tight-knit household Blue lives in. I was particularly impressed with the mother-daughter relationship between Blue and Maura. This is an intensely loyal group of characters, all displaying that loyalty in their own unique way. I was worried that I'd find some parts of this book to feel like it was trying too hard - afraid that it might come off cheesy and silly, because there's that fine line between unique and just plain silly. But thankfully, The Raven Boys didn't cross that line. It was a very unexpected read for me (especially the romance, for example!), and one I can wholeheartedly recommend to other readers.

9780545424929,"(Source: I won a hardback copy of this book. Thanks to Sandra at Waiting for Wentworth.) 16-year-old Blue's future love life does not look good, mainly because every psychic that has ever come across her has told her that if she kisses her true love, she will kill him. Standing at a church on St Mark's Day with her aunt, waiting for the spirits of the soon-to-be-dead to walk past, she sees a spirit - which is unusual for Blue, as she is not psychic. The spirit tells her that his name is Gansey, and then disappears. When Blue later meets Gansey, she discovers that he is a high school student investigating ley-lines, and is trying to re-open them around the area where Blue lives. Blue decides to help him and become part of his team, but she's not prepared for what they are about to discover. What is the secret of the ley-lines? How do they open these magical pathways? And what is Gansey's end goal? This was a very strange story, and the pacing seemed very slow. Having read this I'm wondering if I've missed some intricacies to the plot or something, or maybe we'll get more explanation in the next book, because for a 409 page book, not a lot really happened. Blue seemed like a fairly normal girl, other than her name and the fact that she lived with a bunch of psychics. Blue wasn't a psychic herself, but instead had a gift that allowed her to magnify power somehow, making her a very useful tool for both her psychic relations, and spirits. Blue was pretty down to earth all things considered, and didn't immediately fall all over herself to help Gansey and his crew. She didn't whine, she wasn't always seeking attention, and she didn't think that everything was about her either. She generally just tried to help, and knew her own limits which was nice to see. Gansey on the other hand was absolutely obsessed with these 'ley-lines' and seeming would let very little get in his way of opening them, and allowing them to lead him to this legendary king that he was so sure he was supposed to find and awaken. The storyline in this book was quite odd. I'm not sure I've ever read anything like this. I have to say that I found the whole thing very strange, especially in the beginning, and I'm really not sure what else to expect from this series. Basically, Gansey is trying to open these magical ley-lines, to find this legendary king, and awaken him. Fair enough, but I'm not sure how this is going to take so many books. Having read over 400 pages of this one, I can't really say that that much has happened. The pacing just feels really slow, and I really expected us to have discovered more than we have in this first book. It's been a while since I read a book by this author so I can't remember if her other books were this slow (I think they might have been), but the pacing in this just made me feel that nothing was happening which was really frustrating. Otherwise the plot was okay, but I thought more could have been made of Blue's prophecy that she would kill her true love with a kiss. We did find out very early on that Gansey might be Blue's true love, but very little happens with regard to this, and so we are very much left hanging on this front. I thought the ending to this book was okay, but again, I feel like so little happened in this book, that it was more like reading part 1 of a book rather than book 1 of a series. Having finished this I'd say that it's okay, but I'd be pushed to say more than that. I have very lukewarm feelings towards the sequel, because although I want to know what happens, it seems like a lot of effort for little reward. Overall; an okay YA fantasy, with a very slow pace. 6.75 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth

And how, when people take their own lives, it affects a whole community. Some people say that it's 'gross' or 'inappropriate'. We read this book in school for a study, because our fabulous teacher thought it would be a good piece to read, not just because of how it's written, but because of the insights. Sure, there are a few sexual references, but to be honest, half of the shows on TV are worse. And those sort of things *do* happen to teenagers. And much worse. If you can't deal with that, then just don't read these kinds of books. It's simple. Truth be told, it really got me thinking. And I would recommend it to any teenager.

9781595143273,"Review can be found on www.paperiot.com I thought Thirteen Reasons Why was based on an original and contemporary concept. It's good to realize that the littlest thing can cause a ripple effect that changes your entire life. And not just your own, but others' too. Suicide is a tough issue to discuss, but it's also something that's important to think about. Jay Asher discusses suicide via Hannah Baker, a girl who committed suicide and has send out tapes to her 'thirteen reasons why', the people that caused her to end her own life. The book is written in an unusual way, which I loved. There are no real chapters. Instead, the book consists of thirteen cassette tapes, alternating between Clay listening to and thinking about Hannah's story (I loved the 'play' and 'pause' buttons!). There's a simultaneous narration: we hear Hannah's thoughts through the tapes she recorded, and we see how Clay reacts to that. However, I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish their voices. I tend to read quickly, and the sentences (some in bold, some in italic) kept blurring together to this one story. I had to keep rereading passages to know who said what, which was a bit annoying after a while. I think this book is probably enjoyed best in an audiobook format. I loved the concept of the book more than the execution of it. I expected this story to make me sad and touch me deeply, because of the heaviness of the subjects (a life ending too soon, missing the opportunities to help someone, guilt, grief, loss). Unfortunately, that was not the case. I didn't think the characters lived up to the expectations I had of them. While Clay was a sweet guy, as a character he was rather flat. He was almost too nice to be true, where I like characters better when they're flawed. I can't compare myself with someone who's perfect. Every other character, except Hannah, felt a bit forced to me. But despite the fact that I wasn't really emotionally invested, I just HAD to know what drove Hannah over the edge. It was what kept me going the entire time. I've read a lot of reviews where people thought her reasons to commit suicide were shallow, but I don't agree. They were her reasons after all. And who are you, as a reader, as an outsider, to say that they're not enough. The reason of the book was not to judge Hannah, but to make you think of the effect of everything you do, as small or as big as the consequences may be. For Hannah, as she suffered from depression, they were a mix. But every small thing added up to one another, which caused her to fall apart. Hannah's character was very well written. Where I was rather annoyed with her at the beginning of the story (I thought she was selfish and bitchy - talk about being judgmental!), I've grown to understand her and feel truly sorry for her. And I'm glad that Asher didn't portray Hannah as a victim. She had her flaws, made wrong decisions, and just decided to give up on herself. Though I'm not sure it's fair how Hannah makes everyone else a victim. Do they deserve to live with the guilt of being responsible for Hannah's death? I also felt that by giving Hannah thirteen reasons, Asher stretched it out a bit too much. I found it difficult to understand why Hannah went to such lengths to record her tapes. There were certainly terrible things that were done to her, yes, and they added up from the very first story. But some of the reasons (and especially the last one) felt forced, like it was the goal and not the product of Hannah's despair to have thirteen reasons. Another thing that I felt was forced was the map. Yes, it's a nice way to let Clay wander around the town with some sort of purpose, but I don't think it added up to the story. All in all, it's a good book. It carries a strong message that our behaviors, no matter how small or big, have an effect on the feelings of others. As Hannah tells us: ""I guess that's the point of it all. No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people. Often we have no clue.""",Judith

But the story of two girls who know each other by spending the summer at the same cottages each and every summer since they were little is full of conflicts that go nowhere. I don't mind this kind of plot most of the time but I also didn't find the mother's behaviour realistic at all. And in general I found the story to be entirely so blatantly feminist and left wing that it really was unpalatable to me.

9780312641894,"Cinder is an amazing retelling of the Cinderella fairytale (in case that wasn't obvious). I'm not even sure I can explain just how great this book is, I loved it from the first page to the very last. When a story has cyborgs, princes, androids, aliens, a deadly plague that's bound to wipe out the human race, it's bound to be spectacular. Linh Cinder is a strong female character, her problems and insecurities only leading to her becoming even stronger. It's the first time I agree through and through with all of the character's decisions and ways of handling matters. You can also easily connect not just with her, but with the side characters as well. For example, there's a little child who appears briefly in the book, but it's one that definitely leaves an impression. The villain is absolutely fascinating! Queen Levana is an extremely powerful enemy, one that you should never ever cross. The entire Lunar race is so enjoyable to read, from their abilities to their quite large family tree :) There were a lot of plot twists that you could easily predict, however this just makes you want to keep on reading to see how everything unravels. And it wouldn't be Cinderella without a ball, right? That was by far my favorite scene from Cinder, so much was going on that I just couldn't put the book down. *Favorite quotes ""Even in the Future the Story Begins with Once Upon a Time."" ""Prince Kai! Check my fan, I think I'm overheating."" *Rating Characters: 5/5 Main character, side characters, every single person mentioned is amazeballs!! - except Adri, of course - Romance: 4/5 While I absolutely loved it, I wanted much much more (which I'm hoping we'll get in the sequel). Pacing/Length: 4.5/5 Don't get me wrong, the beginning of the book was interesting too, but in the end you were just getting your face slapped with constant action and plot twists and did I say action?! I'm well aware a book can't be all about that - and that's why the beginning was a tiny bit slower - , but the change was so quick that you can tell from where it started to get really good. Cover: 5/5 In love with it. Always have been, always will be. Plot: 5/5 DAMN this story is good.",Ioana Culcea
9780312641894,"Marissa Meyer has completely blown me away with her debut book, Cinder. Full of the familiar details we associate with Cinderella - a handsome prince, a wicked stepmother and a seemingly unattainable ball - but told in such a new and different way that the story becomes fresh and exciting! Linh Cinder is a cyborg - a human who has been surgically repaired with mechanical parts - and this makes her both a second-class citizen and the property of her legal guardian and stepmother - Adri. Working as a mechanic in New Beijing alongside her android companion Iko, Cinder dreams of a life of freedom for her, Iko and Peony - the stepsister she loves. Her thoughts of escape quickly crumble as Peony catches the fatal plague Letumosis and Adri has Cinder's body ""volunteered"" for plague research, blaming Cinder for Peony having been infected. Cinder is a wonderful protagonist. She's sarcastic and full of witty one-liners: ""If you excuse me, I'd better go try to earn my keep so you might actually blink an eye the next time you find a convenient way to get rid of me."" She knows the treatment of cyborgs is unfair, but she doesn't complain about it. She feels such passion that I can't understand how anyone could question whether she was human, especially when it comes to the people she loves. She's selfless - sacrificing her dignity and her pride to do what she knows is right, and she never takes the easy way out. She grows to care for Prince Kai, which fuels her guilt over withholding that she is a cyborg. I loved watching Cinder's journey, and the many discoveries she makes about herself and her past along the way. I truly felt my heart ache for her with every accusation thrown at her by Adri - whether it was being blamed for her stepfather's death or being told her emotions weren't valid (because she's incapable of feeling). I admired her strength with coming to terms with her past and what that will mean for her future, and her resilience in the face of multiple obstacles. I loved watching her relationship with Prince Kai develop from mere astonishment at being in his presence, to the banter and teasing of a blooming crush. Watching Kai try harder with each of Cinder's objections was entertaining, and his complete bafflement over her rejection to his request(s) that she accompany him to the ball was endearing. Trusting Cinder with the information she uncovered in his android was a risky move, but it was nice to see him open up honestly, without the censorship that comes with being diplomatic. I really enjoyed that Cinder didn't spend a lot of her free time thinking about Kai's physical appearance, and that when she did spare a minute for him, it was with concern for his well-being. It was refreshing to see a romance that had chemistry and spark, but that wasn't all-consuming for either person involved. I also loved the supporting characters. Iko is sassy and charming and hilarious! I laughed out loud when she wheeled in, dressed up in Adri's pearls and lipstick, pretending she was at the ball. My heart seized up in my chest when Adri told Cinder she had left some spare parts on her bed that couldn't be sold and thus were useless, and I cried real tears for Cinder who couldn't. Queen Levana (and the lunars in general) was so creepy, never knowing what was hiding under her projected illusion of beauty. Her ability to manipulate a large, enraged and protesting crowd into believing she was worthy of being their empress was both impressive and frightening and knowing that everything she does has an alterior motive kept me in suspense of her next move. Dr. Erland is mysterious and slightly crazy, but you can't help but feel drawn to him. He has this quality about him that is simultaneously both exasperating and captivating, making you soak up every word he says - it's like he holds the secrets of the universe, but wants to leak them to you slowly instead of just blurting out what he knows. So frustratingly good! The world-building was fantastic, and actually incorporated the entire world! After WWIV, the remaining Eartherners came together to form a united front, joining together in an alliance of peace. All that remains is getting Queen Levana of the Lunar planet to commit to the alliance - something the leaders of each area are trying to accomplish together. It was easy to picture New Beijing, a bustling city filled with new technology and old traditions, and the idea that a nuclear war lead to the destruction of life as we currently know it is completely feasible. The plague that has affected both Cinder and Kai personally is a world-wide pandemic, leaving no region untouched. Everything was just different enough that it didn't take a lot of suspension of belief to achieve the type of world Cinder lives in, which really helped me capture Meyer's vision. I loved everything about Cinder. I did see the twist ending coming, but even that wasn't enough to curb my excitement over hearing it revealed or the lingering suspense left with the open ending! Brilliant characters, a fast-moving plot and a completely fresh spin on a classic tale has left me eager for more!",Pretty Little Reader
9780312641894,"I've wanted to read this book for months! The cover rocks. I finally got the chance, and it was amazing. I loved this book!! 5 Stars! Warning: I almost gave it 4 stars because I was so mad that the ending left me hanging so badly, but once I calmed down I realized I loved the read so much it deserved 5 stars. I'm dying to read the next book! I haven't been this into a series in awhile. I don't read sci-fi so I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't expecting it to be a new favorite that's for sure. I loved the world of New Beijing. It was intense and heart breaking. The plague was terrifying and hopeless. Cinder was a cyborg which meant she was human but had machine parts added by scientists after an accident of some kind. The human citizens looked down on the cyborgs. Some felt they should have died in whatever accident made them need cyborg parts. They felt it was unnatural and basically were scared of them. Cinder lived in fear that people would discover she was cyborg. Her ""family"" hated her for it. Cinder's best friend was her droid Iko, a robot. Iko was unique with her personality. I loved it! She had a crush on the Prince. My favorite quote by Iko was after meeting the Prince. ""Prince Kai! Check my fan, I think I'm overheating."" (pg. 14) Prince Kai was great! I think I'll stop here so I don't give away any of the amazing twists and turns throughout the book. Cinder took me on an amazing ride. I laughed. I cried. I screamed. I sighed. It was wonderful.",Clean Teen Fiction
9780312641894,"4.5 stars. Cinder is retelling of the classic Cinderella story, but with a fantastic sci-fi twist. Since I love retellings, I've been looking forward to this one and it was even better than I expected! Kudos to Marissa Meyer for making our futuristic Cinderella a cyborg which may sound weird, but it totally works for this book. The novel is set in New Beijing, a city rebuilt after the fourth world war. The world building is awesome and when I read about the setting of New Beijing, I could not help but think of scenes from one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies, Blade Runner. While Cinder is not dark like Blade Runner, there are the hovercrafts, Asian influences and androids that remind me of Cinder. A big change from the original fairytale is instead of one villain, there are two. Adri is Cinder's stepmother but she is really the wife of the man who adopted Cinder. He died shortly after the adoption and Adri has hated Cinder ever since. Adri is bitter, petty and does her best to put Cinder down. While we hate Adri for bullying Cinder, the real threat is from Queen Levana, ruler of a race of people with paranormal abilities who inhabit the moon. Levana is evil, manipulative and cunning with plans to rule Earth, but she needs to marry Prince Kai to put her plans into motion. Cinder is a very likable character. She has a bad home situation that she desperately wants to escape from, but of course, her destiny is more entwined with Prince Kai and the Lunars than she can ever imagine. There is more to Cinder than meets the eye and it is easy to figure out very early in the novel. With Adri's verbal abuse and Cinder's insecurities over her cyborg enhancements, it's easy to empathize with her, especially when Prince Kai flirts with her and Cinder thinks she is not good enough for him. I don't feel that I got to know Prince Kai well enough in this book. A few portions of the novel were told from his perspective and we see that he is a nice guy who puts the safety and well being of his people before his own happiness. He is sarcastic, smart and completely swoon worthy. His friendship with Cinder is sweet and leaves room to grow and develop. I really hope we get a lot more of Kai in upcoming books because he has the potential to become one of my favorite book boys. Cinder does not end with a cliffhanger but leaves you wanting so much more! Cinder is an awesome debut novel and I hate that I have to wait until next year to read the sequel. This is one of my favorite retellings and I highly recommend it! Content: Kissing and some violence",Novia Chang
9780312641894,"I know I am late coming to the debut ball, but I am here now and I will join the masses who say that CINDER will rock you to the moon - and no, I am not saying this because the Lunar queen has brainwashed me. I envy Marissa Meyer for dreaming up such a wonderful Cinderella re-telling and creating a breathtaking world with a cast of characters that you will fall in love with. I love a heroine who does not mind getting her hands dirty and can talk shop, not to mention a prince who slums it among the commoners for a little slice of freedom. I am still curious to see how Cinder's cyborg-ness will factor into things; currently Marissa Meyer has used it to present some minor drawbacks which make Cinder all the more adorable when she interacts with Prince Kai. The story ends right before trouble can fully unfurl its nasty head, but CINDER leaves readers in a rock-solid happy place with a sense of satisfaction for how the fairy tale pans out. Of course, you will want MORE, but trust me when I say that CINDER will not leave you barely hanging on the cliff - you will hang for certain, you will ask for seconds, but you will feel safe in knowing that Book 2 will be SO worth the wait!",theEPICrat
9780312641894,"Judging by the comments I've read when I mentioned reading this one, it has LOTS of buzz! Since I try my darndest not to read other reviews before I'VE had a chance to read a review book, I can only go my own feeling on this one and say, ""Well deserved!"". I read this in one LONG sitting (which left me very tired the next day - I should learn not to start a new book for my nightly read). Linh Cinder is a 16-year-old mechanic at New Beijing's weekly market. Her guardian, Adri, relies on Cinder's income to pay her own bills and those of her own two daughters, Peony (14) and Pearl (17). Adri's husband Garan adopted the orphan Cinder when she was five and soon after contracted letumosis, a deadly ""plague"" for which there is no cure. Adri resents Cinder and, as in the old fairy tale, finds reasons NOT to allow her to go to the royal ball. Peony is Cinder's only human friend, but she also has a great sidekick named Iko, a witty android/ Kaito (Kai), the Crown Prince of the Eastern Commonwealth, the heartthrob of many a teenage girl, comes incognito to Cinder's market stall to ask her to fix his android Nainsi. Kai's mother died of the plague, and now his father, the Imperial Majesty Emperor Rikan, has contracted the disease. Cinder is not starstruck like most girls, and Kai takes a liking to her. Cinder knows it would never work, because she is a cyborg as a result of the hovercraft accident that killed her parents. Cyborgs are considered less than human, treated as property, and there is even a draft for cyborgs for testing for a plague antidote. Then comes a tale that mixes a bit of steampunk with a bit of dystopia and science fiction. A kick-butt heroine, a handsome prince, an abusive adoptive mother, a doctor determined to find a cure for the plague, villains in the form of ""Lunars"" who evolved from an Earthen moon colony centuries ago and now have the power to manipulate people's minds - all combine to create this wonderful roller coaster of a ride through a wonderfully-drawn, realistic world. I seriously wanted to SLAP Adri in so many places throughout this book. I figured out a central theme early on, but that didn't stop me from reading on. The villain, the Lunar Queen Levana, is spot-on creepy and manipulative. The romantic aspects are appropriately timed, which, sadly, doesn't happen in a lot of YA. Cinder is a girl that will make you root for her. You'll smile at Iko's sarcasm, gnash your teeth at Adri's actions, hope against hope that Cinder will be on time for ... (oops, can't tell you, THAT would be a spoiler for sure). In short, even if you're not a YA/sci-fi/steampunk reader, you'll still like this book, because it's a story about a girl who doesn't fit in, but has not let her spirit be broken. She has dreams and the will to make them happen, as well as the smarts to figure out how to do it. This is the first in a series by a debut author, and will likely be on my list of 2012 faves at the end of the year. Buy it, borrow it, definitely read it. QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy): And the prince did know her now, sort of. He had been kind to her at the market. Perhaps he would ask her to dance. Out of politeness. Out of chivalry when he saw her standing alone. The precarious fantasy crashed down around her as quickly as it had begun. It was impossible. Not worth thinking about. She was cyborg, and she would never to the ball. They said she'd murdered her older sister, Queen Channary, so that she could take the throne from her. They said she'd had her own husband killed too so that she would be free to make a more advantageous match. They said she had forced her stepdaughter to mutilate her own face because, at the sweet age of thirteen, she had become more beautiful than the jealous queen could stand. Cinder stared at the holograph and imagined watching herself die. In real time. ""How many different batches of antibodies have you gone through?"" ""Med?"" ""Twenty-seven,"" said the med-droid. ""But,"" said the foreign voice, ""they die a little slower each time.""

9780141331874,"And I thought I'd had enough of vampires. After many beloved and some stereotypical YA vampire books in the past years I felt fine with putting that category on the waiting list for a while. Until I decided to pick up the first book in this series and Richelle Mead's VAMPIRE ACADEMY restored my faith in good and imaginative vampire worlds. I'd had my eyes on the VAMPIRE ACADEMY books for quite a while, many people kept recommending them and I can remember the rave about the last book in the series. Now with the first movie coming out in 2014 I couldn't hold out on this series any longer. Richelle's series isn't your average -There's a vampire in this story and he's gonna bite you, so you become one, too- story. In the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series you don't encounter ordinary vampires. There are different types of blood-suckers, like different links to an evolutionary chain. Our two heroines Rose and Lissa cover the two categories of Moroi and Dhampirs. Moroi are vampires who have the power to wield magic. Dhampirs are a crossing between Moroi and humans and their task is to protect royal Moroi. At the St. Vladimir's Academy they are receiving a special training for the purpose of becoming body guards when they are finished. Those two kinds are co-existing and depending on the other, never purposefully harming humans. The Strigoi make up the third and an entirely different category. They are soulless creatures only existing to destory and hurt humans, Moroi and Dhampirs alike. Strigoi are effortless killers, but they can also be cruel enough to turn the other vampires into one of them and doom them to become evil and heartless, too. They make for evil and seemingly unstoppable enemies in all six books of this series. The fight between Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi is the main focus of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series. Of course you can expect political, social and personal conflicts as well. Now the St. Vladimir's Academy is home to many Moroi and Dhampirs and is the central setting for the six books in this series. Housing, training and study rooms assembled like a small campus, the academic feel is definitely there. But with all the unexpected attacks and complications appearing on the scene it's no wonder Rose and her friends are forced to leave their textbooks behind and step into battle. The characters are travelling a lot, too. Really enjoyed seeing many new places together with Rose and her friends. All six books read on a book binge equal a huge vamptastic adventure beyond imagination. So much action and fights! However the series has its quiet moments, too. The greatest personal focus lies on the bond Rose and Lissa share as best friends and their spiritual bond that's pretty special for Moroi standards. Rose can feel what Lissa's feeling and in certain moments even see through Lissa's eyes. At first this was a very fun aspect about their friendship. The more often Rose visited Lissa's body though, story lows occurred. Sometimes I just felt like skipping these scenes altogether. Rose is the breakaway, tough and sexy warrior. Lissa her well-guarded, spiritual, emphatic protege. They are body and mind, friends who rule the hearts of many readers. They are lucky to have been gifted with two equally appealling love stories, slightly erotic, romantic and steamy for sure. Lissa finds Christian, an outsider, who was not even looking for acceptance until he met Lissa. They are healing each other from the wounds of their pasts and click together like a puzzle meant to exist. And Rose gets her love story with Dimitri. Just like everyone told me, that guy is sexy! Their difference in age and experience puts a forbidden touch to their love story. He is her instructor and she is supposed to keep her hands off him. Is that a dare? Major turn-on! The first book in the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series is funnily the one book which I liked least out of the six books in this series. I don't remember it as overly significant to the story, not remarkable character development-wise. Its writing feels a bit clumsier than the other books. While I read all six books back to back, I definitely saw a noticeable evolution over the entire series in writing, story line, character development, and surprising moments. FROSTBITE, the second novel, is one of my favourie parts in the series, sending our friends on a trip to winter wonderland where they stay at a dreamy lodge. And this instalment offers the chance to make new friends and meet another boy who will play an important role in Rose's life, Adrian. SHADOW KISS is the part of Rose's story that concentrates on the St. Vlad's students' training the most. The academy announces a big training and fight simulation for the entire school, which is supposed to prepare them for their lives as body guards. In the beginning of each book Rose is often telling you what's happened so far. What is a thoughtful help for people who had to wait such a long time between the novels, is kind of repetitive for binge readers like me. Tiring were recaps in the beginning, retellings of major events in past books and hints as explanations to relationships strewn into the ongoing story. BLOOD PROMISE is a lot about travelling and enduring hardships. It's probably the darkest book in this series! SPIRIT BOUND is about returning to the place you belong, your true self and the fight for justice. The books keep getting longer and longer. Currently LAST SACRIFICE is the longest book I've read so far this year. Not just in page count - 2688 pages- is this series truly epic, but in its emotional variety, youthful voices, and imaginative, adventurous story line. 5/5 ***** VAMPIRE ACADEMY Series- One of the most enthralling and memorable YA vampire worlds I've had the pleasure to live in. A series I wish I would have encountered much sooner. I'm so glad that all six books were released already and I could pick up the next book right after one was finished. I wouldn't have wanted to wait one year for each of them to come out. The first three BLOODLINES books are waiting on my Kindle to be read. The decision whether to start the series now or wait till all of them have been released has yet to be made.",MissPageTurner

Ia??ve been hearing a lot of buzz about Rainbow Rowell recently and knew I needed to check out her books! And Ia??m glad I did, I really liked Eleanor & Park and give it a 4/5 stars! I think Rainbow Rowell has a distinctive writing style and I enjoyed it. It made this book unique and stand out from other contemporary novels. As for the plot of the book, it was mainly the romance but the family issues raised were just realistic and done very well. Sometimes I felt the pace of the story was a little too slow for my liking and that affected my rating a little. The other thing that stopped this book being a 5/5 was the ending. For me, it was too open ended and although I see why the author decided on this, it still annoyed me because I like to have everything wrapped up and answered! None of my questions were answered so I had to take a star off! The characters in this book are what make this book great. They are all so original and different! Park was my favourite, I just adored him. He was sweet, kind, gentle and loved comics! Then therea??s Eleanor who isna??t afraid to be who she is and I loved that about her!

9781250012579,"I find it that the hardest reviews to write are those for books that I loved most. It just feels that there are no words powerful enough to express how happy this novel made me. I formed a close connection to this book, and had I made a list of 2012 favorite reads, Eleanor and Park would be very high up on it. It felt personal, and it felt mine. The story takes place in 1986, a year before I was born. I am old enough to remember making mix tapes, running out of batteries in walkmans and begging for privacy talking on the land-line phone because, well, what other options were there? 90s nostalgia aside, I highly enjoyed this novel for numerous reasons. Both Eleanor and Park are very-well rounded and multi-layered characters that you can't help but fall in love with from the word go. Since the story is told from two perspectives, we gain enough insight into their lifestyles which define who they are-Eleanor coming from a broken and unstable home, Park defined by his ethnicity. When they clash, surprise, it's not insta-love. I loved watching them slowly bonding over music, comic books and common misfit issues, and this is where the personal connections comes in. Some of the conversations between the two of them sounded like echoes of conversations that Darling and I had. I many ways Eleanor reminded me of myself, especially in her shortcomings. Just like Park does to Eleanor, my boyfriend introduced me to the awesomeness that is Watchmen (among others). So when I say that the characters were relatable, and their conversations and voices realistic, I mean it from the bottom of my heart. The romance is not a typical love story, and there is no happy ending, just something that has to happen. My heart skipped a beat at the last page and reminded me what Eleanor and Park's story is all about-love against all odds, and finding yourself in spite of all obstacles. Eleanor and Park was, in short, charming, witty, entertaining, emotional, a guaranteed re-read and definite favorite.",Ivana

After reading Eleanor & Park earlier this year and loving it, I knew I had to continue reading Rainbow Rowell's works! I'm happy to say this book did not disappoint and I give it a 4/5 stars! Let's start with the characters, there's Cath, who I actually really liked! She was an introvert who loved writing fanfiction (I can relate to being an introvert and I like to read fanfiction!). She was smart, caring, funny and damn she could write! She had a few issues (don't we all?) but I was able to see past them and just enjoy her as a character. Then there's Levi (I confess, I actually thought he was gay at first) but I just grew to love him! He was so sweet, friendly, nice, easy going guy and even though he struggled with reading, he found other ways to help him get through college, his determination was admirable. Their relationship together was good, I think I wanted a bit more but what I got was fine by me!

Then there's Wren and Cath's dad who was just so odd, I actually can't find the words to describe him, he was interesting and I loved how much he cared about the girls! Reagan, Cath's roommate, was awesome! Her lines cracked me up! There were other minor characters who I really didn't care about like Nick and their Mum, I didn't feel they added anything to the story. As for the plot, I felt this book was so different to Eleanor & Park (Which in my opinion was much more serious and deep) but I liked a lot of the plot points. I loved the fanfiction element, how it was explained as borrowing characters not stealing them! However I didn't like the Simon Snow series, I know it was supposed to be similar to Harry Potter, but for me it was too similar and it was done very badly! I wasn't interested in the series at all therefore wasn't interested in Cath's fanfic about it. I will admit to skipping pages about Simon Snow and the fanfic because they just completely bored me. This was one of the reasons I couldn't give this book a 5/5! Other plot points such as the importance of family was done very well and it made me grateful for my family! The impact and the effect on the girls because of what happened in the family was very realistic. First love, friendships, college, mental illness, these are just a few other things this book touches upon and I think they all intertwined well in this book and made it entertaining! Overall this book was really good and I recommend it to everyone! I cannot wait to continue with Rainbow Rowell's novels!",brookexx
9781250030955,"Who is that fangirl everyone is talking about? She is inconspicuous, modest, dedicated and spends most of her days in front of her laptop writing new fan fiction. Cath and her twin sister Wren are about to start college, a more grown-up part of their lives. But Cath can't let go of the books that have kept her company for so many years. Fandom and fan fiction are the overall theme of FANGIRL. Rainbow's third book teaches us that fan fiction can be a very important part of a teenager's life. Through their writing teens get a chance to stay with their beloved characters, expand their imagination, express their creativity and get in contact with other fans. A fan can be found in every reader, too. How often have we read a book and couldn't stop talking and thinking about it? There are countless book worlds I would've loved to spent more time in. I don't read fan fiction nor have I ever written anything like it, but I could very well relate to Cath's obsession with her beloved Simon Snow books. I'm a fan of Cath and her passionate love for reading and writing Simon Snow fan fic. But I was no fan of Simon Snow himself (I haven't even read the last Harry Potter book). Every new chapter is accompanied by a Simon Snow quote or snippet of Cath's fan fiction to support the overall feel of Rainbow Rowell's FANGIRL and acquaint the reader with his magical world. These short snippets were fitting the stories' character and I liked to find out what Cath saw in Simon Snow's stories, what she loved about them. Towards the ending of FANGIRL the fan fiction portions of Cath's story grow in relation to one big event she's looking forward to. The publication of the last book in the Simon Snow series. So, long pages of FANGIRL are filled with Cath's fan fiction about Simon and his (as Cath writes it) potential love interest Baz. Even though Cath's characters seem to grow in correlation with the actual FANGIRL story, her Simon Snow fan fic filled too many pages to keep my interest. At some point I was tempted to skip the Simon Snow parts altogether and continue with the actual love story between Cath and Levi. Cath starting college is the perfect condition and setting for her to meet new people and maybe even fall in love. It's her chance to evolve and be independent but what if she is extremely shy and just wants to shut out the rest of the world except her sister Wren and her father? Cath is drawn back into herself and unaware of the college life going on around her. Luckily there are her new roomate Reagan and her friend, possible boyfriend Levi who help Cath to enjoy a small portion of life outside her bubble. Cath certainly doesn't become a social butterfly overnight, her transformation is a slow one, but she learns how to work on her issues and finally accepts new people into her life. Cath writes fan fiction, but always has a realistic and analysing gift when it comes to assess the people around her. The boys in FANGIRL don't come along born Gods, they don't have the shiniest teeth or most perfect features as Cath observes, who sees and likes them for the persons they really are. See for yourselves how Cath and Levi first met (their first encounters are probably unprecedented in YA awkwardness) and what their relationship is all about. Theirs is a very unconventional love story. It takes Cath a lot of time to open up to Levi and they become friends first before they can even give in to any romantic notions. To tease you, you can look forward to the Outsiders scene which is one of my favourites in YA! FANGIRL is not only about Cath's fan fiction and her love life. Rainbow Rowell found a bunch of other family and college-related aspects to weave together to a thick story mesh and well-written YA contemporary. It's about the many possibilities the new college world has to offer. About the difficulty to ever detach yourself from the ones you always had in your life as Cath's twin sister and their father mean the world to her. Is Wren doing okay on her own and what about her farther? Can he take to be all on his own after sending his two girls to college? And ultimately FANGIRL is about finding out who you really are as an independent person and how to make certain things exclusively your own. 4,5/5 ****/* FANGIRL - An authentic and wholehearted bibliophile college experience. Rainbow Rowell is the new YA phenomenon! FANGIRL is a brilliant book for readers looking for a YA contemporary read with the certain touch of magic. Sure I could've done without a good portion of the Simon Snow fan fiction we were given, but never would've wanted to miss out on FANGIRL. It's a very special read, with Cath and Levi's one-of-a-kind love story and Rainbow Rowell's great understanding for her characters.",MissPageTurner
9781250030955,"You know when you read a book that is so perfect you do not want to stop and then you wonder why you started that book at night and then it is 3AM and you know you need to sleep but you just keep reading. Just because. Because the book makes you happy. This book is FUN, BRILLIANT, AMAZING and so many more good adjectives. I have read all Rainbow Rowell books this year and every book is pure perfection, I can even decide which one is my favorite. Are you a fangirl? Have you ever been one? Of anything, a tv series, a band, a book. If you have been one, you can relate to Cath, a Simon Snow fan, fanfic writer, sister, friend and daughter. As a pro fangirl I think is really scary how much I can relate to Cath, she is awkward but she is still badass (not Reagan kind of badass though), and has so many thing in her mind that reminds me of myself like the whole thing of not knowing where some places are and staying in her building with the protein bars (in my case is coffee). Cath is dealing with her new life, college life. Everything is changing, her twin sister Wren is changing, her father is breaking down, her roommate is hard to read, her classes are different, she does not have enough time a day to write: to be a fangirl. And there is a boy.. in her room, outside her room with his tall, skinny figure and he talks a lot and smiles A LOT. And life is changing. Oh Levy. I freaking love him. If I ever meet a guy a little similar to him I will kidnap him. Levi is just Levi, the boy every girl needs and wants and if you say you do not you are probably lying. With his easy smiles, checked shirts an easy personality, he will become a friend to Cath, someone who will be there for her if she needs him, someone who actually listens to her and cares about what she is saying. I loved Cath and Levi relationship, they actually talk and Levi does not make fun of Cath and of what she likes and he does not care is she just a girl with her lazy pony tail, comfortable clothes and weird hobbies. And they are so cute, sweet and funny and and I have so many feeling for them. There are also other characters important characters that complete the circle of perfection that Fangirl is. I loved Cath and Wren'ss dad. He is.. interesting. From the start I loved his personality and the connection he has with Cath. I think Cath is his favorite daughter (every dad has a favorite do not even try to deny it), they are similar in character while Wren is more similar to Laura /ugh Laura/. And that is another thing that makes me relate to Cath, I always worry about my dad while my brothers and sister act more like Wren. Cath's roommate Reagan is the girl no one admits they want to be, but she is cool and does whatever she feels like doing, she is scary and has a strong personality that will make you like her from the start. Wren is nice... I probably disliked her (and Courtney) 70% of the book but I understand the whole change she had. I think Cath was going through similar things and they only chose different paths to deal with their problems. FANGIRL is a coming of age story that will make you see things how they really are, the realistic kind of college experience. Normal characters with real problems that the normal population has been through or is going through. There are tons of good things I could say about this book but I will just stop fangirling over it. I will probably read every Rainbow Rowell book until the end of times.",Laura
9781250030955,"Can I have 10 stars please!!! Just go buy it and read it. See if you don't think it's one of the best stories ever! For me, it's up there with Gayle Forman and John Green's books. Just One Day this year was one of those books that still has an effect on me. Anything John Green writes does that. I've had to start a new shelf. Special, Special Books. Anne Ursu also goes on that shelf. And so does Rainbow Rowell. The characters in this novel I loved them. I was jumping a little trying to edge Cath a little bit pushing her to go just a little bit further whether it was with her dad, Wren, Simon/Baz or Levi. I just wanted her to succeed at everything she tried. She just needed someone to pull her out of her shell, her tiny little world and somehow, she got paired with people that would help her with that. Levi, just like his name says, he's like a comfortable pair of old blue jeans. He's relaxed, broken in, easy going. He just seems to know what to say all the time. He's always smiling. He's, as Cath says, ""like a Golden Retriever"". I want Levi the Golden Retriever. He is absolutely the sweetest boyfriend I've ever read about. And thankfully Cath and Levi are drama free. And yet so captivating and engrossing. Then there's Cath's and Wren's relationship with each other, with their dad, with their mom, it's just so much about relationships. And there is a badass roommate that definitely would have scared me off my first year of college named Reagan that Cath lives with. Rainbow Rowell just seems to know people and how to write them so well. Being inside of Cath's head, it was so comfortable and when I thought I knew everything about her and how she felt, she still surprised me. I love Cath! And her fanfiction...I don't read fanfiction I have so much to read already. I've bought hundreds of books I haven't read yet. But I might start. I loved the Simon Snow fanfiction and he wasn't even a real story! I loved it!! I couldn't wait to read the stories. This is just an amazing story about college, about facing new and scary things. About leaving home and some of the pitfalls of that first year. Of first love and how scary that can be. And about living life by your own rules and other people being okay with that. You don't have to change who you are to be liked. And maybe your brand of crazy isn't that crazy at all. It's an amazing story that all lovers of contemporary YA and YA romance will love. I received a copy of this novel from the publisher for review through NetGalley. I was not compensated for my review. All opinions expressed are my own.",Heather Rosdol
9780061726835,"This book is just beautiful. The cover, the words, the characters, all of it beautiful. It's funny that in the world Lauren Oliver has created, love is a disease, something to be cured, and treated, love is exactly what I felt for Delirium. I absolutely loved it. This is one of those stories that you don't read everyday. It was something new and exciting. Every word in this has you hanging, dying to continue and find out what will come next. It was hard to imagine the world that Lena, Alex, and Hana live in. A world without love. It makes you realize how much it inhabits your life everyday and what it would be like without it. And that ending! Lauren Oliver, how dare you! I really cannot wait to sink into Pandemonium.",Rainy Days and Pajamas
9780061726835,"This book is aces. Seriously, this is a great read! It's one of those books where you literally have to know what happens next. I finished it within the span of a few hours, and I sincerely thank everyone who told me to read this book first! It's so interesting to watch Lena's transformation. She goes from this true believer of the cure, to this rebel. She's such an intriguing character. And than Hana, can I just say that I love Hana. She's a rebel until she needs to be, and to see Lena and Hana foil each other is pure genius on Oliver's part. This book kept me awake, and I love how original this book feels in a world where vampires and werewolves are quite dominant. Give this book a go, you won't be disappointed. I sure as hell wasn't! Final Thoughts: All I think I need to say is, I've already placed my order for the next book. Read this, now.",Kristen Buchanan
9780061726835,"The story world that Oliver built was a very believable one, backed up by the epigraphs at the beginning of every chapter. The concept of amor deliria nervosa was fresh, unique and so terrifying. Love, any kind of love, was a disease. Imagine any trace of affection erased from your world. It would be like talking to someone without really reaching out, without really connecting. The thought of being detached and being numb after getting cured, of not being the same person again, was too scary for me. Lena was an average girl. She liked to call herself 'in between' - not pretty nor ugly, just plain simple. Her mom committed suicide after remaining tormented by the disease after three attempts to get cured and since then, her aunt Carol took her and her sister, Rachel, in. She lived with them and acted as polite and obedient as possible. She has been counting down to the day of her procedure, the day when she would be cured at last. She looked forward to it, wanted to be safe from the disease, wanted to be safe from the fate of her mother. Lena was a likable character but I have to admit that in the beginning, I didn't like her that much. But Lena started changing after she met Alex. Alex was a guard working for the government. But there was something about his stance, his eyes and his words that convinced Lena that he was different. True enough, he was not a simple rule-following, rule-implementing guard, he was more than that. At first, there was just a mild attraction tossed in with irritation between the two. But his wild bright auburn hair, his gleaming eyes, his warmth and his natural charms made Lena fall for him. He was different from all the other boys - he was daring, thinking, laughing, feeling, and most of all, he was alive. Their relationship was the sweet first relationship sort with heightened intensity and urgency due to the danger and the risk they were in every time they were together but for the two of them, it was all worth it. I loved how Lena grew in Delirium. In the beginning, she was so eager to get the cure, so eager to be saved from the possibility of her having amor deliria nervosa and so against breaking the rules. But meeting Alex changed her in a way that meeting other people couldn't and wouldn't possibly do. She fell in love with him and amor deliria nervosa - the very thing that she wanted to be saved from - changed her. Together with Alex, she broke the rules, embraced freedom, life and love, and saw the world through a different lens. Instead of seeing a safe, secure and peaceful world, she saw an unfeeling, numb, detached world. Everyone seemed to have a bubble surrounding them, protecting them from the rest of the world and at the same time, preventing them from really touching, reaching out to people on a deep, emotional level. Delirium is a beautifully written dystopian romance that will sweep you off your feet. I love, love, love Lauren Oliver's writing. It's too beautiful! Fans of Matched by Ally Condie and Before I Fall will love this one. However, this book is more suited for readers who aren't looking for a kickass, action-filled, fast-paced dystopian. Delirium dwells on every moment of Lena's life. Imagine pausing a video and zooming inside the character's mind. I think that's the best way to describe it. I highly recommend it!",Precious
9780061726835,"I am tempted to extend my rating system to point out the unbelievable high status Delirium has claimed in my book collection. Even before I started reading Delirium I was nothing but excited and enthusiastic about this novel. Having the summary in mind, I expected this novel to be a rocket and it turned out to be a whole fireworks. Lena is the girl who respects each single rule of the totalitarian system. Alex is the rebel who doesn't respect one of them. Lena and Alex fall in love. And I love both of them! Although I already knew our protagonist Lena has to meet someone, somehow and fall in love with that person, I couldn't wait for it to finally happen. The story is told from Lena's point of view. She shares her thoughts with us and we live with her through months of enormous changes. She is struggling between her duty of social commitment and obedience and the new discovered option of free opinion and feelings. I felt a very strong connection to Lena and could always imagine how she's feeling. Alex is just the boy a society like Delirium's needs to get shaken to its very foundations: wild, passionate and empathetic. As a physical, psychical and emotional free citizen I immediately realized the cruelty and deviance of Delirium's social model and restrictions so it was very interesting to read about Lena changing her mind, learning about new living standards, love and feelings at all. Delirium has a large romance plot which isn't unusual for any other YA novel. But as the story around Lena and Alex is set in a dystopian world where America is shut down and love is considered as a disease, their romance isn't just unusual but dangerous, too. The romance and star-crossed lover motive are thrilling because their relationship is risky even deadly, not supposed to be, so that Lena and Alex do not only have to fight their own feelings or their families but a whole society. Their fight against society holds an enormous potential of anxiety and adventure because there couldn't be an enemy more gigantic. Delirium consists of a huge portion of excellent writing style. Lauren Oliver's writing style is vivid, throwing in a metaphor from page to page to benefit the novel's overall style. They beautifully enrich the tragic situation of story, setting and characters, never shooting over the top, never trying to play down or aestheticise society's cruelty. She puts the smallest and the grandest wonderful forces and objects together and matches them into something infinitely poetic and beautiful. Furthermore Lauren applies many references and adjustments to our society. I'd love to mention all my favourite quotes, but I would only end up reciting half of the novel. The most hilarious and best satiric adaptation: the 4th of July, America's present day of opening and independence is their day of isolation. At the beginning of each chapter Lauren Oliver quotes important moral guidelines of Delirium's society and so gives the novel authenticity. This dystopian novel shows the result of a paralyzed society which blurs into a mass of standardized shadows and the need for opposing forces. There are only a few shining lights left, trying to save the world as we know it from loosing its heart, its feelings, its humanity. Delirium is a novel of great feelings in a world in which feelings are forbidden! Start reading Delirium immediately and dive into an outrageous dystopian world, a captivating forbidden romance and into meaningful discourses of humanity and society! I am going to re-read Delirium just now because I don't want to leave this world so soon. Delirium immediately became one of my all time favourite novels and you all need to read it! So I say, either you buy it or you borrow it just now! Go and get it! THE VERDICT No words, just tears... Delirium represents the pure beauty of emotions and words of a novel in which love is considered as a disease.",MissPageTurner

9781471402883,"Dear Ava Dellaira, Your book broke my heart. I didn't know what to expect from Love Letters to the Dead when I started reading it, but it totally took me by surprise. It was hauntingly beautiful and raw and poignant that it made my heart ache over and over again. And I loved it. This book's a masterpiece. I really liked the style in which it was written. I liked the concept of writing letters to the people who were already gone, but somehow are still here with us. These people touched the lives of Laurel and her sister, May, in some way or another and I think it's only befitting that Laurel ""talked"" to them when she refused to talk to anyone. Actually, I struggled through reading Love Letters to the Dead. It was a difficult read for me. The story was sad and full of pain and I often found myself feeling a bit down. But what kept me glued to this book was the words. You write so beautifully, Ava. You have a way with words that make them alive. They're not just there tell us the story. They're there to make us feel the story. I also liked the honesty of the characters. Laurel was full of guilt, grief and anger but she didn't know how to let it all out. Sky - kind, mysterious and scarred Sky - was there but he couldn't help her, not really. Laurel had amazing friends, and though they were flawed and imperfect, they took her when she felt she had no one. Hannah, Natalie, Kristen and Tristan all had their own issues but they were funny and kind and caring and great friends to Laurel. I liked Laurel's character development, too. It may be a bit slow, but it's good that she finally got out of her sister's shadow and found her own self. This book poked holes in my heart. One of the most painful parts of the book was Laurel's letter to Kurt Cobain about his daughter. It made me cry. You perfectly captured the feeling of grief over losing someone and turned it into this magnificent story that touched us. Thank you for such a good story, Ava. It might be difficult, but it was beautiful and real. Thank you for the wonderful characters. Thank you for reminding me that ""we were here. Our lives matter."" Love Letters to the Dead is a book that will stay with me for a long time.",Julie Rimpula
9781471402883,"There has been a lot of hype surrounding this book so far this year, both on Tumblr and BookTube, so I??????C/??ve been super eager to pick it up. I'm so glad I did. When I started this book, I expected that there would be a letter here in there to break up the story, but no, the whole story was written in the format of her letters to various dead famous people. I was worried that I wouldn??????C/??t be able to lose myself in the storyline, and that the letters would feel disjointed and wouldn??????C/??t flow, but I was oh-so beautifully wrong. However, I have to mention that there were points in the book where I would forget who Laurel was writing to, so when she would directly reference them, I felt a little lost and had to go back to remind myself of who she??????C/??s talking to. I actually really liked Laurel. At times I was a little annoyed at her, but everyone grieves in different ways and Laurel??????C/??s way of getting through her sister??????C/??s death just happened to slightly irritate me. I loved her friends and family; they each brought something different to Laurel's character. I feel like May was sort of like Laurel??????C/??s manic pixie dream girl and this book was mostly about Laurel??????C/??s journey to recognising that her sister was not perfect. But rather that she was a terribly flawed teenager who was just trying to find her way through life, in the very same way that Laurel finds herself doing now. Towards the end of the book I started getting a little disillusioned with the plot and it ended up being a solid 4 star read. It was incredibly enjoyable and easy to get through.",TheBookHangover

When her English teacher sets the class an assignment of writing a letter to someone who has died, Laurel chooses Kurt Cobain ?C/?? her late sister?C/??s favourite singer. What starts as a piece of assessment turns into so much more. Laurel finds that she can tell dead celebrities all the things she keeps bottled up inside. Musicians, poets, actresses and even the voice of Mister Ed ?C/?? each of them means something different to Laurel. Though her letters to the dead, Laurel finds her voice. This book is a story about friendship, secrets, coming of age and grief. Laurel is grieving the loss of not only her sister but May was also her best friend and closest ally. It?C/??s hard for Laurel and changing schools so she can start anew with people who don?C/??t know about May only isolates her further. This book is at times a difficult read. Not for how it was written but because of the subject matter. In trying to cope with May?C/??s passing, Laurel makes some decisions which take her down some scary and dangerous roads. She is so young and comes across as so naive but the more we get to see Laurel?C/??s journey we see how hard her life was even before May died. Love Letters to the Dead is also about first loves. The romance in this book was so hopeful and optimistic with all the awkwardness and problems which come with teenage relationships. The depth of friendship is also explored and witnessing the ups and downs of these relationships was amazing. Laurel?C/??s friends may be unconventional and have their own things going on but they are still there for each other when they need it most. This book is beautiful written. Laurel?C/??s thoughts are poetic and poignant but her conversations with the living were often clumsy. Laurel?C/??s letters were never really to celebrities but rather a way to sort out her feelings of guilt and unhappiness. She grows so much over the course of the novel and it took a while for Laurel to come to terms with what happened. Her refusal to deal with May?C/??s death was portrayed in a realistic manner and Laurel?C/??s pain was palpable. There are pop-culture references scattered liberally throughout the novel and while there are recent ones, I wondered while I read it if this book would have been more appropriate if it had been set n the nineties. Kurt Cobain, his music as well as River Phoenix are a driving force behind many of the letters Laurel writes and there are times when I almost forgot this book was set in the present day. Despite this ?C/?? this book is still relevant to all those reading no matter when the references were popular. Love Letters to the Dead is a thought-provoking and emotional read. Dealing with some very adult issues like drug use, depression and death, this beautifully written book is both heartbreaking and moving.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9781471402883,"LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD is a poignant, touching, beautiful story of coming to terms with death and growing up. Of finding yourself among the wreckage and accepting who that person is--maybe even coming to love he or she. For me, this is a book that I highly recommend to everyone out there. Laurel, the teenage girl telling the story, is trying to deal with her sister's death. She does so by writing... to dead people, about everything that happens to her, and everything that has happened in the past. May, Laurel's sister, was almost a part of Laurel. She was so closely tied to Laurel's identity, to who Laurel wanted to be that without her, she's not sure who she is anymore. Her journey is an emotional one. One that makes you emotional on the way. She grows tremendously through the book, to the point that she stops trying to be someone else and just becomes herself. And herself is good enough. In fact, herself, to me at least, was beautiful. Alongside Laurel, there is an amazing cast of supporting characters - each rich and with their own interesting and unique story. And the prose of the entire story is absolutely stunning, and there are quotes I'll remember for the rest of my life. ""If beauty is truth, and truth is beauty, they are defined by each other, so how do we know the meaning of either?""",Nitzan Schwarz
9781471402883,"Did not finish: Stopped at 5% I wanted to read Love Letters to the Dead because it sounded like it would be an emotional story about Laurel healing and figuring out who she was. Besides the cover really catches my eye which doesn't hurt. I guess I was expecting something different though from Love Letters, and it is probably all my fault. I expected maybe a letter here and there, but that is the complete format of the book. And that is not my thing. I have a hard time connecting with Laurel and it felt like she was projecting a voice that really wasn't her, because we tend to put a better foot forward on paper, to someone else, even if they are dead. The obsession with Sky bothered me to, all we had was a glance and his looks. While I will admit I love a man in a leather jacket, there felt like there needed to be more. That isn't to say that the writing is poor or the characters are poorly constructed, it's personal on my end.

CHERUB is an organisation that was set up by Charles Henderson during World War II, training youngsters to become secret agents - because no one suspects a kid. The first two books have had Henderson, along with a handful of war orphans, scuppering the Nazi's plans to envade England. they have now made it back to Britain and set up a training facility. Secret Army folllows the first lot of kids through their training and a final test which will enable them to be allowed to be dropped into occupied Europe on actual missions.

9781620610077,"So, I hadn't ever read an Armentrout novel before. I'd heard amazing things about her work, but I was just, like, stuck. In the land of the dead, apparently. I just never got around to reading her before. And when I was browsing my libraries digital books, I saw Obsidian, then asked y'all if I should read it. I got a good response of yes! Read it. She's amazing, and so forth. So, I read it. And my verdict? I'm in love. I must now acquire all things Armentrout for my personal reading library! She is amazing with a capital zing! Katie and Daemon.....oh my god. I loved them both!!! I wasn't sure I would love Daemon as much as I did when I first was introduced to him in the story. He was a bit, um, overbearing? And Katie's reaction to him was a bit a stand-off-ish. But, as I read through the story and realized the connection they would have, I could look back and understand their attitudes. Ms. Armentrout incorporated them perfectly together for the story! Daemon was tall, dark, sexy. Katie was the book blogger (yea! She totally rocked, though I will forever out do her in my love of books!). Perfect combo. And the paranormal aspect to the story was beyond incredible! Definitely not your sappy werewolf vamp novels. The plotline that Ms. Armentrout chose was interesting and hooked me instantly. I was turning the pages long into the night....I just didn't want to put it down! And the ending.....THE ENDING!!! I was so surprised with the ending (y'all know I don't give out spoilers so don't expect me to tell you WHAT the ending was!) that I was like, really? That's it? I want more and I want more now! I thought that to myself and immediately went to the library site and checked out Onyx! Yea. I can't wait to read it! Definitely recommending this to everyone. It's a completely, utterly addictive read that you won't be able to put down. If I could give it more than 5 stars I most definitely would. Ms. Arementrout is the best and I can't wait to read the rest in this series!",Reviews By Molly
9781620610077,"This was a really fun book. Loved the sarcastic humor and the love/hate relationships. interesting take on the Blacks etc race...(don't want to spoil it for some). I found it to be a refreshing change to the oh-so-popular vampires, werewolves etc etc. The characters all had their different, loveable qualities and I have fallen in love with them all, a few more deeply (Daemon & Katy) than others (Ash & Andrew). With more than enough sarcasm and snarky remarks coming from the main two, there were a lot of loving, gentle moments too. Even some sexy. ;) The romance was not over-powerful or anything, not really anything that seemed over to top, but it managed to come through loud and clear. I loved awaiting what was going to happen next between the involved characters. I started and finished today and I wasn't board for a second reading this book and am eagerly awaiting my friend to lend me the second lovely novel tomorrow! I am odering them for my very own as well. ^_^",Teegan Leigh Mudge

9781620610077,"Obsidian has been on my radar for a while, and after so many good recommendations and a fantastic sale at Amazon, I couldn't resist. Now I know why almost everyone liked this book. Katy, the protagonist, is a book blogger, which of course made me kind of like her from the start, but she's not the typical dumb girl (of course not, she's a reader!), and Daemon, even when he is the typical sexy mysterious boy next door, he's irresistible. But in a way is very similar with other YA books: sexy paranormal boy, his family is also beautiful, her mom is never home and the protagonist is new at school. Also, she's pretty normal but of course the sexy boy thinks she's stunning. Ignoring that details, I really liked the writing. It was what got me from the beginning. It was easy to read, and it turned interesting very fast. There were some hot scenes, but for me it just made the relationship more realistic. Also, the Aliens haven't been really explored yet, so it was fresh, the Lux are very interesting. I really liked their story besides Katy and Daemon's romance. Overall, I read Obsidian very fast, it was fun and sexy, it was interesting from the beginning and I literally couldn't sleep until I finished it. Although it has many 'cliches', I still enjoyed it very much and recommend it.",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9781620610077,"Favourite Quote: ""To Daemon, my arrival was the beginning of the end. The apocalypse. Kat-mageddon."" I've read only one book by Jennifer L. Armentrout and it was her adult novel 'Tempting The Best Man' and I loved that so I decided to try out her YA novel and guess what? I LOVED IT TOO. Let's start with the characters, Katy was just your average teenage who loved to blog about books (she was a nerd, just like the rest of us) so I liked her straight anyway. Then I loved her because of her personality, she was witty, sarcastic, and funny. She was an awesome main character. Then there's Daemon who is just sex on legs (have you seen that cover!!!!) buuuuuut his personality is hot and cold. One moment he's flirting with Katy the next he's telling her she can't be friends with his sister. So yeah, I had a love/hate relationship with him. But overall I really did love him. The plot was original in my opinion, but I did personally see moments were I was reminded of Twilight, but that's not a bad thing (I loved twilight!). The novel was fast paced, with a lot of funny moments and witty dialogue. And the ending doesn't leave you on a cliffhanger but it does make you want to read the next book as fast as you can. So I definitely recommend guys!!! 5 stars!!!",brookexx
9780142426043,"My Life Next Door by Huntley Fitzpatrick is about Samantha, a seventeen years old girl who lives in a very strict family where everything has to be clean and in its own place. Ten years ago, new neighboors moved into the house next door. The new neighboors are the Garretts: a chaotic and messy family of eight children where laughter and affection is omnipresent. Needless to say that Sam's mother has always hated this family and it has always been prohibited for Sam and her sister to play with the Garretts. In spite of this interdiction, Sam likes to look at them from afar, until the time she gets close to Jase and becomes part of the family. This book is written in the point of view of Samantha, the main character. I have to say that I really liked her as a character even though sometimes I would not agree with certain things she would do. Yet, she stands up for her convictions and she is not scared of going through with them, especially by the end of the book, which I admire a lot about her. If I had to give only one reason to convince someone to read this book, it would be the Garretts. This family is just wonderful! They are full of life and loveable and they are all there for each others. But the cutest of the cutest is George, the four years old boy of the family. His dialogues with Sam are just the funniest thing ever and I laughed out loud a couple of times when reading them. The writing style was good and easy to read, nothing more, but it certainly did not lower the quality of the book. I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys a good temporary read once in a while. I certainly want to check out the author's other books.",Laurie Brousseau
9780142426043,"My Life Next Door is a great read. I liked Samantha as a main character, and I could feel her need to belong. She watches the Garretts, a loud and loving family next door, until she surprisingly gets lured into their life and discovers what her family seems to lack. I love the life portrayed by the Garretts, lots of noise, talking to one another, depending on each other, and the love that makes a house a home. Mrs. Garrett has the patience of a saint and is the mother that I hope to be. Jase is smart, funny and the more I read about him, the more I liked him. And youngster George is so concerned about life and just wants to be reassured. He says the cutest and funniest things, and makes me want to hug him. I like it when children are featured in books, and Ms. Fitzpatrick writes them wonderfully as she does the rest of the characters in the book. Tim and Nan were also great characters. They never failed to surprise me and they added real life and depth to the story. Tim went through such a transformation and that is exactly what I love to read about. I was sad at the direction that Nan and Sam's relationship took and I think that there should have been some resolution there. My Life Next door was exactly what I needed after a streak of darker contemporaries and then some dystopias. It was light at the right times, gave me the feel of summer that I am def. not getting here in real life, and it featured the family. It was not all light though, it deals with some pretty heavy issues in between the sweet romance between Samantha and Jase. Some issues that I didn't know what I would have done in Sam's place. And the thing that makes Sam's world fall out from under her feet? Something that I never saw coming! My only real complaint is that the story is left pretty open ended, and this is one where I wanted to know exactly what happened with the characters. Bottom line: Superb cast of characters and a sweet romance in this summery feeling contemporary.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780142415436,"Oh my heart still hurts from this one! I don't usually start reviews with talking about the ending but OH MY GOODNESS. I was a mess reading that last line, sobbing uncontrollably at 11PM on a Saturday night. Yep. So, let's now move back to the beginning. This story gripped me from that very first line: ""Everyone thinks it was because of the snow. And in a way, I suppose that's true."" Now, the blurb for If I Stay doesn't reveal too much, it just mentions choices and love so when I read the first line I instantly wanted to know what Mia was talking about. What did the snow do? I had my suspicions from reading reviews on Goodreads and I knew the plot was based on Mia losing something. Nevertheless, in no way was I prepared for the emotional onslaught reading this short book gave me. The chapters were not marked in the usual way and instead, time stamps were used and everytime I got to a new part I'd stop and think about what Mia was narrating. I did this because it gave me a lot to think about and I remember half way through this book something that Mia said hit me so hard that I cried for a long while. ""I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard."" I could fill an entire page with the quotes taken from this book because every single line was indescribably beautiful and so powerful. I have come to love Gayle Forman's writing. She was easily able to transition from Mia's out-of-body experience to the flashbacks and it wasn't choppy at all. It flowed well and gave me a helluva lot to think about. This is one of those books that will stick with me for a very long time! I know this is highly irregular but I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this book. The cover was simplistic yet lovely, the writing was incrediblely amazing, the feelings I got were overwhelming in the best way possible and the characters were incredibly endearing and I found it easy to feel what Mia felt and my heart broke for her, for everyone actually. All of her family, Adam, Kim and when the flashbacks came and Mia was remembering precious memories, I became a blubbering mess. She had a choice, which was the main point of this storyline. I wont tell you what the choice is because it's not hinted at in the blurb and I want you to go through the experience the way I did: knowing next to nothing. I could not even begin to imagine having that kind of choice to make, with everything that happened I don't know if I'd have been as brave as Mia was or as clear-headed. I understand she's a fictional character but still, the writing was so perfect it felt real and all those raw emotions were real too. So, I am 100% advising every single one of you who has not read this book to GO NOW to your local bookstore, library, amazon, bookoutlet etcetc and buy this. I know you wont regret it. I thought I wouldn't like it due to the hype surrounding this book even after almost 4 years but I adored it and it made it's way to my favourites. OH and good news for all the fans of If I Stay: There will be a movie!!! August 22nd I believe, the trailer (which I have obsessively watched a billion and one times) is on my 'Books To Movies' tab so go ahead and take a look. Then tweet me and fangirl with me! It looks amazing, so close to the book and the song (Say Something) was just made for this story. Chloe Mortez looks the part, as do Adam and Mia's parents and I just can't wait. It doesn't look like it'll be a disappointment but I'll be sure to do a review when I've seen it. Okay, please follow me on google+ (as a way of being able to see all my new updates on here), Twitter and Goodreads which are all linked to the side of this page and on the Home page too! I would love to have you guys give me some reccommendations and I'd also love to just chat with you all! This is a great community but I barely get to speak to many of you, so please don't hesitate to message me on any of my social networks:). PS. Please oh please ignore this: ""Will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyers' TWILIGHT."" which appears on the cover of If I Stay. In no way does this book remind me of Twilight, absolutely no way. I don't know what those people were on but consider that suggestion absolute rubbish. PPS. Before reading this book, be prepared. You will need: boxes(and boxes and boxes) of tissues, a big tub of ice cream, some more tissues, 1 person to vent to and then maybe a couple more tubs of ice cream. You are welcome.",Amber Smith
9780142415436,"Source: Borrowed from the library I belong to the Penguin Loves YA group over at Goodreads and for July the book pick was the dualogy If I Stay and Where She Went by Gayle Forman. There is a movie coming out (August 22) and so I wanted to read the series before the movie came out. I borrowed it and began reading without delving into the synopsis. From the first sentence, I was in the grips of this book. I did not want to put it down. I'm sure that I did for brief moments to switch the laundry or make dinner but it was a page turner. Not in the traditional, who-dun-it mystery sense. No...Forman created a quirky, wonderful family that in just a matter of pages you fell in love with. Then Forman destroys it. And as a reader, I felt like I was there. The shock and the horror and the sorrow were genuine emotions that consumed me. I read quite a bit and enjoy most of what I read. This is a book that I enjoyed not because it was full of feel-good, happy-ever-after bliss. No, it was because Forman expertly captured human emotion. At the beginning, I thought the book would be whether Mia would choose to go to New York and pursue her education at Julliard or stay closer to her boyfriend Adam. It wasn't as simple as that. And of course, Mia chooses to stay -- but it is not clear at the end if she chose to stay with Adam or not. So I began the second book thinking it was going to pick up very shortly after the first. I was wrong - but happy to be. Where She Went is told from Adam's perspective and takes place three years later. It shows how Adam has suffered because while Mia chose to stay, she didn't stay with him. Just like the first book, this book was emotionally gripping. It also focuses on a very brief span of time; the latter portion of the book explores one night where Mia and Adam reunite. Forman again shows her skill as an author by showing the healing that Mia has been experienced during the past three years as well as Adam's acceptance of what he hasn't been able to deal with in the same time frame. I am so glad that these books crossed my radar. They are incredibly well done and are on my best of list for the year. I am not sure if I am looking forward to the movie or not. I haven't watched the trailer or anything because I just don't want to spoil the effect of reading the book. For readers, movies rarely are as good as the book and I admit that I am not sure how the movie could even come close.",Cassie Larson
9780142415436,"After a car accident leaves Mia in a coma, she starts to think about what life holds for her. Her parents are gone and some of the choices she has to make seem to be just too hard to even think about considering. But as the machines keep her body alive, her spirit walks the halls of the hospital seeing the people she loves and reminiscing about days gone past. With college looming and having decide between the love she has for music and the boy that holds her heart, Mia needs to decide. If she goes she can be with her family... but if she stays? Well that remains a mystery. This is one of those devastating stories about loss and love. And I adored the way love was portrayed in this novel. Not necessarily the love between main character Mia and her boyfriend Adam but the love between families. Mia's parents were shown though flashbacks to be supportive and generous in the way they felt about each other and their children. Their passion for music and life was infectious. Despite these characters not being present in the present tense, reading their interactions through Mia's memories were one of my favourite parts of the book. Like wise the love shown between friends - like Kim and Willow. I found it hard to engage with Mia - but considering she was disconnected from the world I'm not surprised that I was disconnected from her. Even though her flashbacks I found her to be a little standoffish and lacking the vibrant energy in which she describes her family and friends as having. That said, her narration does deliver a well rounded and full picture into her life and her music. Her relationship with music and love was beautifully written and I thought it was a very interesting way to look at the world. This is a beautifully written novel about love and life. It kind of snuck up on me. I didn't think I was into this story but I started to tear up during one of the scenes (it was the one when Gramps came in to talk to Mia) and I had to reach for the tissues. I've heard such great things about Gayle Forman's books and I'm so glad that I decided to read one. I will definitely be on the look out to read more from this fantastic YA author.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780142415436,"I must say that I was quite excited to read this book. I wanted to read something that would possibly be emotional and I was hoping this would be one of them. The book started off ok and then I must say I was quite bored. I couldn't quite get into it. The story felt like it was all over the place not in a bad or hard to keep up way, but I felt like the book was just felted with background information of the past. I wanted to her more about Mia's feeling and decision. Although I didn't like those things about the book. It was good writing and it had some great moments. I will continue to the second book, but I must say isn't anyway at the top of my list.",Chapman
9780142415436,"In IF I STAY Gayle Forman confronts us with a precarious and more than difficult decision that has to be made. Leave this world forever or stay and try to rebuild the ruins of your life? After the horrible car accident that led to the death of her family, Mia is in a coma. She is the girl in between. Told from her perspective, Mia's constantly reflecting on the sequences that have defined her life so far and compares them to her current situation. There are moments with her family, simply eating breakfast, or her falling in love with her boyfriend Adam. I had high hopes in the relationship between Mia and Adam. I imagined it to be romantic and epic, but I felt just slightly entertained by Mia's retelling of some of their relationship highlights. Tough Adam was the person I liked most in IF I STAY. He is sweet, has inner strength and is willing to fight for Mia no matter what. But unfortunately I just didn't click with the other characters. Mia's parents felt too alternative for my taste. Nonetheless I find it helpful and necessary that Gayle Forman includes moments of their lives and retells the most important stations to offer the reader a glimpse of what could be forever lost to our torn protagonist Mia. And torn is exactly how I felt about Mia, too. On the one hand I totally got how she felt about this whole messed up situation. On the other hand I couldn't really identify with her character. Her life- as her parents' lives- is highly dominated by music. She's so passionate about her violin and I admire her for that. People who are interested in music the same way Mia is should like this read a lot. I might not have cared about the characters as much as I'd wanted to, but the overall discourse definitely affected me and made me think a lot about what I would have done if I had been in Mia's situation. THE VERDICT 3,5/5 ***/* IF I STAY- A philosophical discourse about the safety of life and the security a family offers. Gayle Forman tells the story of Mia with the right amount of sensibility and beautiful piano notes contributing a soundtrack to the sad story.",MissPageTurner
9780142415436,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2012/07/24/review-if-i-stay-by-gayle-forman/ I've been letting this book sit in my head for the past few days because I really can't put my feelings about this book into words. So I'll settle for a very vague word: indescribable. If I Stay is purely indescribable. The characters in this novel could be my best friend, your best friend, someone's best friend's best friend ... They are so realistic that I think that if I tried to touch them, I'd feel living flesh. The complexity of these characters just astounds me. Mia is quiet, shy-but she's incredibly dedicated to playing cello. I don't often read music geeks in novels anymore, but I always love when I do. I'm a violin player myself, though I'm not very devoted to music; however, my best friend has been in love with her piano since she was 4. And since I don't have that kind of connection with my own music, I'm curious: I want to know what that special kind of happiness is. So far, I've only been able to compare it to my love of reading and writing. I'd say that it's this wonderful feeling that trembles in your body; it's something you can cherish and makes your heart burst. Utter joy. Mia's relationships with others are also incredibly unique, and you know that I'm a big fan of unique. She and her best friend, Kim (who is the queen of sarcasm), were originally mega-enemies; they didn't like each other just because everyone thought they should be best friends. But after one fight, they became instant buddies. Mia and her little brother, Teddy-who is absolutely adorable, let me tell you-are thick as thieves. And Mia and her parents are practically polar opposites; her dad was once a rock band drummer, and her mom is a total rocker chick. Obviously, with Mia's interest in classical music, their tastes clash. But the four of them make a hilarious family. Here is a description of the typical young adult book boyfriend: dark, steamy, handsome, hawt ... you get the point. They're supposed to knock you off your feet. So guess what the guy-Adam-does in this book? No, he doesn't knock you off your feet. But he is so incredibly sweet. Little things here and there just make you fall for him-like Mia did-before you even realize that you fell for him-like Mia realized. Their relationship is so un-cliched that I want to leap for joy. Because they get in fights too. They have their differences too (Adam plays in a rock band). They are just a regular teenage couple-but the two of them are just so deeply in love I want to cry. But the part I loved the most about this book: the lesson. 'Cause the cover pretty much sums it up with that one question: what would you do if you had to choose? If you were in a car accident, if your parents were dead, if your little brother might be on the verge of death, if you were stuck in a coma, if you knew that there was nothing for you if you came back except for a boyfriend and a best friend and a few relatives ... would you choose to live or die if you had the choice? It's a deep question. Right now you might say, ""I'd choose to stay, of course,"" but think about it. Take a deep breath and sit back and just think. You would be a seventeen-year-old orphan. Your life would definitely not be the same as it was before the accident. Would you really want to stay? Because, remember, you can't take back your choice. You're stuck with it. And before you say, ""Of course Mia chooses to stay; I mean, after all, there is a sequel,"" I'd like to point out that the sequel takes place from Adam's point of view three years later. But you might not want to read the synopsis for that, because it'll definitely spoil If I Stay. Deep and engrossing, If I Stay is a must for any reader. Such an emotional novel is guaranteed to kindle a response to the biggest choice one could possibly have: to live or to die. Source: Paperback received from giveaway",Linda

Once you've finished reading it, you'll keep this book forever and read it over and over again. The innocent viewpoint was what made this book special to me, with so much pain and death surrounding WWII, John Boyle does a wonderful job to capture it in a different light.

9780385751537,"""What exactly was the difference? he wondered to himself. And who decided which people wore the striped pajamas and which people wore the uniforms?"" (pg. 100) A story of pure innocence and the power of seeing the world through a child's eyes, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a simple study of the injustice of WWII. This is a moving and powerful tale that takes a subject such as this large war and takes it down to an elementary scale that our youth can better understand. I give this five stars because, had I read this in my youth, I would easily want to read it again. Even at the age I'm at now, I wouldn't mind reading it again to look more for the symbology and allusions. ""a~The thing about exploring is that you have to know whether the thing you've found is worth finding. Some things are just sitting there, minding their own business, waiting to be discovered. Like America. And other things are probably better off left alone."" (pg. 114) I initially picked up this book, although it's been on my to-read list for some time, because my youngest brother had to read it for school. I read it to help him, but really, although he's only a few chapters in so far, he's helped me. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how Bruno was mispronouncing ""Out-With"" and didn't know what he was supposed to be referencing; my youngest brother, through a discussion in his class, told me that it's supposed to be a concentration camp called Auschwitz, one of the largest concentration camp networks that killed an estimated 1.1 million people. After this realization I started thinking of this book in a different way. For example, I don't remember Hitler being called ""The Fury,"" as well as I couldn't make out whatever derogatory name the soldiers were calling the jews in the book. The Fury is Bruno's misunderstanding of ""Der F 1/4 rer"" and if I did re-read this book I must keep in mind to read it through the eyes and understanding of a child. I have to say, on that point, that a nine-year-old (today, at least) would be a little more aware of their surroundings and what's really going on, based off of whatever they overhear from adults. ""a~We should never have let the Fury come to dinner,' she said. a~Some people and their determination to get ahead.'"" (pg. 40) This book is a great, simple introduction to children, towards the study of the Holocaust and the travesties of the second world war.

9780385751537,"What an incredible story! John Boyne has created innocent, na-ve Bruno and given him a powerful story to tell. This moving book should be required reading for everyone. Set in the 1940's in Berlin, Germany, the story centers around a nine-year-old German boy named Bruno. His family leaves Berlin to move to the country because his father has been reassigned by the ""Fury."" Bruno's youth and innocence has protected him from the harsh realities of Hilter and his reign of terror. Life in the country is dull and boring for Bruno. He doesn't understand his new home, ""Out-With."" He's left his friends behind and doesn't like the smaller house he's forced to live in with his parents and his sister. Missing the hustle and bustle of the city, Bruno begins to explore his new surroundings. Beyond the fence near his house, he sees people, but is confused by their strange striped pajamas and their sad demeanor. Bruno's loneliness is somewhat relieved when he becomes friends with a boy on the other side of the fence. They meet daily and exchange comments about their daily lives, but neither fully understands the circumstances of the other. Boyne presents a story about the Holocaust like none other before. He brings tragedy to life through the eyes of innocent children. Readers of all ages will be spellbound until the last page and beyond. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

It really makes you angry, the thought of how controlling the government could get. The whole story is wonderful, I loved how easily the characters fell into place, it just felt right.

9780141334783,"If it is possible to be both a self-confessed pessimist and a hopeless romantic then that's me. This is perhaps why Matched appealed to me so very much. Matched is a young adult dystopian romance which brings many Orwellian questions home to a younger audience. These days the idea of Big Brother brings to mind a voyeuristic television show where exhibitionists parade around a glaringly bright house, making fools of themselves in hopes of making a quick buck. Thankfully, Condie reminds us what Orwell and Huxley were trying to say with their original dystopian masterpieces. She takes familiar ideas of society being controlled by government indoctrination and propaganda, and manages to rejuvenate them. The pessimist in me thoroughly enjoyed hating the society in which Cassia, the heroine, lives. It is a society which controls where people work, when they die, how many children they have and even who they love. Of course, anyone who has ever had a crush on completely the wrong person, (and surely that's everyone?) knows that love and lust cannot be weighed and measured. It cannot be controlled. Matched provides an interesting love triangle between the three main characters. Cassia and Xander are matched and you are glad that they are! Xander seems like a great guy: a sensible choice. But what teenage girl, what woman, chooses ""sensible"" when shown the option of ""mysterious"" and ""exciting""? Ky provides both and is the proverbial spanner in the works. As a reader I was drawn into this triangle and really felt for Cassia. Because hers is a tough choice! I found myself rooting for both the male leads, especially at first. The underlying conflict of the seemingly ""ideal"" society of Matched, works to beautifully highlight the conflict raging in Cassia's own heart. We live in a world where we are pretty much always on somebody's CCTV, where advertisements corner us from every form of media, and where Internet dating sites tell us that they can ""match"" us to a perfect partner based on deep aspects of our personalities. Matched is a poignant and intelligent book which will leave you both asking questions and positively drooling for the sequel.",Laura Williams

We recently brought it again for our children who are 5 and 7 who can't see it often enough. We then brought the book which is better than the movie, even. A fast paced, funny, romantic tale with everything you could want from an adventure story and more. The characters are larger than life and easy to like and believe in and the whole thing is a bundle of fun. We read it as a family at bedtime and my kids happily, quickly get ready for bed so we can read (if you are a parent you will understand the magnitude of this sentence) It is that good. We love the back story of all the characters that is enlarging our view of their World. The language is a delight and it works well as a read aloud book as well as a read to yourself book. It is full of humour and some of the characters have the same words as the movies, which the children think is magical. The one thing they didn't like was that it is sharks instead of shrieking eels in the book and they feel that the movie should have been true to the book.

9781905654291,"I finished this book in two sleepless days. Like the other books, Breaking Dawn is a very dangerously addictive read. This book answers all the questions about Bella's vampire status and her romance with Edward. Breaking Dawn deals with mature subjects such as sex although since the saga was written for young adults, ""it"" never explicitly revealed (such a shame really...it's Edward Cullen we're talking about here!). After a brief engagement and perfect vampire-ish wedding, the horny newly wed, Bella & Edward, eloped to their honeymoon (in an island belonged to The Cullens, what else) and made love even tough Bella was still a human. Of course there was a consequence (yes, even if they do it after they were pronounced as a husband and wife) which Bella has to pay dearly for the next couple of weeks in scenes so garishly close to ""The Exorcist"". To top it off, there are another conflict between the werewolves pack where ultimately push Jacob to take side. Jacob also play a more pivotal role and has few whole chapters described from his point of werewolf-ish view. Bella's metamorphosis from fragile human being to become a strong vampire is also written convincingly. In the end, Breaking Dawn is a well-written closure for the vampire saga. Stephenie Meyer deals with the mature subjects (and anxious parents who doesn't want their daughters to read love story and sex out of wedlock) with a sensibility.",Evelyn Tedja

9781907410369,"First I was outraged... who the hell Steph Meyer thinks she is to write a short story about a character that appears for 5/10 minutes in Twilight's Universe instead of working on the much wanted and left unfinished on the shelf ""Midnight Sun""? But then I thought why not? Is twilight related, and is online free - at least till 5th July And I'm sooo glad I've read it. I like Bree a lot. She's no dull veggie vampire. She's the real thing - despite of the sparkling on the sun, but hey, don't forget is twilight. She didn't have the choice to become a vampire, but she manages the best she can, trying to survive one day at a time. This book clearly benefits from being the fifth on the series, and a short one. The characters are strong and it has no time to be boring. Vampires lie. Vampires deceive. Vampires fight and kill humans just because they can. Vampires are cruel. They are immortal, and sometimes they love. An Eclipse's spin-off better than the original.",Sonia Carrao
9781907410369,"So I read The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner a few months back and I read it in two days I really thoroughly enjoyed it. Stephenie gives us a real insight as too what newborn blood thirsty vampires are really like and shows us the emotions they go through since we have recondition of this in The Twilight Saga (Twilight, New moon, Eclipse and Breaking dawn) we do hear a tiny bit of what Jasper's life was like in Eclipse and what it was like for him but as all the books are in Bella's perspective we are not really able to know what it is like and this book reveals all. Starting with Bree we all know she surrenders herself to Carlisle in Eclipse that was the first we read of her little did we know that she would have her own novella. When I started reading The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner I started to see a side of her that I thought wasn't even possible and I read on more I started to really like her character she isn't the evil new born we all thought she was but a young vulnerable girl that Riley kills for Victoria's army. Bree becomes good friends with another vampire Riley has created and by reading it you can see they are starting to fall for each other. When I read it I cried that Bree died because I really didn't want her too even though I knew she was going to die. The vampire that Bree starts to have a close bond with is Diego. Though they only started to really bond in one day it shows you they are intense about each other. Diego was another character I started to really like in the book. When I read he was dead it felt like an important character was gone. I had started to really like reading about Bree and Diego and although both of them die it's kind of like a love story for them. I would have loved for them to both stay alive. There is a vampire called Fred who has quite an unusual gift. He is interesting because his gift has never been known to us. Fred can make vampires stay away from him, he can make vampires feel like they are repulsed if they go near him. He is also very quiet that some vampire would not know he exists. Near the end of the book he pulls Bree to one corner when they are leaving to go to the clearing and asks her to away with him to not fight and to leave Riley but we know she doesn't because Riley has told her that Diego is waiting for her at the clearing and she wants to go see him so Fred leaves on his own and asks her to meet him the next day if she survives. We get to see a close friend-ship that could have been if Bree had been kept alive between Bree and Fred. The character who I ended up hating and was glad that dies was Riley. In Eclipse all we find out about him is that he loves Victoria and thinks she does to. But we know she doesn't. We read that Riley in fact kills Diego and doesn't tell Bree. He lies to her the whole time. To me at the start before he changes her he kind of manipulates her. I am really glad he died. In the book there is a surprise that everyone had no idea about! The Volturi pay a visit to Victoria. We know this as Bree and Diego are close to the house to where Victoria is staying when they arrive. The Volturi knew exactly what Victoria was up to and told her to make sure she succeeds in killing the Cullen's. We know Edward finds this out as Bree thinks it so she can tel him everything she knows. To me The Second Short Life of Bree Tanner is a must-have for all Twilight Saga fans. It was an amazing story that I could read and read again. With surprises, knowledge and a great insight to blood thirsty new born vampires!

9781907410369,"For Bree life began in a burning flame of agony, before that all her memories are dark and murky. With the life Bree led as a human it is hardly surprising she prefers life as a strong and powerful vampire. But life as an all but immortal 'God' is not all its cracked up to be. As a newborn Bree spends most of her time thinking about feeding, with the constant thirst burning in her throat there is little chance for anything else. But a series of events will lead her to question all that she has been taught about her new life and she comes to realise that she is being kept in the dark in more ways then one. The Short Second Life Of Bree Tanner is a bitter-sweet Eclipse Novella highlighting a life of a girl smart enough to discover a truth no one is able to see, but not quite strong enough to walk away when she had the chance. If a vicious and violent newborn is able to find friendships and love where her human self could not then her second life as a vampire, as short as it was, was well worth the pain.

9780312642969,"Took me long enough to get around to this sequel, right? I'm sorryyy. But I'm here now, ready to put my piece of mind out there and reaffirm that, yes, this is an awesome book and an awesome sequel for an awesome series. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite series, guys. First off, I want to give serious praise to Marissa for her ability to create interesting, captivating characters. Introducing new (main) characters after the series has already started is quite a difficult thing. And most times, for me at least, it doesn't work. But Scarlet is awesome. Wolf is amazing. Thorne is constantly entertaining. I really couldn't find a negative thing to say about them. My biggest hesitance going in was that I wouldn't like the story not being fully focused on Cinder - but that was absolutely not an issue. Switching between the different characters and storylines was seamless and truly skillfully done. Marissa Meyer's writing style and world building are of a level one would not normally expect in YA. Seriously flawless. Especially the world. My sci-fi loving heart was overjoyed with the detail and skillful crafting that presented itself in this novel. I want more of the world. I just want to go back to it. It's been a while since I haven't had questions because of lackluster world building that left big plot holes. So, seriously, two thumbs up for that. The plot in this one was amazing. I honestly didn't want to put the book down for most of it. I loved how creatively different this retelling of Red Riding Hood was. I swear, I was reading most of it with this huge grin on my face because the quality was just so high. The story is just action-packed, intriguing, and totally captivating. And that means all the different storylines, not just Cinder's or Scarlet's. And getting a glimpse of Kai and the political situation every once in a while was such a big plus and really showed how well Marissa thought the whole story through. I just loved it! So I found Scarlet to definitely be an action-packed thrill ride, but ultimately was a bit let down by the last portion of the book. How do I describe my frustrations without spoiling things? Hmm. At a certain point, the story just gets a lot more violent and brutal, graphically so. It did not fit my expectations of the novel, and instead of really pulling me in even more (or causing me to gasp or cry or whatever the intention was), I was a bit turned off. And I couldn't really understand why the story was going that way. It was just creepy. And my dislike for *cough* werewolf paranormal kind of stories may have had a role in this. ...Cryptic enough? Anyway, this means the last part of the book was less pleasing to me and ultimately explains the rating. Summing Up... Marissa Meyer doesn't disappoint with this action-packed sequel to Cinder. Scarlet is fast-moving, entertaining, and packs a punch with its awesome characters and awesome world. If you haven't read this series yet, you need to get caught up. Recommended To... Any YA reader with the slightest interest in the sci-fi genre. Seriously, though, everyone. Basically.",Unknown
9780312642969,"I, like many other Marissa Meyer fans, have waited longingly for over a year to read Scarlet. I did not even request an ARC of the novel because it came out a day before my birthday, and it made the perfect gift. (There is no denying that the temptation to get my hands on an ARC was strong.) When the book came in the mail, I petted it - LITERALLY petted it! It has ridden in my purse for a week, just so I can snatch moments to devour the pages. It was a whirlwind romance. Sadly though, it did not sweep me off my feet. I'm so sorry, Scarlet - it's not you, it's me. No, I mean it, it really must be me. Scarlet had all of the fantastic qualities that Cinder had: strong heroine; Iko; fantastic mix of sci-fi and fairy tale (Meyer is beyond genius in her execution of this); Iko; deliciously evil villainess; Iko (you see where I'm going with this). Little Red Riding Hood is even one of my favorite fairy tales! Scarlet and Wolf had all of the makings of interesting literary characters, but I found myself resenting the time given to their story. The banter between Cinder, Captain Thorne, and Iko (and all combinations thereof) was delightful. Maybe it was just me wanting more of Cinder and her story that disrupted my enjoyment of the novel. Scarlet wasn't a bad character - she was just as strong and determined as Cinder. I just had trouble connecting with her after I spent so long waiting to rejoin Cinder on her journey. I can say that Wolf is far too broken of a bad boy for my taste, and maybe it was the mom in me that wanted to smack Scarlet for taking him along. All griping aside, Meyer's world-weaving is genius. The most fun part of reading Meyer's works are figuring out where her storytelling intersects with the original fairy tales. I started reading the novel asking myself questions like, ""Does Wolf want to eat grandmother?"" and ""Where is the huntsman?"" I did not find all of my answers, but I can tell you without giving anything away that Little Red Riding Hood lives on grandmother's farm, and the Big Bad Wolf is a street-fighter with a Big Bad Secret that could potentially affect the entire world. Grandmother is also in possession of some secrets of her own, which wove the story in Scarlet well into The Lunar Chronicles. I loved being introduced to more of this futuristic Earth, and I honestly cannot wait to read Winter, which is supposed to be set on the moon. The fact that Scarlet did not completely work for me makes me no less a fan of The Lunar Chronicles, and I can still happily say it is the one of the most imaginative series currently being published. I'm dying to give Marissa Meyer another chance to make me swoon with Cress. Scarlet is an important building block for the series as a whole, and I will definitely reread it at a later date to see if my bad-naturedness truly played a part in my feelings about this book.

An unlikely ally comes in the form of a cell mate named Captain Carswell Thorne and together they try to find out the mysterious circumstances around Cinder's life before she was a cyborg mechanic from New Beijing. Picking up just after Cinder left off, I thought it was fantastic how this story evolved during this novel. It's so easy to forget that Cinder is a sixteen year old girl. She acts with a lot of maturity and a level head - even in the midst of a prison break! I love how her character is growing and I'm excited to see what happens next for her now that she's embracing her Lunar heritage. Her new companion Carswell Thorne (excuse me - that's Captain Carswell Throne) is a laugh. He reminded me a little of my four favourite fictional captains (Brannigan from Futurama, Reynolds from Firefly, Harkness from Torchwood and Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean). I loved his comic relief and the snarky, snarly sarcastic banter exchanged between him and Cinder. The addition of some of my favourite characters from the first book, Iko and Kai, really added to the excitement. The new story of Scarlet and Wolf was interesting. There's a lot of new drama regarding their relationship and the disappearance of Michelle - who is more than just a granny from a small vegetable growing farm. Everything is ramping up in terms of story - I loved how the seemingly separate lives of Cinder and Scarlet are connected. There's a lot of action and a dash of romance too.

9780312642969,"I can't really go into everything I loved about Scarlet because it would be as long as the book. Seriously. All the characters, all the POVs, all the anguish and suspense and utter torment are SO worth it. I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest, and I'm sure you'll feel the same way as I do. I have no idea how I'm going to function for a year as I wait for Cress. Literally. I'm like, listless. I can't stop thinking about this book. Maybe it was the fact that I read it in half a day, that it was too much all at once? Ya, so don't overdose on this book. Space it out a little, like give it two days. I'm just going to focus on characters because I don't want to give too much away about the story for those who haven't read the first book. Cinder: I missed her. I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy this book as much because it wouldn't just be her and Kai's POVs anymore, but don't worry! There's just enough of her in this. I feel like she's got a lot of growth ahead of her as she tries to figure out the ethics of using her gift. What she does in this book will be just the tip of the ice berg. Plus she is so friggin badass. She doesn't take **** from anyone. Prince Kai: I feel SO bad for him in this book as he struggles with his feelings for Cinder, whether it was all a glamour or if he really likes her. I'm not going to go into any more because he only has a few chapters, the last of which will probably kill you. Scarlet: Another character who won't take **** from anyone. She's a girl on a mission (to find her grandmother) and she's not going to let anyone stop her. I love her red hoodie, I love her hair, I love her attitude, I love her relationship with Wolf, I just love her. It seems to me like she's got her priorities straight, and she won't let anyone dissuade her when she's got her mind fixed on something. Captain (Cadet) Carswell Thorne: I'm semi-confused about who he's supposed to be in this fairy-tale adaptation, but he comes across as very Flynn Rider-ish to me, so hopefully I've pegged him right. This guy is hilarious, and his relationships with Cinder (him purposefully bugging her, Cinder making scathing remarks back) is spot on and perfect. It doesn't feel threatening to the feelings that Cinder has for Kai. I'm not sure how that will change in the books ahead. Wolf: I was so confused with his story line because new things were introduced, and he kept adding more information, and Scarlet found out other things about him, so that when there's this big reveal, it's like BAM! Death. In a good way. He was the source of mystery in this book. I just want to note that the pacing is very different than Cinder. The first book set everything up: the world, the characters, and the conflict. Scarlet picks it up, has tons of action mixed in with some slower, more reflective moments. It's the perfect balance, and it's the perfect second book. It manages to satisfy some elements from the first book while introducing new conflicts and mysteries for the next books. Cinder was to The Fellowship of the Ring as Scarlet is to The Twin Towers. That's the best analogy I can come up with. The whole time you'll be leaning into the book, waiting for the moment when the two storylines will collide. And they do, so perfectly. I would give this book a 6/5, but that would screw up my rating system. So 5/5 for my favourite series. I can't wait for Cress.",Janita Van Dyk
9780440416777,"""And I think every once in a while someone comes along who is a little more primitive than the rest of us, a little closer to our beginnings, a little more in touch with the stuff we're made of."" Finally, a book that I was able to really connect with. It's refreshing and honest and real. It's simple yet not so simple. Raw and profound. I loved every moment I was reading this book. Stargirl (the character) is weird, but it's a good weird. She's unique and innocent and true to herself. I loved her personality, her carefree attitude, her kindness. I loved how she treats everyone nicely, even when they're mean to her. ""Of all the unusual features of Stargirl, this struck me as the most remarkable. Bad things did not stick to her. Correction: her bad things did not stick to her. Our bad things stuck very much to her. If we were hurt, if we were unhappy or otherwise victimized by life, she seemed to know about it, and to care, as soon as we did."" Her ways of expressing herself were different and her boldness and not caring what others think made people uncomfortable. She showed them something new and at first, they loved her for it. But when they didn't know what to think of her anymore, they shunned her and turned her into an outcast. What made me sad is that Leo did not stand up for Stargirl - the real Stargirl. He wanted her to be normal. He wanted her to be just like everyone else. What Leo did not know - or perhaps wasn't willing to acknowledge - was that her uniqueness was what made her Stargirl. I wanted to be mad at Leo, but I understood him. I think he was just afraid to stand out by being associated with Stargirl. I liked the fact that Leo was the one narrating the story. It gave more emphasis to Stargirl's character because she was seen from the outside. Leo's voice was also strong and steady. I liked the words, the dialogue, the flow of the story. I loved it to the last page. ""You can't just wake up in the morning and say you don't care what the rest of the world thinks."" No, Leo. Actually, you can. And Stargirl did just that. Personally, what I liked the most about Stargirl is that I see a bit of myself in her. Like Stargirl, I don't think much about what other people think. It's liberating and happier that way. I really admire Stargirl for being herself and even though she tried to change and be just like everyone else, she did it for love. How blind of Leo to not see Stargirl's worth. At least not enough to choose her over everyone. Stargirl is definitely a must-read. A new favorite book. Favorite lines: ""The trouble with miracles is, they don't last long."" ""Nobody has the time,"" she said. ""The time cannot be owned."" She threw out her arms and twirled till her multicolored skirt looked like a pinwheel taffy. ""The time is free to everyone!"" ""Ita??s really hard to do nothing totally. Even just sitting here, like this, our bodies are churning, our minds are chattering. Therea??s a whole commotion going on inside us."" a??Thata??s bad?a?? I said. a??Ita??s bad if we want to know whata??s going on outside ourselves.a?? a??Dona??t we have eyes and ears for that?a?? She nodded. a??Theya??re okay most of the time. But sometimes they just get in the way. The earth is speaking to us, but we cana??t hear because of all the racket our senses are making. Sometimes we need to erase them, erase our senses. Then - maybe - the earth will touch us. The universe will speak. The stars will whisper."" ""She was gone. She was serenity. Her lips faintly smiling. Her golden skin. The glowing thread-ends of her hair. She seemed to have been dipped in sunlight and set here to dry. I felt a pang of jealousy, that she could be sitting next to me and not know it. That she could be somewhere and I could not be there, too.""",Julie Rimpula
9780440416777,"Stargirl Caraway is an enigma. She's the type of girl that you either love or hate--with no room for any emotions in between. When she first comes to the high-school as a sophomore in small town Mica, Arizona, her name reverberates throughout the hallways. What kind of a name is Stargirl? Was she really home-schooled for all these years, or did she just magically appear in Mica? How can she seem so calm, so serene, why eating quietly alone in the lunchroom, then strumming her ukulele as if all alone? The boys in school are immediately struck by her quiet, unassuming beauty. The girls are both jealous of her innate naturalness and excited to have her enthusiasm in the school. For Leo Borlock, it's a mixture of fear and excitement that has him falling in love with the mysterious Stargirl--and a desire to see her on the Hot Seat, the in-school television show he runs with his best friend, Kevin. The kids at school embrace Stargirl--her quirkiness, her individuality, her enthusiasm and exuberance for everything she does. She discovers friends and cheerleading, and she's popular. Popular, that is, until she starts rooting for the opposition, determined to bring joy and happiness to everyone, not just her home team. Suddenly, she's not the popular girl that everyone wants to be around. The same individuality that was once embraced is now snubbed, literally, by almost everyone in school. Except for Leo, who's in love with the enigmatic Stargirl, a girl who whole-heartedly loves him back. Until Leo is forced to choose between the affections of an entire school full of classmates and the maybe-too-individual Stargirl. When faced with the choice of one person versus many, Leo might not be strong enough to make the right decision. Jerry Spinelli has penned a book that goes straight to the heart of wanting to fit in, of sometimes being too good to believe, of life and love and heartbreak and the desire to be different, yet the same as everyone else. STARGIRL is a pure delight, and you won't be able to help being drawn into this very believable story, and it's truly unbelievable characters. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

It has a great story with amazing unforgettable characters that you will feel sorry for and wish you were more like, especially stargirl. she is so ..daring! she does things you wish you could do and makes you want to go out into the world and just not care about what people think about you as long as you're happy and you try to make others happy too.",T.V and Book Addict
9780805099232,"Princess Lia is to marry a prince of a neighboring country. The night before their wedding, she flees with her handmaiden to a small town by the sea where she becomes a barmaid. All she wants is a simple life, but little does she know two men are after her. One is her betrothed prince and the other an assassin. What she finds is a budding romance with a man whom she believes is a farm hand. A lovely story about a strong-headed princess who has a very real and modern personality set in a world where countries are at war, and assassins run amok. The pacing was pretty slow in the beginning.. Nothing really happens except a lot of character development between the entire cast, but I didn't necessarily mind it this time. The plot finally moves forward after the middle and I was surprised at how big the world was. As for the characters, I truly enjoyed Lia. She was super head strong and never let anyone else sway her opinions at all. I rather liked her a lot. Even though there is instant romance, it wasn't as sudden as it is in most books. It was rather a whirlwind romance though. And as for the love interests, I liked him too. Though for the entire beginning I thought the one she liked was the other so that confused me so. Luckily I finally came to my senses and got the characters right. There were some pretty cute lines when they start falling in love. I wanted more adventure and fantasy.. Though I'm hoping the next book will have both. Overall, if you're looking for an adventure filled journey, you won't find it until the end. But if you're in it for romance, pick this one up.",Giselle SM
9780805099232,"I received a copy of this book via the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This did not affect the outcome of my opinion in any way. Before I read The Kiss of Deception, I didna??t realize the author was Mary Pearson, who also wrote The Adoration of Jenna Fox. I didna??t know much about the book when I requested it on Netgalley, just that I loved the cover and it was fantasy. It sounded like something I could definitely enjoy. After I downloaded it, I began to hear all the lovely reviews come in about just how awesome it was. And of course I thought, good instincts Jess. And then EVERYONE started talking about it and finally I was like I have to have to read this book. And I ended up winning a copy a?? the day it showed up I started reading it (about 6 pm). By 1 am I had finished the entire thing. It was that good. Now, I have to say first of all that this book was very well written and planned out. Therea??s a lot of detail and the world was painted with words really well. I could see what it was supposed to look like and that really helped shape the story for me. Also, there was a map! As you may know, I feel very strongly about fantasy books having a well-drawn map for me to see what is going on. And I even won the map in poster size, so I could stare at it as our characters traveled across this land. I loved Lia. She was strong and brave a?? deciding to take her own fate in her hands. She was sworn to another countrya??s prince and of course doesna??t want to marry someone she hasna??t met. While some would say her move is selfish, I think it was brave. Her whole life she was treated like a bargaining chip and she would rather live as a peasant than be married off and sent to a foreign land. Her lovely hand maiden Pauline decides to leave everything to follow the princess. To me, Pauline was even more brave, because she left her entire life and safety to protect Lia without even questioning it. The background characters the entire way through were rich and complex and I really appreciated that. The book is basically two parts a?? the first part is the weaker of the two, but I was still compelled to read. However, the second part was just magical. I couldna??t stop reading it and I loved every moment. There is an annoying part of the book that was actually quite brilliant on the part of the author. When Lia runs, she is followed by two people: an assassin sent from a foreign land to kill her and the prince she was supposed to marry. The assassin expects his job to be quick and the prince just wants to see this girl who had the courage to do what he had not. Of course, they both find her despite the great lengths she went to to shirk anyone following her and end up in the pub she works for at the same time. Rafe and Kaden then become named Rafe and Kaden while Lia is our narrator. However, they remain named The Assassin and The Prince when they are the narrator. And so, we are tossed and tumbled about wondering which boy is which. Of course, both boys end up falling for her. While she likes both, there is clearly one she is attracted to more. And it isna??t until the second half of the book that we find out which is which. I will say that even though it is two boys, it isna??t much of a love triangle (thank goodness!) However, the tension was definitely there. And this my friends is MADDENING. Seriously, I was making myself crazy trying to figure it out. Ita??s really what drove me through the first part of the book, because I had to know. I HAD to. And then once I did, things completely changed and the book shifted into something new and the compulsion to keep reading came from it just being an awesome story. There is also a bit of magic with this book. As the first daughter, Lia has powers that have just begun to wake up. With the help of a character she meets in the second half, she begins to wake up that power and put it to good use. It was almost as if we can see the magical aspects of the book coming. There is a lot of lore and ancient text that we will probably see as the series comes to fruition. The pieces Pearson gave us were enough to hook me. With a beautiful cover and even more beautiful words, this book had me. Add to it a rich story and a wonderful set up for the next book and Ia??m totally on board this new fantasy series. Now it just needs to be 2015 so I can find out what happens next! This review was originally featured on Such a Novel Idea.",Jess @ Such a Novel Idea
9780857079978,"This book had been on my TBR for a very long time. Unwind was one of those poor books that I put off reading because I just cannot even imagine that it could be as good as everyone makes it seem. I mean, a book where people get unwound? What did that even mean?! But let me tell you, it really really is. It was riveting, it was adrenaline, it was anger and happiness. It was the closest thing to perfection that Ia??ve read in a very long time. Neal Shusterman writes brilliantly and his storytelling is fantastic. He leaves things up to the imagination and doesna??t spoon-feed information. What is a??storkinga??? What are a??clappersa??? Youa??ll just have to wait and see. At no point are you info-dumped, you just have to find the nuggets of information as you read. One minute I was like a??whoa thata??s deepa??, and the next I was laughing. The way so many murky topics are discussed are so interesting as well. Abortion. Religion. Organ donation. Parenting. Nothing is black and nothing is white. Morally grey characters and topics are some of my all-time favourite things, and the way the story played with that was spectacular. Unwind is told in multiple POVs (mostly through the eyes of Connor, Risa and Lev; the three main characters), and each character has their own distinct voice. At no point did I get lost and have to go back to remind myself of who was talking. That doesna??t happen often. The character development for all three main characters was fantastic. They were all well-rounded and easy to relate to, and the way they grew throughout the story was A++. All of the secondary characters were fleshed out really well too. AND THE PLOT! The pacing is pretty much perfection. It was like a snowball, starting off the size of your palm and then finishing as big as a house. The last quarter or so of the book was INTENSE. I.N.T.E.N.S.E. Now I just need to get my hands on Unwholly.",TheBookHangover
9780007444113,"YOU CAN SEE THIS REVIEW AND MORE LIKE IT AT: http://the-fiction-faerie.blogspot.com.au/ Heres my take on it. I just finished it about a half hour ago. This wasn't the best book Ive ever read. For me, it seemed to lack that climactic feeling that I look forward to in the ending of a series or trilogy. But I still really enjoyed this book and thought it was an appropriate ending to the story. I usually finish books in a few hours. I zipped right through Divergent and Insurgent when each of those came out. But Allegiant took me a few days to read, because I just could not get into the story. It was boring, slow-paced, and lacked the action of the previous books. The dual POV (point of view) made matters worse because I'd often forget if I was in Tris' or Tobias' POV, and I had to go back multiple times to check. I'm curious, did anyone actually like the dual POV? I understand why it was necessary, but it wasn't effective at all. Their internal voices were identical. The plot itself was where I took the most offense though. It was cliched, convoluted, tried too hard to address every single loose thread while just creating many more, and it ultimately never reached any sort of exciting climax. Like others have said, I struggled to feel invested in this story (unlike the prior two novels, which I couldn't put down!) and felt like I was always waiting for something exciting to happen, which ultimately never came. Overall this wasn't the worst YA fiction book out but it could have been better. Way better. It wasn't predictable like I had thought it would be but not necessary in a good way.",Rachel Nichols
9780857073631,"Highly recommended for those who likes a dose of mystery and horror. This book is hauntingly beautiful. Great job Michelle Hodkin on your debut novel. I have always craved for such books but can't seem to find one that really meets my expectations. There are close ones. I found my love for such books after reading the first book of the Pretty Little Liars series by Sara Shepard and can't seem to find close substitutes to it. I'm so glad that I read this book and it ended with a cliffhanger. Gaaah, I can;t get enough of this book. The characters are wonderful especially Mara and Noel. The events are really haunting and I'm in love with Michelle's writing. Its fits so perfectly with the plot. There were times where I was a confused as Mara, great job on that.

9780857073631,"(I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.) 16-year-old 'Mara' (that's not her real name, but the name she's using), has recently survived an accident that killed her 2 friends and her boyfriend. Her parents tell her that she was in an abandoned asylum, and that the building collapsed on top of them, but Mara doesn't remember anything. Convinced that what she needs is a fresh start somewhere else, Mara and her family move to Florida, and Mara enrols at a private school, where she makes friends with a boy called Jamie, and catches the attention of the beautiful and British Noah. Things aren't going well for Mara though. She's been told that she's suffering from post-traumatic stress, but she's not sure if that covers the things that are happening to her - seeing her dead friends faces when she looks in a mirror, hallucinating things that aren't really there, and now, seeing people's deaths before they happen. But is she just nuts, or is something else going on? I have to say that I'm a bit confused over this book! Poor Mara is hallucinating, she's delusional, and at times it's very difficult to know what is real, and what is imagined! I did enjoy the book, and I did like the storyline, although I thought that it fell a little flat in places. I just found it quite difficult to work out what was real and what was a hallucination! I liked Mara, as messed up as she was, and I liked Noah, although I felt there could have been a touch more romance in the story. Even having finished the book there are certain things that are a mystery still, and I'm really not sure how to take the ending! It will certainly be interesting to find out what happens next! 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780545424943,"The first thing I did after finishing The Raven Boys? I made a trip to the nearest bookstore to pick up The Dream Thieves, of course! The Raven Cycle is a very special series, one that I'm still kicking myself for waiting so long to read. And importantly, The Dream Thieves lived up to my (very high) expectations for a sequel to that fantastic read. Reasons to Read: 1. A seamless sequel: The Dream Thieves is a great example of a perfect transition from the first book to its sequel. The transition here was so fluid, it truly felt like a continuation of the same story. The Raven Boys was a very strong start to a series and The Dream Thieves simply builds on that foundation. The plot, world, and the characters are further developed and as a result, the reader is completely immersed in the story. 2. Particular attention is paid to Ronan: Ronan Lynch was introduced as one of the Raven Boys in the first book, but he was more of a background character. The Dream Thieves pays a significant amount of attention to both Ronan's back story and his present struggles. I appreciated the fact that characters aside from Blue and Gansey are given the attention they deserve and treated like people rather than plot devices and Ronan is a perfect example of this in The Dream Thieves. 3. One of the most romantic scenes ever: Romance isn't a must-have for me in a book, but I appreciate a great love story as much as any other reader! The love story in The Raven Cycle hasn't been at all what I expected prior to starting the series, but I'm so pleased with it. For readers who love gradual, swoon-worthy love stories with ever-mounting tension The Dream Thieves captures this story flawlessly. Admittedly, there were a couple subplots which I had a harder time trying to fit into the overall story (such as The Gray Man and Kavinsky) which felt somewhat out of place and forced compared to the remainder of the book. That being said, this was fairly minor for me and didn't detract from my overall reading experience. I love the magic in this series, and I was absolutely blown away by how great of a sequel The Dream Thieves is compared to The Raven Boys as an introduction to The Raven Cycle. Maggie Stiefvater's writing is magical in and of itself, but the world she created here is incredibly intoxicating! Hardcover personally purchased.",Brenna Staats
9780545424943,"Favourite Quote: ""What do you want, Adam?"" To feel awake when my eyes are open. The first book in this series was just okay for me, so I was skeptical about this book. Even though I'm giving this book the same rating as the first, I actually enjoyed this book more! I give this book 3/5 stars! The plot was easier to follow than the first books, so I was grateful for that. There were many sub-plots interwoven with the main plot and I think they fitted well together and made the book more interesting and developed! The ending was on a bit of a cliffhanger but not one that I can't wait to get my hands on the next book but still I'm looking forward to the next book! The characters are the thing I love most about this book! Ronan, Ronan, Ronan, so much love for Ronan! He was my favourite in the first book and still remains mine in after this one! There was a personal secret revealed about Ronan near the end and I actually never saw it coming! But it just made me love him more! Then there's the other character, Blue who actually was not in a lot of the book, but she was okay. Gansey is next and I love him too, though him and Blue are too cliche for my liking! Adam and Noah were okay for me, Adam had some character development but I still don't feel that connected to him. Then there was the introduction of the Grey Man who was as dull as the colour grey and boring! Overall this was better than the first but still just okay! Hopefully the next book is even better!",brookexx
9780545424943,"Maggie Stiefvater is a genius. The Dream Thieves, to put it simply, BLEW MY MIND! I loved The Raven Boys, but at that time, I didn't fully appreciate the sheer brilliance of Steifvater's writing. I wanted to be thrown into the action right away, but she takes her time and slowly lets us into the lives of each of her characters. The time she took to develop the characters in The Raven Boys allowed for a seamless transition into book two. This is part of what made The Dream Thieves that much more incredible. Sometimes when I read a sequel, it takes me a while to remember what had happened in the first book. Steifvater writes in such a way that, as soon as I finished chapter one, I felt like I was reading the books back to back. This is an extremely rare occurance which truly showcases just how deep her character development is. Since I felt as though the first third of The Raven Boys was spent on character building, when I started The Dream Thieves, I felt as if I were visiting old friends whom I had dearly missed. The prologue to The Dream Thieves is one of the most meaningful, engaging, and honest prologues I have ever read. It sucked me right in, and I just knew I would be in for one hell of a journey. This is where I talk about the writing. Maggie Steifvater's writing has this unique and magical quality to it unlike ANY author I have ever read. Her writing is so captivating and real. Her sentences do not just tell the story, but each one is a piece of art all on its own. While reading The Dream Thieves, there were countless times where I would read a sentence, and go right back and read it again. Now, this was not because I didn't understand said sentence, but because Steifvater's way with words had me in such awe of her talent. There is soo much depth and meaning behind every line in this book. It was truly mesmerizing. The characters are some of my favorite in all of YA fiction. I love how broken they are. Each one has their own demons to battle. They are nowhere near perfect, but that's what makes them soo relatable. The Aglionby boys and Blue feel like dear friends to me, and I am planning on re-reading The Dream Thieves soon just to feel their presence again. We are introduced to some new characters, and the mysterious Gray Man is one of my favorites. I feel like he was written so perfectly because he could have quite easily become a hated character. It is only through Stefvater's writing that he is understood, and thus we are given the ability to connect with him on a human level. I would say that The Dream Thieves could be considered Ronan's book. One reason is because he experiences such emotional highs and lows thoughout the novel which cause him to change as a person. Another reason is that much of the plot is based upon his secrets; his newfound ability to manifest(or steal) objects from his dreams, and a few other big game changers. That being said, every other main character is given the perfect amount of ""screen time"". I felt that this was the natural progression of the story, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. The pacing is perfect and that is all I will say on that. Is there romance? Well if you have read the first book, you know it's not so easy as ""romance? or not?"". I guess you will just have to read the book and see what happens... All in all, this was my favorite Maggie Steifvater book that I have read so far. Screw it!...This is the best book I have read in 2013 so far. Everything was pitch-perfect. My only complaint would be that the book ended at page 438, because I never wanted to stop reading. When I finally turned that last page, I literally hugged the book to my chest for like 15 minutes, just thinking. At that moment, I realized that I had not just finished a book, but I had experienced something tryly profound. I had fully realized how amazingly talented Maggie Steifvater is. I have read almost everything she had ever written, and to me, she just keeps getting better and better with every book! I never re-read books, no, not a single one! I could re-read this book over and over again and find something new every single time. There is just that much depth and meaning behind each beautiful word. I am soo incredibly happy to know there are two more books still to come in the series! Everyone should read this! I mean EVERYONE! If your a fan of The Raven Boys, then I know you must be dying to read The Dream Thieves. If you haven't started the series yet, then I highly recommend you do so. Fans of every genre will find something here, and I guarentee you will come back for more Maggie Steifvater!",Jessica @ Jessabella Reads
9780141335278,"My review: This is the long-awaited conclusion to the Beautiful Creatures saga. And, honestly, it was my least favorite of the entire series. I had huge hopes for the book and, while I did enjoy it, I didn't love it as much as I would have expected or liked. The story was told from the switching POVs of Lena and Ethan, as they were apart for much of the book. While I didn't mind the back and forth (it was a necessary thing), I thought that the story dragged a bit during the time during which they essentially had separate lives. Unfortunately, at times it was difficult to really understand how much time was even passing in the story. I loved Ethan in this story, with his dedication and loyalty. I had a hard time pinning Lena down in this book, however. Sometimes she seemed powerful, the world's strongest Caster. Other times, she seemed a bit weak and ""damsely."" I came away from this series almost feeling as if her entire being was dependent upon Ethan's presence in order to have a life and a personality. All of that being said, I did enjoy the new twists and turns and the deep seated need to know how it would end for them kept me turning the pages! Things to love about Beautiful Redemption... --The ending. I liked how it ended and I liked the underlying message of love and loyalty. --The mythology. The mythology of the Caster world was pretty fascinating and we got a lot of it in this book. Things I wanted more of... --Ethan and Lena together. My recommendation: If you have read the other books in the series, this is a must-read to close out this wonderful series! My rating: A 3.5 mugs.",Kim
9781416975908,"March 19th was an epic date for every Shadowhunter fan. With the release of CLOCKWORK PRINCESS we got a first class ticket back to one of our most beloved set of 19th century Shadowhunter darlings. At the end of CLOCKWORK PRINCE many things were left unsolved. What is Tessa's heritage? What's it about her mysterious Clockwork Angel and who will get the girl in the end? The main focus of THE INFERNAL DEVICES is on the clockwork creatures that have been invading the Shadowhunters' peace for quite some time now. A werewolf here, a faerie there, but their presence is not as remarkable as in Cassandra's THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS series. A great part of the story is about the relationships of the Shadowhunters and their friends and the power struggles of the Clave. Its relationships are as nifty and delicate as in a Jane Austen novel, its battle scenes and imaginative storyline uniquely Cassandra Clare. Will and Jem are truly a gift. This book is Cassandra Clare's best so far, also her hardest and most sincere. Big parts of it are about facing death and what it means to lose the people you truly love so much, you simple can not bear to be without them. Jem and Will are friends and the best Team! In CLOCKWORK PRINCESS Cassandra Clare explores the possibilities of two great loves in one life and the endless boundaries of a true friendship. Friends, almost like brothers, don't necessarily need to become enemies because they are in love with the same girl. And said girl doesn't always have to be the pressured one. Tessa is very strong and headstrong and luckily has the capacities to decide on her own. Unsurprisingly, CLOCKWORK PRINCESS continued the love triangle between Tessa, Jem and Will and acted on its threats to cause heartbreak for everyone involved, regardless of whether you are rooting for one or the other boy. There's much time to untangle personal relationships and issues of all kinds. Each couple is different in its own wonderful way and it was a pleasure to get to know them better individually and as a pair. Gabriel, Gideon, Cecily, Will, Jem, Tessa, Charlotte, Henry, Sophie, Magnus. Cassandra Clare found fluent passages from one chapter, one story, to the next and everything's very consistent. I was so thankful for the last hundred pages of this book. Cassandra Clare didn't end the fight and with it the story. She gave us and her characters time to say goodbye. Mellow and intimate. Words I needed to read, secrets I wanted to know. Overall a well-rounded trilogy. The ending had a very Downton Abbey Christmas special feel about it and it made me feel so increibly good about the characters and the story and everything at that moment. Some things, I knew, were inevitable. Yet reading about them, broke my heart, every single word equaling a teary sob. I hadn't expected that to happen and it got even worse towards the epilogue. The epilogue. You might have heard about it by now. The epilogue is everything all at once. How can you have a happy ending and at the same time you are only partly happy about it? And I just couldn't resist to compose a little song for my favourite Shadowhunter: Shadowhunters break my heart, with their sweetness, kindred souls, off to bake a duckling tarte, for my sweet sweet Will. 5/5 ***** CLOCKWORK PRINCESS - YA dreams come to fulfilment. Brilliant and all-consuming! I can wholeheartedly say, this is one of my favourite series, even among the favourites! Reading CLOCKWORK PRINCESS was just marvelous! Cassandra Clare has found a writing voice that draws you into her stories like no other. CLOCKWORK PRINESS is her best book so far, making the THE INFERNAL DEVICES series so incredibly hard not to adore.",MissPageTurner
9781416975908,"For anyone who loved the mortal instruments series, this series does as it promises and delivers the same excitement as the first. I found myself in tears by the end of the series, as the author does a spectacular job as capturing the lives of the characters and drawing the reader into their struggles and triumphs. I am very sad that there are only three books to the series, however, those three are jam-packed with adventure, mystery, passion and romance and do not disappoint whatsoever. This book in particular concludes the series nicely, tying up loose ends and leaving the reader imagining the stories of the characters in their lives to follow.",Tessa

9781444766882,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I watched the TV series which just got better and better so when I saw the book I just had to get my hands on it. So, I then thought the trick to reading this book is to forget about the TV series and read the book as if I have never heard of the story. A better plan because there appeared so many differences in the book which you cana??t help but compare whilst reading. Start againa?|.. What was the book about in a nutshell. 100 young adult criminals under 18 were sent back to earth to see it was habitable again after nuclear contamination. The different areas they came from onboard meant that there was already a class hierarchy. Faintly reminiscence of Lord of Flies, ensued with such unruly reprobates. Most of the book was learning about the main protagonists; their crime, circumstances, and friends. The bits I liked about the book? I love this genre so much, and enjoyed the background setting that Morgan painted in a way that so plausible. (Or was I thinking about what I had watched on TV?) I liked the characters with a great mix of emotional confusion with Wells and Clarke/Bellamy, typical YA behaviour told with each POV. I enjoyed how the characters remained so plausible, with young adults complete with their inexperiences and angsts trying to be responsible though a rage of hormones. Morgan also gets the moral thoughts racing; No, how could they do that! Were their deaths necessary? But what if they didna??t a?? how do you choose? Who are the real criminals here? So much to question after you put the book down. I liked the hierarchy of the classes having an impact on their perception of each other, especially the way life became expendable for the greater good the lower class you were. Nicely done. What didna??t work for me? I didna??t like the way the POV was told in a block of flashback in each of the characters chapter. It felt very disjointed and almost like the real story was the flashback parts, and the current-day was a fill-in waiting for things to get more excitingly active towards the end. I would have preferred for the story to have started with everyones story, the excitement building slowly towards being back on earth when their fearful adventure begins. Had I not seen this fantastically imaginative story on TV I probably would have felt it to be a very slow book that cheated me out of the excitement I craved and possibly would have given up reading half way through. I believe I filled out gaps with my imagination from watching it earlier. Overall, ita??s an okay book but lacks any true excitement or goal. I understand this book was written after the series a?? sorry just didna??t work! (Thanks to the publisher via NetGalley for a copy of this book for my honest review).",Gillian Haygreen
9781444766882,"The book is set in the future the earth become a place that was unable to sustain human life so the last humans fearing that they would all die made a plan to get onto a ship and live in space, but years of living on a ship in space is not easy and life is harsh. Kids and teens imprisoned for small crimes only to be kill as soon as they turn 18 but something has changed and the council decide that 100 young criminals will be given the change at freedom with sounds great, but not when that freedom means being shipped of to earth where no one knows if the planet is even safe. So I watched the TV program with no clue that it was based on a book to start with, but I'm really glad I was given the chance to review the book. I loved the whole storyline the harsh reality of what life is like in space because earth is not able to sustain life. The way the law is so finally and frightening how simple things that you would think nothing of are punishable by death or imprisonment until you 18 years old I felt resentment for the council and found myself sucked into the lives of these teens and what they go through. How some simple human rights to me are governed by laws and freewill seemed more like a luxury that most don't have on the ship. Once the 100 get to earth and away from the restrictions of the ship I had hoped that things would be simpler, but in a harsh place with limited resources and well 100 teens that are deemed criminals whether it being a small crime or a large one life becomes all about adapting and learning to live in a place that's very alien to them all. I felt for the people I followed through the course of the book I feared for them when things are hard and smiled and laughed when the discovered new things they never had on the ship. The 100 have complete freewill with no rules or structure no adults to yell at them or anything, but while some seem to do the right things and want to look after the group other seem to just want to be jerks and start fights and throw there weight about.I found the whole book was very engrossing and easy to read I was excited for every chapter for all the new information and back history of the characters and why they are at this point. It was a simple brilliant read from start to finish and I found no faults or little things that I disliked the whole book felt like it was made for me. I happily give this book five stars and would recommend to others in a heart beat",annmarie ager

This was an enjoyable sci-fi story, and there were lots of individual stories going on within the main storyline. I liked the characters in this, and it was interesting the way the story followed so many characters, and each characters individual problems all fitted into the main storyline. Each character had their own problems and agendaa??s though, and it was clear how things could become difficult when all these agendaa??s didna??t mesh! The storyline itself took place over quite a short period of time, so it felt like we got lots of beginnings of individual storylines, but not a lot else.

9780142420898,"Once again, Forman creates a beautiful emotional story, capturing those painfully honest moments of her two main characters. I really enjoyed how this book?C/??s POVs, as the reader gets to understand Adam much better. If this story had stayed in Mia?C/??s perspective, it would have once again been a story about the grief and loss of her family. By placing the story three years after the last book and writing it from Adam?C/??s POV, the characters can open up and begin to heal. As a reader, you?C/??re totally inside Adam?C/??s head. You feel what he feels. You understand how fully broken he has become. He?C/??s a shell of a person, full of pain and resentment toward Mia. The bitterness is done so well that the reader can?C/??t help but start to resent Mia too. The music, once again, brings such life to the story and really makes it stand out against other YA contemporaries . Expect in this book, I think that the incorporation of the music is done even better. The chapter?C/??s begin with Adam?C/??s song lyrics, which are all about Mia. The torment, bitterness, resentment, and overall grief he bleeds into each songs is so powerful, almost becoming a character of its own. The ending of the story is beautifully pulled together, creating a satisfying and realistic resolution for these two characters. Like If I Stay, it?C/??s an easy read that the reader can fly through. There?C/??s nothing too complex about the writing or the word choice, but the story is still profound, leaving the reader thinking long after finishing the book. Mia and Adam?C/??s story is definitely one of my favorite YA contemporary stories. You should definitely check this book out, as well as If I Stay. Neither books will disappoint.",Ryann Dannelly
9780142420898,"WHERE SHE WENT is different from IF I STAY in a way that reading it didna??t feel like a punch in the gut. It was more like a steady dull ache in my chest that lingered all throughout the book. It wasna??t a sudden head-on collision with grief the way the first book had been. It was a methodical pain a?? constant and always present. Every page reeked of sadness thata??s almost unbearable. Therea??s just so much regret, guilt, anger and loneliness in this book. Honestly, I almost put it down after skimming the first few pages and discovered that Adam and Mia werena??t together anymore. And boy, am I ever glad that I picked it up again and braved it to the end. I liked that the sequel was told from Adama??s perspective. It showed him in a different light. And I think ita??s only appropriate that the story was told from the point of view of the one who was left behind. It opened a lot of hanging questions, especially that there had been no closure between Adam and Mia. I was hanging on to every page, hoping and dreading the moment when they would eventually meet again. All the angst and bitterness made me want to curl up and cry, but this book is just too good to put down. I enjoyed the flashbacks of their past together. I learned more about how Adama??s relationship with Miaa??s family had been, and how their deaths affected him. When I read IF I STAY, it didna??t occur to me that even though theya??re not Adama??s family, he lost them, too. He was also grieving but managed to still take care of Mia. WHERE SHE WENT cemented my belief that Adama??s love for Mia was so deep that it also extended to her family. I was also amazed by the fact that Miaa??s leaving made Adam write a lot of songs. The lyrics were especially beautiful. Sad, yes, but beautiful. Gayle Forman did not disappoint with this worthy sequel of IF I STAY. To say that I loved WHERE SHE WENT would be an understatement. It moved me to witness a love so deep that it could change a persona??s life. Adama??s love for Mia changed his life and left him broken when she left. And in the end, this same love brought them where they need to be a?? together.",Julie Rimpula
9780439023511,"I am in shock. I have finally reached the end of a series that I never thought I would read. This third and final book in the saga is easily the most violent, the most emotional, and the most fast-paced of the bunch. There were twists and turns that I never saw coming, and I can say as others have that the book ended the way it needed to. I know some have complained about the ending, but I felt as though I had closure after finishing the epilogue. This entire series is something that everyone is talking about, and I do not want to give away anything. I would say that the author has given each character their proper voice and told a tale that will give one pause to think about the future. Could it happen? I do not know, but I can hope and pray this book is not prophetic. All I can say is it is not improbable. One of the sweetest points in the whole series was that of Buttercup, the cat. I was quite touched with this part of the story though it was a small s,ene. If you have not read this series, I can recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone over the age of 12.",Ruth Hill
9780439023511,"Originally reviewed on my blog: http://sikbookreviews.blogspot.ca Mockingjay is the final book in The Hunger Games trilogy. It is now time for District 13 to really make themselves known to the world and to the Capitol. With the help of their mockingjay (Katniss), the people of District 13 intend to take down the Capitol and change the world as they know it. Gale is also there to help with the uprising alongside Katniss, but Peeta is not able to help for reasons that will become clear when you read the book. You will absolutely hate the Capitol more than ever in this book, but will you like District 13 any better? It begins to become clear that the government and president of District 13 might not be much better than that of the Capitol. The book is filled with action, shocking twists and turns, and will make you want to kill the Capitol yourself! I gave Mockingjay a rating of 3 because I was, surprisingly, very disappointed with it. I absolutely LOVED the first two books of this trilogy, but this one was extremely disappointing. In the previous books, Katniss was always right in the middle of the action and kicking butt. But, in this book, it seemed as though Katniss was always messed up and in the hospital instead of helping the battle towards the Capitol. She is involved in some action, of course, but not at the more important times. Collins also did not show some of the action that the reader is anticipating, such as the rescue of Peeta or a lot of the actual destruction of the Capitol. I was also EXTREMELY disappointed with the ending. What is the point in reading two fantastic books and then ending the third one in such a disappointing fashion? In my opinion, the last book should be the best book, otherwise you are just left with an incomplete, depressing feeling...or is that just me? The ending of this book felt very rushed. It did not seem complete. It did not describe as much as it should have in order to give a complete feeling. I'm not sure what was happening with Collins during this ending, since she has demonstrated her wonderful writing skills in the first two books. Maybe it was the pressure of a deadline. Maybe because the first two were so successful, she felt the need to rush through this one to satisfy fans? However, rushing through the writing will not satisfy fans!!! I still suggest that you read the trilogy, as the first two are well worth reading. Just don't get your hopes up for a thrilling, satisfying completion.",Sam
9780439023511,"Mockingjay continues right after the events of Catching Fire and does not reduce the suspense level for a single second. Katniss and Peeta are separated, she is in District 13 with the rebels, Peeta is with the opponents. Due to their separation and the horrible consequences connected to it, Mockingjay is different to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Where the first two novels take their time to focus on the exceptional love between Peeta and Katniss, Mockingjay is mostly about war. Where the previous battles were concentrated on a small area and left room for love, Mockingjay has almost no time to feature it, which shows the extensions and seriousness of this very last war. The fight against the capitol is determining, absolute and decides about life or death of everyone. I would have loved to read more about the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and the love triangle with Gale, but I can really understand the legitimate lack of love in times of war. Collins invented an authentic storyline, with characters you would be glad to call your friends, and characters you would fear to call your enemies with a bet and a goal that couldn't be more absolute. Characters like Katniss, Peeta and Gale grow to their fullest possibilities, experience their worst nightmares and need to make decisions that can change their lives and the future of the whole country forever. Collins' writing style is as qualitative as before, but something in her arrangement of the story and actions changed. She applies a faster pace and doesn't give as many details or time to adjust to shocking incidents and unexpected turns. Her writing and pace strengthen the feeling of witnessing a terrible war. In war there is no time for love, no time for details, sometimes not even time for life itself. Mockingjay has a very abrupt ending, so that I really appreciated the short glimpse into Panem's future, that gives us a hint of how life goes on after the incidents of Mockingjay. In the end some would say Katniss' sacrifice was worthless, but an act of compassion and courage, the one second you stand up against a totalitarian system is always worth the movement! In conclusion I must say that this novel should be two. Mockingjay captures so many characters, actions and feelings that I was sometimes just overwhelmed by their brutality and vastness. Another reason is of course, that I already miss (almost) every single character of The Hunger Games series. Real or not real? The story might be fictional, but the effects it has on my literary life are true. I'm in love with The Hunger Games series! THE VERDICT I give it 4,5/5 stars. A former game has become reality. How can you survive when the whole world has become the arena of a deadly war? Mockingjay is the utterly sad and touching final instalment of The Hunger Games. If you loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, you shouldn't hesitate to pick up this novel, it will stagger you!",MissPageTurner
9780439023511,"I literally just finished this book. And honestly...I'm practically speechless. I normally keep a little notebook with me while I read a book I'm going to review and I write down random points that I want to make in my reviews. Then, when I'm ready to write the review, I get my notebook, and I start to write about the different points I had picked. Things I liked and disliked about the book, or quotes that really stood out to me. When I finished Mockingjay, I started to go downstairs to retrieve my notebook from where I left it the night before. And then I stopped. I turned around and headed straight for my computer. I didn't even need the notebook. After turning that last page, everything I felt about the book was in my head and weighing on my heart. I didn't need a piece of paper to tell me how I felt about the last book in The Hunger Games Trilogy. This book...Oh gosh. This book caught my attention and held it just as the previous two had. But with it being the third, I was even more eager to read faster and to learn and to see how these characters and the world around them was going to end up. There were moments in this book where I was giggling to myself, blinking rapidly because I could feel the sting of tears coming on, or cursing out loud because I was so angry with a situation that occuring or because a character had truly pissed me off. But don't get me wrong. That I was feeling such anger and frustration was not a bad thing. In reverse, it was very good. Because it was not the writing or the author that pissed me off, it was the story and the situation because I was so deeply involved in it that I felt like I was a part of it. Not many books can get that big of a reaction out of me. I stayed up late reading this book, I disappeared into my bedroom in solitary confinement for hours, and when I wasn't reading Mockingjay, I was dying to get back to it. By the time I finished, I walked into the kitchen, laid the book on the table, and with a pouting face and teary eyes, I told my husband to go finish reading it. The Hunger Games will forever be a trilogy that I will come back to. When I finish a series, I judge how great it was by my reaction when I finish the words on the very last page and sit the book down. If I'm still thinking about it thirty minutes to an hour later, wishing it didn't end, then it was amazing. Harry Potter was the only series that has made me feel this way. Until I finished The Hunger Games. This series will forever be on of my all time favorites and I cannot wait to delve right back in to Panem.",Rainy Days and Pajamas
9780439023511,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Oh. My. God. I don't even know what to say about this book. I'm very heart-broken that this series has ended. I tried to read it slow, to savor every last detail of the book, but it was just too good and I had to devour it! Even though a lot has changed and it wasn't as good as The Hunger Games (Of course!) it was amazing! I finished it hours ago and I can't stop thinking about it, and I doubt I will for a while. Each book has continued to haunt me. Katniss has grown so much since volunteering to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games. She's been forced to grow up. She never gets a break! Just when it seems like she can try and calm down a bit and just try and face the nightmares she already has to deal with, something else happens to bring on more nightmares. But she isn't the only one. A lot of other characters is thrown into the category as well. Namely Gale, Peeta, Prim, Finnick. I think this might of been the more emotional one out of the trilogy. But I can't completely set my mind on one because all of them set you on an emotional roller coaster ride. Just like the first two books, I was never able to guess at what would happen next. I could try and guess, but would always fail. I am very happy with the Epilogue, and I'm going to leave it at that because I don't want to give anything away. I canNOT wait for the freaking Hunger Games movie. I am counting down and hoping and praying they don't screw it up too much. Hopefully it will follow Harry Potters lead and be as close to the book they can get it! I recommend this to everyone. This series should definitely be on your to read list! It's worth every bit of the hype it is getting!",Amanda
9780439023511,"First of all, I have been DYING to read this book. It?s the final book of the trilogy and of course I needed to know how it would end. Before I started reading I had so many thoughts on my head like: 1. Please God, don?t let Katniss pick Gale over Peeta! 2. I don?t want Peeta to die!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3. You are not going to read the final pages to find out who Katniss ends up with! 4. I have to read those last few pages! 5. My reaction to the last pages: Well, I?m not going to tell you because it would pretty much tell you who she picks xD Ok, now to the actual review. I can?t believe this trilogy has come to end. I already miss the characters =/ If I had to rate the first two books, I would probably give The Hunger Games a 4.5 and a well deserved 5 to Catching Fire?rating Mockingjay, well not that easy. Mockingjay is definitely the darkest and most emotional book of all three; I was completely stunned and emotionally drained when I finished reading it. While the previous books focused mainly on the Hunger Games, this one focused on Katniss?s emotions. You can?t help but feel sorry for her and admire her for staying strong when there's so much going on around her and for dealing with all the responsibilities that lay now on her shoulders. Shes the Mockingjay, the symbol of freedom and hope during the war between the Capitol and District 13, and then of course there is Gale and Peeta. Katniss needs to sort out her feelings towards the boys, but that task becomes even more complicated because Peeta is a prisoner in the Capitol and endures constant torture to keep Katniss alive (what's not to love about Peeta). This book has it all: love, joy, hope but, mostly, sadness and pain. The characters were in the middle of war the entire time, after all. I knew I couldn?t expect a picture perfect ending and I love that Collins gives us realistic characters and endings. There is no happily ever after for anyone, but, still, I wasn?t prepared to read about all those tragic and heartbreaking deaths. Before this book was released, a lot of fans said that this one character was going to die and I thought, There's no way Suzanne Collins can kill that character!? Well, she did and it was so so sad! Still, I have to be honest and say that though the ending of Mockingjay was kind of rushed, the way Katniss ends up with the boy who I shall not name was..I don't know, weird maybe, it just happened all top quick and then there were some other characters who all of the sudden were MIA for no decent reason! Besides that, those last few pages were amazing. Reading Katniss's last thoughts made it all so much harder to say good bye to such an amazing story and all the characters. It's seriously impossible to ever forget this trilogy. I'm still mourning its end and the deaths as we speak. Overall, there are only two words to describe this trilogy: incredibly epic. My Rating: 4 (I would give it a five, but like I said before, there were some things about the ending that I didn't like very much. Honestly it didn't live up to my expectations.

I think this volume focused in on the main characters too soon, as I felt like I hadn't got a handle on the environment yet. The amusement park was hardly mentioned and none of the other inmates were involved in the story.

9781595141750,"It sometimes amazes me how authors are able to come up with such fantastic stories, and Richelle Mead is one of these authors! I absolutely loved Frostbite, probably more so than I did Vampire Academy. If you wanted to compare books, there is a lot less of Lissa in this novel, and a lot less intrigue throughout the first part of the novel. This is not a bad thing though. Sometimes, when reading the first book in a series, it's obvious it's a first book; it's setting up the plot for future stories, it introduces characters and mythology, it gives you enough to whet your appetite, but isn't exactly a complete story. Vampire Academy wasn't like that, it was it's own full story, and it was incredible, but after reading Frostbite, you can see how it could work like an obvious first story, as we know all of the above, and now we have, in Frostbite, what I would say is Rose's story. As I said, there was less intrigue; there was the worrying about Lissa's powers and whose was after her in the first novel, but in Frostbite, the danger isn't necessarily on anyone specific, it's just there. We focus a lot more on Rose's relationship with her mother, her feelings towards the guys in her life, Dimitri and Mason, and some issues with herself about whether she's changed or not. It's a brilliant insight into Rose, where as the first book was more focused on her wanting to protect Lissa. It was great to see more of this Rose, vulnerable Rose, and to see her grow. Yes, there is less Lissa as I said, but there is more of some other characters that we have come to love or hate, like: Christian, Mason and Mia. I can't really go into it without spoiling the story, but these three, along with Rose...you won't believe what you're reading, but it does make sense. Frostbite is quite a sad book, but it's amazing the strength people can show when things get really bad. I really was completely wowed. We meet some new characters, namely Janine- Rose's mum, Tasha- Christian's aunt, and Adrian, a royal moroi also holidaying in Idaho. Frostbite is quite a hard book to read emotionally, there's a lot more danger and more...reality of the world these characters live in, and it's not pretty. But it's such a fantastic read!",Sabrina

The news of the attack spread quickly and Christmas plans are done over and St. Vladimir's Academy filled with visiting Moroi families which also brings out Rose's mother to the school - happy reunion? I think not. With the Strigoi and her mother in town you'd think Rose wouldn't have time to remember the feelings she has for Dimitri, but those are there to stick, it doesn't matter that Mason, a fellow guardian novice is head over heels in love with her or that Christian's aunt Tasha has appeared to make her move on Dimitri - Rose still wants him and doesn't want to share. But knowing she cannot have him, regardless. We also get to meet Adrian, a Royal Moroi, who becomes interested in Rose and Lissa, interested in both but in different ways.

You get to ride the story out swiftly, the story picks up easy recapping the first book and then keeps moving one event after another, and most enjoyable, definitely, is the ski trip to a Moroi resort.

9781595141750,"For Rose Hathaway, life as a Guardian-in-training at St. Vladimir's Academy is never easy. While her best friend, future charge, and sole remaining member of the royal family member (Lissa) may no longer be in direct danger, the Strigoi (those vampires who drink blood, possess super-strength, have red pupils, and also have no qualms about using their powers over the elements as a method of attack) are still the greatest threat facing their Moroi counterparts. Rose and her number-one crush, instructor Dimitri Belakov, discover just how significant this threat is when they arrive at what should have been Rose's make-up Qualifier exam with famed Guardian Arthur Schoenberg. What they find instead is seven royal Moroi, massacred in their own home along with their Guardians - and evidence that the Strigoi are now being helped by humans. With Christmas vacation drawing near, St. Vlad's is on high alert and not terribly inclined to unleash their students into the great wide world. A school field trip to an exclusive Moroi ski lodge is the perfect solution, not just for a Moroi seeking to elude the Strigoi, but also for Rose, who's looking to escape two recent female campus arrivals - one of whom has a history and penchant for flirting with Dimitri. What guests from St. Vlad's and elsewhere will soon realize, though, is that their enemies are much closer than they think. FROSTBITE is an engrossing, complex paranormal follow-up to VAMPIRE ACADEMY, with a page-turning plot and deeply layered characters, whose growth and development over the course of the novel is believable and (in some cases) inevitable. Though there were a few scenes that lagged, I had a hard time putting this book down even for necessities like eating and sleeping.",TeensReadToo
9781595141750,"Frostbite is the second book in the amazing Vampire Academy series written by Richelle Mead. The first book was great but the second one is even better. Rose is 6 months away from her graduation; she'll be a full fledged guardian. She has to meet a very well known guardian for an evaluation, and since he can't leave the moroi he is protecting, Rose and Dimitri heads out to meet him. Only what they found wasn't what they expected. The entiere royal family and their guardians have all been slaughtered, evidences points in the direction of an alliance between strogois and humans. School is now on a high alert and many guardians comes in to protect the young ones, including Rose's mother. All school is brought on a mandatory ski trip and Rose meets Adrian who's disliked by all her friends due to his reputation. He isn't the one who will get them in trouble tho. Everything goes wrong when 3 students leave the school wanting to take out a group of strogois by themselves and of course Rose can't let that happen. She's running after them with Christian and finds more then she wished for. I am totally in love with Rose personality, her dilemma between Dimitri and Mason, her hard time dealing with her mother, her sense of honor and how she does everything to protect the ones she loves. She isn't perfect, she got her flaws and that's what makes her so interesting. You grow with her as the series develops. It is definitely my favorite series!

We are traveling to a small town. Hopefully there aren't any of those dangerous people. I am carrying Zelda. Her poor feet is hurt from walking just on slippers. We arrived at the town, there were only 4 houses that were in dark. It seems very lonely without people. We walk into one of the houses with four plates on the kitchen table still warm. Our stomachs start grumbling in hunger. ""Felix. I'm hungry"" She tugs on my shirt. ""We'll just eat a plate."" I feel guilty eating someone's food without permission. I take out my book and tore out a page. I start writing an apology note. Soon after we left the house seeing 3 people talking to German. We rushed to the side of the house so we don't get caught. One of those nazis heard a sound and is coming our way. Zelda starts grabbing my the wrist real hard. ""Walk back quietly. Be careful"" I whisper to her. Zelda steps on a stick make a large cracking noise. The nazi hears taking out his gun pointing it to my head. The nazi starts yelling in German. The other two approach us with loaded guns. I look down on my knees and hands. I try to yell but nothing comes out. The nazi starts pulling the trigger slowly. Zelda jumps onto the nazi and slaps him across the face. ""Stop!"" She yells. The nazi pushes my head against the house wall, pulls her by her hair and throws her onto the ground pointing the gun at her forehead. I try to stop them but I don't have the voice to. I feel very hopeless. I wish this could all end right now. Please help me. I fall to ground as the nazi strangles her. A gunshot fires. I get scared. I was too scared to look at Zelda. Hearing a body fall down I start crying. Another gun sort gets fired. A nazi starts yelling. A gun shot gets fired again with a body falling to the ground. I look up at the sound seeing a nazi crawl away crying out loud. The nazi was shot. I look at the other two nazis. They are dead on the ground shot. Zelda is struggling to get the nazi body away from her. I run to her helping her out ""You're safe!"" I say in joyfulness. ""Of course I am. Don't you know a-"" Before she finishes her sentence another gun shot fires at us hitting the house. I take Zelda and ran away. We run into the forest hiding. I search for the man who was shooting. He was not in sight, I thought it was safe to walk normally again. I was wrong. I soon as I stood up, I was shot in the leg. I scream in pain. The pain was unbearable. ""Felix!"" Behind us was another man with a gun. I thought Zelda and I were done. But I was wrong. The other man starts shooting at the person who was shooting as us. He saved us. He brought us to his house.

9781423146735,"On the one hand I'm happy to see this series ending, because it means the main characters can finally have some peace. On the other hand I am of course sad to see this ending, as I've come to love these characters and it isn't easy saying goodbye to them. We will still see a bit from Percy in his retelling of some ancient stories, but it just isn't the same. The group has split up again. While Nico, Reyna and Coach are bringing the Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half Blood, the rest is still on their way to Athens trying to stop Gaea from rising. It wouldn't be called a quest if there wasn't a lot of hardship and fights along the way. Though I have to say I had less of the feeling that all might die than in the previous books. Now there were two moments where I had my doubts, but in the end I'm very glad the way it was handled. Once again the demigods can only rely on themselves, now even more than before, since the gods are all still having problems with their split personalities and therefor are mostly fighting themselves. It's become clear that demigods have become stronger and mostly more confident in their ability. While in the past at times it seemed they were wary of throwing themselves into danger, that moment has passed and now they just go for it. As always you get completely sucked into the story. I really love all the different point of views we often get and all the hurdles they have to pass.While being very original, it also holds true to known mythology and that isn't always an easy balance. Now I personally beyond love mythology from every culture and the way Rick Riordan can turn those into these epic quests with all these amazing characters is spectacular. This was a great ending of the series and I've enjoyed every second of it. So while the story of Percy Jackson and the other demigods might be done, Rick Riordan isn't. Little teaser, though not really as it was announced on his book tour, but we're getting more demigods and this time we're talking Norse gods. I already know I'm going to love it!",Total Book Geek
9780312642976,"There aren't very many YA book series I recommend to everyone - but The Lunar Chronicles is one of them, and Cress convinced me of that! Cress is a great addition to Marissa Meyer's series, and fits in nicely with the first two books. On top of that, Cress stands out as its own book with its own story and characters - with this third book, you can readily see how different the characters are and how each book has a different ""feel"" to it! Reasons to Read: 1. Complex, detailed plot development: You see hints of this in Cinder and Scarlet, but by the time we get to Cress it's becoming clearer how much detail and thought Marissa has put in to this story. There are all sorts of secrets and twists that begin to make a lot of sense! 2. Cress' character stands out on her own: One of my favourite things about The Lunar Chronicles is how each female protagonist (Cinder, Scarlet, Cress so far) is so unique from the others. And Cress is so naive and anxious, yet such a dreamer! I kept telling my younger sister that she HAS to read this book because Cress reminds me so much of her - and I think Cress is going to resonate with many readers (particularly some younger ones is my guess) or for all of us with our awkward moments. 3. Fantastic balancing of a large cast of characters: At this point, there are a lot of characters bouncing around in Cress and it would be very easy for them to become muddled and confused but amazingly, they aren't. The story is set up with each character in a very specific position with their own unique purpose. To me, this is the best way to appreciate so many different characters at once. Of course, the downside of having so many characters is that even with 500+ pages, some characters just won't get the attention I'd like them to have (Scarlet, for example). I think Marissa does a remarkable job of keeping this from happening too much. Overall, I think Cress is the perfect addition to The Lunar Chronicles and an incredible third book! There's plenty of action, intrigue, and romance to easily hold the reader's attention and I easily and quickly read through its many pages. ARC received from Macmillan for review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9780312642976,"This review contains a few spoilers for the first two books in the series, Cinder and Scarlet. If you have not read them yetaEURAfff'| I suggest you do that now, because you're missing out. There also may be a few minor ones for Cress. Oh my stars, this was awesome. This is by far the best book of the series so far, for me personally. I loved it so much! I read it the minute I got it in my mail and I finished it that same day. Could not put it down. Cress is a action-packed, brilliantly written, amazing, wild roller coaster ride. And as soon as all of it has processed in my mind and I have written this review, I will go and cry because I will have to wait for a whole year for Winter. Cress is the third book in the Lunar Chronicles. In it we first meet Cress. She is a very talented hacker and has lived in a satellite for years as a prisoner, working for the Lunar Queen. But she has other plans and calls for help from our beloved gang. Cinder, Thorne, Wolf and Scarlet go to her rescue, but stuff happens and they get separated from each other. Cress and Thorne are catapulted down to Earth in the satellite, Scarlet is taken by Cresss mistress, Sibyl to Luna and Cinder and Wolf manage to escape in their ship to Africa where they meet with Dr. Erland. The clock is ticking and they have to find each other again and make a plan to stop Queen Levana. Yes, it is as awesome as it sounds. My heart was racing the entire time and I just had to keep on reading. While the other two books were a bit predictable, Cinder more than Scarlet, this one was not. Which had me sitting on the edge of my seat for all of the 550 pages. I think that's why I loved this one the most so far. The writing is still incredible and really, I bow to you Marissa. I really do. There is not much of a recap, so if it has been a year since you've read the other booksaEURAfff'| shame on you! You could've done a marathon and then crawl to a corner and cry like the rest of us because of the long wait for Winter. Seriously thoughaEURAfff'| A year? I don't compute. So stuff happens when they rescue Cress and they are separated. Scarlet is taken to Luna as a prisoner and even though she didn't have a lot of story in this book, it's still really intense. Especially towards the end. My god, Marissa, you are merciless! Which brings me to Thorne and Cress. When they crash to Earth (of course they don't die, the book would be over if they did, so it's not a spoiler), something happens to Thorne which makes him blind. At first I was raging mad at Marissa for doing that, because wellaEURAfff'| we all love Thorne. But he still is the same arrogant handsome jerk we all hate because we love him, so it's all good. They are stranded in the desert and I loved how they bonded. And Cress's first moments on Earth were actually pretty funny, because it reminded me of Rapunzel in the Disney movie Tangled when she first came out of her tower. (Yes, the song would fit perfectly for that moment in the book too.) Overall, Cress was pretty similar to Rapunzel from Tangled, which I loved because I love that movie. You know, she's a bit awkward around other people because she's been alone for all those years except for a few visits from her mistress. She's funny and yes I can picture her defending herself with a frying pan. But she's also an amazing hacker and a really great character and I loved her. Then we come to Cinder and Wolf. Wolf also doesnt have much of a story because hes knocked out for one part of the book and practically a zombie the other part. He worries about Scarlet, which does give him some character development. Cinder has a lot of pressure on her shoulders and in this book, shes really scared and worried. What if she cant save the world? What if her plan goes horribly wrong? And I loved that too because it means that shes no Mary Sue and it makes her more human too. But of course, shes still a bad ass cyborg Lunar princess so she kicks ass when she has too. That leaves us with the other minor characters. There's a new one (sort off), Jacin Clay. He's a Lunar Guard who actually helped Cinder and Wolf escape from the satellite. He's mentioned in the first book too if I remember correctly. Then we have Dr. Erland, also from book one. He's in Africa, where Cinder meets up with him and he also has a storyline, which I'm not going to talk about because that's a spoiler. So I'll move on to Kai, who I love again! In Scarlet, I had a love-hate relationship with him, but not anymore. He's a prince and he's hot and he actually does things right in this book. Well, for the most part anyway. That leaves us withaEURAfff'|. Levana. Yeah, still hate her. I'm not going to talk about all the other side characters, but I do want to mention one of them because she has a pretty big role in the fourth book! Yes, Winter makes an appearance towards the end. I won't spoil anything about it, all I'll say is that she's not what I thought she would be, in a very good way. And it makes me even more excited to read the next book. Stars, it seems I have a lot to say about these books. They are just so brilliant and I love them so much and I try to avoid thinking about how long the wait is for Winter. But time goes by very quick for me these days, so 2015 will be here before I realize. At least, that's what I hope. Of course I recommend this book! Fans of the series so far won't be disappointed and if you areaEURAfff'| I think you read another book. So if you haven't had the chance to start this one yet, brace yourself because you're in for a wild ride!",Bieke Paesen

I really want her to be with Cam but we all know that's not going to happen, I don't like writing bad reviews but I'm so disappointed, when I first started reading the books I was so excited but it was a big let down. I don't recommend this book.",Roxanne Foster
9780547258300,"Fantasy books were my first love when it came to reading, and I grew up on stories bursting with mythology, knights, and princesses (my favourites were those that had characters who could be both a knight AND a princess). Nothing gets my heart pounding and the pages turning like a magical, adventurous fantasy novel! I first heard of Graceling immediately after reading The Hunger Games a few years ago - I kept getting recommendations for it, but for whatever reason I didn't pick it up until recently. Waiting to read this book until now was one of the biggest mistakes in my reading history! I'm convinced that Kristin Cashore is a genius and this book is proof of that. Reasons to Read: 1.A richly developed fantasy world: This is a must for good fantasy books; I need to buy into the magical world and the best ones have a well-established world with its own rules and norms, but with enough similarities that we can relate to them. Plus, I like books that include MAPS of the fantasy worlds. That's pretty legit for me. And the names of places, things and people should be vaguely familiar but not so overdone that they come off as silly and fake. Graceling easily avoids any and all of these issues and stands as one of a few YA fantasy books that works so well! 2.Familiar problems & issues: I don't think it's much of a secret that Graceling delves into some questions regarding the role of women within a society and the obstacles in their way as equal members of society. What may be surprising, however, is how WELL Kristin deals with this and successfully weaves it into the story. I wouldn't call it subtle, but it is oh-so poignant. Katsa is a bit of an anomoly in her world, where women are often mistreated and lack the means to protect themselves; but as she slowly begins to recognize how problematic this is and ultimately questions if she can do anything about it. It's striking, and resonates so well because of how familiar it is to us. 3.Katsa & Po's friendship: I love Katsa, and I love Po! Even separately, they were fantastic characters that I found amusing and amiable. But it's the way that they played off each other and slowly grew closer together that truly sold me on them as characters and their role in the story. Here's a couple you can't help but root for the whole way through; and most of all, I loved seeing a respectful male lead who wants to encourage the heroine and do everything he can to help her in the way she needs and respect her decisions. So, I've now joined the ranks of Graceling/Kristin Cashore fans. I'm KICKING myself for waiting this long to have read it, and I've moved on to Fire already :) Graceling is a thought-provoking and addictive read, one that will leaving you craving more. I could honestly say so much more about this one, but I'm going to save it for a spoiler-filled review, coming soon :) Perfect read for anyone looking for a heartbreaking, emotionally touching, thought provoking read. This one has a well-deserved new space on my favourites shelf; and I can't wait to finish off Fire and then get started on Bitterblue (as soon as I manage to get my hands on a copy)! Thoughts on the audio: A few people had told me that I must listen to Graceling on audio because it was good- and they were right (again. Clearly I have awesome people recommending books to me). This would actually be a perfect book to introduce a new listener to audiobooks because it's Full Cast, although you'll also be spoiled by it for other books. Full Cast is fantastic because it's such a great quality; there are multiple narrators, all of whom are excellent. Plus there's a little bit of background music at times that helps create a good atmosphere for listening to the story. Hands down, the best, most addictive audio book I've ever listened to. WELL worth the cost of buying it! If you're new to audiobooks, or just haven't given this one a try yet then I HIGHLY recommend that you pick it up. Like now.",Brenna Staats

9780547258300,"In most of the seven kingdoms, people born with a Grace--an extreme skill that they can perform above all others--are usually feared. However, King Randa of the Middluns kingdom has exploited Katsa's ability to kill ever since her Grace surfaced at the tender age of eight. Katsa had even begun to think that maybe, in reality, she really was nothing but an attack dog, until one day she decided to follow her own will and let an innocent man live. Since then, she and her cousin, Prince Raffin, have put together a secret council to rescue people suffering from similar injustices. During a rescue mission to free the father of the Lienid king from a dungeon in Sunder, Katsa squares off with a Graced Lienid man who is almost her equal in fighting. When he shows up in Middluns, Katsa is dismayed to learn that he is one of the Lienid princes, nicknamed ""Po,"" in search of his missing grandfather. Although Katsa is at first wary of his intentions, she soon finds a kindred spirit in Po, and the two grow close as they set off on a journey to solve the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Po's grandfather. In Monsea, a kingdom isolated by mountains, Po's aunt and young cousin may be in grave danger... Akin to the tales of Tamora Pierce, this story features strong female characters and an exciting medieval world full of magic and action.

9781442426702,"This one started as an over-hyped book and I kinda wanted to distance myself because I don't have a good reputation with over-hyped books. But I did manage to read it after getting excited from various people. My verdict? It was all right. I liked it enough and had certain issues with it at the same time. That's when I rate it as a three. I liked this one. It reminded me so much of the sisterly relationship in Little Women (which is one of my favourites). Lara Jean is the middle child and our main character. Margot is clearly the responsible one. Kitty is the youngest and the feisty sister. I loved their dynamics and their interactions with each other. I love the sisters dynamics, how different they all are. How incredibly close they all are too. It was my favourite part of the book. I also liked the mystery surrounding who she gave her letters to. Sometimes it helped me root for one guy and then for the other. In the end, I didn't have anyone to root for except Lara Jean herself. I was wishing this would be a stand-a-lone but it wasn't since it ended on a cliffhanger. Hopefully she picks the right guy for her. Overall, it was a cute and fun read and the hype was a little too much for it. I did love the cover since it pictured a POC on it. YAY.",Giselle SM

My Blog: http://landamac.weebly.com ""When someone's been gone a long time, at first you save up all the things you want to tell them. You try to keep track of everything in your head. But it's like trying to hold on to a fistful of sand: all the little bits slip out of your hands, and then you're just clutching air and grit."" When I started to read this book I was not liking it, seriousy... Before this book I've finished a Sci-Fi book and it was a BIG pain in the ass to get used to this kind of story again. But then I continued reading and I have to tell this: This book is amazing! I laughed so much in the first 200 pages of this book, it was so funny... Lara Jean is a really funny and unpredictable girl/character. The true thing is that I loved this book a lot and I was reading it and when I was almost over my heart was beating really fast because I knew that the second book expected publication is only in 2015! I was about to die and I'm not kidding... I was so stupid when I bought this book without the second one released. But, after all, I am really glad I did it, because I loved it and it was really cute and really funny and all the time I was reading my feelings were switching places (like switching boys) and I was doing strange ""aaaawww"" or ""oowwin"" sounds (yap, I'm a pretty strange girl). ""You'd rather make up fantasy version of somebody in your head than be with a real person."" This story is about a girl named Lara Jean. She's 16 years old, she has 2 sisters (one with 18 and another one with 9) and a single father because her mom died when she was a kid. Before her mom died she gave Lara Jean a secret box of letters, so Lara Jean started to write letters to ""all the boys that she has loved before"". The problem is that her box was not anymore under her bed and the letters has been mailed and now every boy that she liked recieved one letter from her.",Orlanda Machado
9781442426702,"I wanted to read this one since I saw it on YA Romantics, and loved the premise. I can only imagine the waves that letters helping her get over boys she'd loved were actually mailed. You can't take words back and I wonder what sort will be unleashed on unsuspecting boys. I wasn't expecting the strong family dynamics in this one, and it really was well done and a positive surprise. Our main character Lara is really close with her older sister Margot and younger Kitty. They band together to help their single dad (mom died). They really work for each other's happiness, and have a bond that only loss, time and being family can form. The first boy that Lara gets over is her older sister's boyfriend Josh. He was the next door neighbor and was around and friends with them even longer than he had a relationship with Margot, so I can def see where Lara would fall for him. Plus, he is a good guy, being nice and playing with Kitty, hanging out with their dad, and is thoughtful and fun. This is such a hard subject though because you know that it would only hurt the bond if Lara was ever to act on or admit her feelings, but we also know this will happen because of the summary, so I was anxious at how that would effect their friendship and relationship. I also couldn't pull for Lara to get him because I saw how much he cared for Margot. It still added another element to the story because I had to know if he ever felt anything back and how Lara continues to deal with it. Lara Jean herself is such a fun narrator. She is quirky and thinks a lot like me, she doesn't quite fit into the old crowd of friends she had, but she isn't unpopular persay. She is smart but she is more of a homebody than the average high schooler, also like me. She isn't perfect and that is what makes her even greater. She makes questionable decisions, says things that hurts her sister, and she has bad days. But she rebounds, she figures out a way to get through, and even when she makes a stack of lies, something I know I have done before, she doesn't weasel out of any responsibility of consequences. It was fun to watch her grow and deal with the changes in her life, and watch her to learn a person not just from a fantasy in her mind but up close and personal. The romance was different, and while I have read a setup that shares similarities it was pretty new to me, and interesting to see how it played out and how their decisions effected themselves, the other person and those around them. I ended up liking guy in question more than I thought that I could and he surprised me on more than one occassion (Lara too) at how deep he could actually be and what was hidden behind his good looks. I especially loved how he ended up being at the house with Lara and Kitty a lot and how he treated Kitty like a real person and joked with her, making her feel included and special. I liked that their dad tried so hard to be a good parent. He probably missed his wife so much he couldn't think some days, but he kept the girls, and they stuck together. He made the awkward talks with them, and tried to take back some of the responsibilities that the girls took on to help him, he tried to let them be kids. Even though he worked hard, he wasn't an absent parent, and when he was home, he did things with the family instead of holing up or going out. I enjoyed it and flew through the story. I will def be picking up the next book and can't wait to see more from the life of the Song girls, especially Lara Jean. Bottom Line: It was a fast, sweet, sometimes emotional book with a romance I could get behind, a premise I loved, a quirky main character, and sweet romance.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

I am a huge fan of Jenny Han and I automatically buy every book she releases. I had such huge hopes for this book, and like always, Jenny Han did not let me down! I loved this book, a 5/5 stars for me! There was so many things going on in this book, under the surface. There was the love story that was the centre plot but underneath that there were many sub-plots dealing with a?? family, high-school, grief, growing up a?? just to name a few! And I really appreciated that, it made this book different from all the other romance novels. As for the plot, I thought it was very well done and there were a couple of things that surprised me, which made the book even more fun! The pacing was steady and there was a lot of character development throughout that impressed me! As for the characters, therea??s Lara Jean, our protagonist, and she lives in a dream-like bubble that eventually bursts and she begins to grow and mature, and I loved reading that! Her younger sisters, Kitty, just cracked me up, she was hilarious! Her dad and older sister were interesting and I enjoyed reading about their family interaction! Plus her sister went to SCOTLAND (where I live) for university so that was awesome to hear! And of course, last but not least, the love interests. Peter was the typical popular guy but he had his vulnerable moments and I grew to love him, even though he had some major flaws! Then therea??s Josh who was so sweet and nerdy but I loved him too! These two tugged at my heart and I ended up rooting for each of them at separate times in the book and even now I dona??t know who I want Lara Jean to end up with! Overall, this book was sweet, light and slightly cheesy read but therea??s just something about Jenny Hana??s writing that I just love and I highly recommend this book to everyone, especially contemporary readers!",brookexx

The story never slowed down, I never once got bored in this book and I didn't want to put it down and was quite different than my average reads. . It was a very funny book. I did like the storyline and the characters. I really liked how the author put a spin on what the ""normal"" I loved the main character, he was well written and made me laugh a lot. I was able to relate to him throughout the book and I feel like a made a good friend. The title is cute and the cover is kind of boring in my opinion, but I honestly can't think of anything that would look better. I would read this book again, and I would tell my friends to read it. I'd rate it a 4/5",Ashlea McDaid
9780307931894,"As intriguing and somewhat disastrous the scenario may seem, Levithan perfected it into an addictive story of the conflict between selflessness and desire. I practically inhaled this book and was almost heart broken when it ended, unwilling to return to reality.",Jesse Robert Spence
9781595827487,"This comic book is an collection of all the comics ever published of Avatar the Last Airbender(Nickelodeon Magazine, Comics from the DVD's etc.) Next to that, this collection also includes a few new comics which haven't been seen before (We even get to see Aang's fire nation friend Kuzon!!). All of the comics take place during the original cartoon series. The comics itself are a great read, some of them really gives you that feeling you got when you were watching new episodes of the cartoon. The art changes throughout the book because many different artists worked on the comics. Some comics have breathtaking art, close to the cartoon quality, Others are a bit less of quality. All in all, any Avatar fan should be overjoyed with this collection. So if you have any friends who love the series, this surely would make a great gift.",Lysanne Reijmers
9781595141743,"I start this review with the utmost trepidation because... well here's a book that pretty much every YA reader on the planet loves. It has crazy amounts of crazy fans and, well, I didn't think it was fantastic. It wasn't bad either. It did make me want to bash my head against the wall at some points (we'll get to that), but some other points were genuinely good. But did it have me jumping out of my chair, bursting with joy, ecstatic about the awesome? Far from it. Let's add some context of my reading situation, because I don't want to lead you on. I am not a vampire fan. In fact, I'm pretty much a vampire hater. I get creeped out by them, I don't think sucking blood is sexy, it's just not for me. So I was planning to just avoid this, and never read it (as with all books with 'vampires' in the title/synopsis), but no. *tsks* My friends couldn't leave well enough alone. And the awesome Judith made me an offer I couldn't refuse (ha) by sending the book to me so I wouldn't even have to buy it or find some other place to borrow it. So obviously, I had to read it. But by that time I was curious. I mean, I might like it. I might hate it. Curiosity was getting the better of me. So while I was still very skeptical about it, I set off on my reading journey, deciding to liveblog it on Twitter (#vampirehaterreadsVA) to provide some LOLs or impressions. My problem with Vampire Academy surprisingly is not the vampire aspect. Usually, I'm, like, vampires? EW. And I was scared, when I started reading, that already on page 3 there was a ""feeding"" scene. I thought it wouldn't end well. But the vampire aspect is rather tame, to be honest. As Rose herself is not a vampire but a Dhampir, a half-blood vampire bodyguard, that typical stuff is kept largely out of the picture. In fact, I quite liked these vampires. Much better than Twilight, in any case. These vampires are harmed by the sun, can wield elemental magic, and have an old fashioned monarchical, classist society. I do kind of dislike that their saliva is like a drug to the people they feed on, but... I managed to ignore that for the most part. So what was my biggest problem with Vampire Academy? What made me want to throw the book across the room and bash my head against the wall sometimes? Rose. Yes, I know, you're all gaping at the screen right now. ""How could she say that??? Rose is the most badass character ever!!!"" Well, tough. You should already be proud of me that it's not the vampire thing bugging me. But here's the thing with Rose. Everyone says she's badass. Sure, she's reckless, loud, honest and won't take **** from anybody. But. There's a fine line between being awesomely badass and being obnoxiously cocky and conceited. And I feel like Rose crosses that line many, many times. Some examples of what I mean: ""The incident had given me a dangerous reputation, in addition to my smartass one. The story had gained legendary status, and I liked to imagine that it was still being told around campfires late at night."" - Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead ""Natalie was nice but also one of the most uninteresting people I knew."" - Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead ""I knew I was pretty, but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risque way.""- Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead ""He was boring, yes, but safe. Just like Natalie. How come all the harmless people were so lame?"" - Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead ""I knew perfectly well that there weren't a lot of girls at this school who looked as good in a bra as I did.""- Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead Now, okay, you're all probably still glaring at me. Because, yes, to a certain extent it is refreshing to have a main character with a bit higher self-esteem than most. But when it's page after page of comments like this... Seriously, in some parts, on each page Rose was belittling different characters in her narrations, particularly Natalie - all the time. I got sick of her attitude. I wanted to throw the book across the room. It's a brand of cocky I can't take. Now, I want to be perfectly honest: had I not borrowed this book from Judith, and had it not had all this praise from everyone who's read it, I would have given up. That's how badly she pissed me off. All the time I was reading, I just kept thinking... ""please run in front of a bus."" Luckily... I can say that she did seem to have grown a little by the end of the book. But I'm still extremely weary of her. She still needs a reality check and a slap across the face. (Also, the way she's so flirty and devil-may-care with her sexual reputation really bothered me for the fact that she was still a virgin.) So I kept reading and kept reading... I didn't really know why. It's a really simple read, compulsively readable, one might say. I was sometimes annoyed by the juvenile narrations, but I set that aside, just because it read so quickly. But yeah, the writing style leaves more to be desired. The plot never really hooked me either. I kept waiting and waiting to be sucked in or blown away, but it never happened. I had no clue where the story was going (and not in the good way, in the ""where the hell is my plot?"" way) and there was no real mystery sucking me in either. I was reading this just to read it because I'd promised friends I would. The plot was just... boring? average? However, this negativity all out of the way, there were things I liked too. I liked Christian - he was probably my favorite character, because his devil may care attitude closely resembled my own attitude while reading this. I gradually warmed up to Dimitri, though I am not a screaming fangirl for him by any means. Lissa was really intriguing to me, and I think she's mostly why I kept reading, all things said and done. Her friendship with Rose was... interesting. I like it, for the most part. The last quarter of the book was truly enjoyable though. Things finally started happening - interesting things (and not childish boarding school bitch wars). The romance between Rose and Dimitri certainly is hot. There's no getting around that. It definitely caught my attention, and I enjoyed it. And, as I said, Rose appeared to have grown a little. Action-esque plot things happened, some reveals were made, but nothing really blew my mind. It was fun to read, but, turning to the final page, I was still waiting to be wowed. Summing Up... This is... a guilty pleasure read. Certainly, it has mass market appeal, proven by the screaming fangirls and glowing reviews. While it did have points of merit, I'm still not blown away. It was an all right read, but, to me, not really worth of all the hype. It's a fast and easily digestible read, there's hot boys, but Rose remains a stumbling block for me. Will I continue with the series? I honestly don't know. I've heard it gets better and better, and the third book is particularly amazing, but I don't know if it's really worth my time if I'm not convinced here. And I don't know if Rose will really grow or if she will just continue to irritate me. Maybe I'll pick the second book up when I have cleared out my to-read list, have some free time, and want some nice romance on a rainy day. Because, yeah, I'd probably just be reading it for the romance. Recommended To... Err... I don't know. I'm probably the black sheep here. Most readers would like it.",Unknown
9781595141743,I read through the book pretty quickly than my normal pace. I took close to 2 days to complete it. I really really love the way Rose is not those typical YA teenage girls we read about. It's a good thing that the author doesn't beat about bush unlike some authors but instead go straight to the point and deliver it to us. That explains why I'm able to read through it soo quickly because unnecessary content is almost nonexistent. I've heard that the rest of the books are getting better and better and I hope i can get hold of 'em now. Check out my blog for other reviews: http://blairthebookaholic.blogspot.sg/,Belinda Loh
9781595141743,"So I started reading this book, a year or two back and absolutely loved it. I have now got all the books in the series and even the spin offs for this series. Richelle Mead has made the characters so real! I love Rose and Lissa's friendship, its jealous worthy. I have read these books over and over. I hope they make a movie about this series because its way better then Twilight. I would recommend buying this book if you love a little romance, action and some drama.",Brooke Bianco
9781595141743,"So I FINALLY jumped on the VA bandwagon - I feel like I'm the last person to have read it! I was lucky enough to get an ARC of Bloodlines last summer for review and decided to give it a shot - much to my surprise, I totally fell in love and it wasn't until I read Bloodlines that I actually had a desire to read VA! I can totally see what all the fuss is about - I'm not a huge fan of vampires or paranormal books in general, but I really love that VA doesn't feel like every other vampire book out there. And a pretty awesome, strong lead female definitely helps too! Reasons to Read: 1.This isn't your standard YA vampire fare: I love that Richelle incorporated her own twists on vampires and different elements. To be honest, the vampires in the VA world very rarely felt like traditional vampires - or even vampires at all - for most of this first book. They just seemed so normal and, well, more like fancy humans. Especially since Rose is a dhampir. And I LOVE the magic aspect to it. 2.Great blend of paranormal and contemporary: I also love that this one isn't overloaded with paranormal events and elements; there's a distinct contemporary feel to it, similar in the way that a lot of the characters go through very real, very familiar struggles. It definitely makes them easier to relate to, it's just more exciting than any of the highschool drama I ever witnessed haha. 3.Rose is a very different sort of main character: I think in YA, we kind of get used to reading about the misfit characters - ones who aren't entirely confident, or just don't feel like they fit in. In some ways, Rose definitely is a misfit and there are times when her confidence is a bit lacking... but overall, she isn't like that. She's very confident about herself, overall, and often does find ways to fit in and roll with the punches. It's nice to live vicariously through characters like her at times. And while there were a few times where I could easily see how immature and young she was (which isn't a bad thing, it's factual) I also know that there's plenty of room for improvement in that area too (seeing as there are a whole bunch of books in the series). 4.Strong female friendships: I know that there are some special reasons why Lissa and Rose are bonded together, but I find it so heartening to read about two characters who can be so close as friends. Too often I feel like the good friends take the backseat in books, or turn out to be jerks. But these two such depths of loyalty and mutual concern for each other, something which I wish we saw more of in YA books. And yes, there's definitely action. And mystery. Plenty of other elements to keep you intrigued and easily hold your attention for the book and leave you looking for more at the end. But at the same time, I could definitely tell that this book was really more of a set up for later books because it lacked a lot of the excitement and action I was highly anticipating after hearing so much about these books. And there were too many times when people just felt far too oblivious to what was going on around them. I definitely have the impression that I'll love the later books though. Lastly, I also don't feel like I missed out by reading Bloodlines & The Golden Lily first. Yes, I am definitely spoiled for some things - but honestly, I never would have read VA without Bloodlines. And I didn't find Bloodlines confusing without having read VA, but I believe I'm in the minority on that one. Thoughts on the audio: The other bit that might have taken away from my experience was the audio and narration itself. I didn't love the narrator, but I did get used to her voice. The problem was when she switched to different voices for other characters - Lissa and Mia were just far too annoying, and I really can't stand the Dimitri voice. My sister told me at one point that it reminded her of an old Russian lady, and after that I just couldn't picture anything else.",Brenna Staats
9781595141743,"If I had the time, I'd write a review on every single book in this series. Because they are all THAT good. You read one and just can't help but want to rush to the store (or online on Amazon, in my case), and buy the next book. A long-time vampire fan, I have sometimes high expectations of a good vampire story. I expect that if you're going to deviate from the traditional ""Dracula"" formula, that you PLEASE make yours a believable one. Make it something that can be built upon. Something that is well thought-out and seamless. Something that will continue to impress and surprise the readers with how well the author planned everything out. Well, Ms. Mead certainly gave that to me and more. Because amidst a very well-planned plotline, there's also a very detailed vampire mythology here that Ms. Mead crafted brilliantly. From the ""good vampire""/""bad vampire"" (Moroi vs. Strigoi) and dhampir to the blurring the lines of who's good and who's really bad. It's an exciting adventure that will leave you feeling like you lost some friends when all is said and done. But, specifically, I believe this first installment is a gem all on its own. We get the foundation for Rose and Lissa's amazing friendship, a budding relationship that is a bit taboo, between Rose and Dimitri--her teacher, and a look at what it means for Lissa to be a Princess among Moroi. Just writing this review makes me want to go pick up the book and start reading it all over again. For probably the fifth time.",Christy @ Captivated Reading
9781595141743,"A world of living vampires where the good go to school to learn elemental magic, where the dead hunt the living for their powerful living vampire blood - and where Guardians are standing between the two. Rose is a guardian in training or she was until she escaped with her best friend Lissa a living vampire called the Moroi. Their two year escape has come to an end as Dimitri, a Guardian, finds them and brings them back to the Academy where they are protected against the Srigoi, the vampires who kill and feed on the Moroi, with spells and wards. As safe as Vladimir's Academy is there are still dark forces stirring trouble for Lissa and Rose, the trouble they originally escaped. And trouble that has been waiting for them to return, not everyone is happy they are back, and schools are notoriously catty, and there is the wicked tongues spreading gossip and rumors and causing trouble for both the quiet and timid Lissa and bad tempered, not-shy-to-sock-you Rose. While Rose has to tip toe around the evil ""high school"" students and their malicious plans, to stay with Lissa, whom she has a special bond with, see they cannot be apart for Rose can feel Lissa's emotions and more which makes her her ideal guardian to come. This bond comes in handy when things begin to go seriously awry, dead animals show up on Lissa's life someone trying to shock her and make her reveal that there is more to Lissa than a timid observer of events - she might have not specialized in one elemental magic yet but there is something about her... Dimitri who originally took them back to school, also has Rose's extra training in his hands, she has two years to catch up to, and also he's appointed Lissa's Guardian while she's in school, which means Rose and Dimitri spend a lot of time together and it's hard to stay completely professional, which is really all they can ever be, but there is electricity between them and it grows harder and harder to ignore. /Quote: ""So I suggested to Dimitri that maybe he should let me off this time. He laughed, and I was pretty sure it was at me and not with me. ""Why is that funny?"" ""Oh,"" He said, his smile dropping. ""You were serious."" ""Of course I was! Look, I've technically been awake for two days. Why do we have to start this training now? Let me go to bed,"" I whined. ""It's just one hour."" He crossed his arms and looked down at me. His earlier concern was gone. He was all business now. Tough love. ""How do you feel right now? After the training you've done so far?"" ""I hurt like hell."" ""You'll feel worse tomorrow."" ""So?"" ""So, better to jump in now while you still feel...not as bad."" ""What kind of logic is that?"" I retorted. But I didn't argue anymore as he led me into the weightroom. He showed me the weights and reps he wanted me to do, then sprawled in a corner with a battered Western novel. Some god. /End Quote. I highly recommend this book! It's a school of vampires who live like teenagers do with the drama of who slept with who, whose parents are scum, whose life is all drama and who are the cool kids or in their case The Royals - but they also deal with the constant threat of Strigoi and the heavy training schedule of the twining race of Dhamphir, half-vampire, Guardians. Very entertaining Young Adult read even for a us who are getting closer to thirty! If you see me in the library today it's because I'm picking up ""Frostbite"" the Book #2 of Vampire Academy series.",Niina C

9780062024060,"I expected the day ALLEGIANT was released to be the day that would part the YA readership. Excessively enthusiastic readers on one side, shattered or even enraged readers on the other. And then my first reaction: perplexity. I just didn't know what to make of ALLEGIANT. Well, at least it made me think. A lot. In the days following the end of the DIVERGENT trilogy I caught myself drifting back to the story of Tris and Four and the other ALLEGIANT characters and reassessing its ending more than once. It was shocking but brave. Encouraging but devastating. I'd never been so torn about a book rating After the cliffhanger we were presented with in INSURGENT, a profound background to Veronica Roth's faction world was demanded. And Veronica Roth did everything to supply her readers with theories, information and answers. But at some point, I had a feeling that anything in the story needed a long explanation, turning the third book more into a social or behavioral study than the adrenaline-rush-inducing rollercoaster ride that was DIVERGENT and INSURGENT. It was a massive mission to wrap up a story and a world such as the one we were presented with in DIVERGENT, a very complex world. What is power and who wields it? Where can you find the truth in a world controlled by lies? Is humanity still existent and what do Tris and Four have to do to retrieve it? ALLEGIANT is written from the alternating perspectives of Tris and Four. SO GOOD, I tell you. Both perspectives were dynamic and insightful, complementing the other just naturally. As Veronica Roth so fitly described them in an interview with BuzzFeed: ""Tris voice is very stereotypically masculine, very straightforward, very direct, kind of repetitive. Tobias is a little more poetic, a little more descriptive, and he generally shares more. Tris is always withholding, but Tobias shares everything""* Tris and Four even out their weaknesses and underline their strenghts. They are nowhere near a perfect couple. They have flaws and make mistakes, the important part is, that they are both very aware of them and they openly show and consciously reflect them. The moments they got to show their closeness made me adore Four and them both as a couple even more, but somehow those moments felt bittersweet with all the difficulties that still lay ahead of them. No matter what, Tobias, you make readers fall in love with you over and over again. In DIVERGENT, INSURGENT, ALLEGIANT and every future re-read. There was a time in the book when things started to fall back into an old pattern. People gathering and planning an uproar. I'm not saying that a world as the one Tris and Four are living in doesn't need those people. Active and intelligent people who see the needs of those who can't stand up for themselves. But by the end of the DIVERGENT series it seemed like I'd seen so many different groups of variously motivated people that Tris and Four always get involved with, it was too much and often only caused a lot of relationship drama. I'm not giving less than five stars because the story didn't end the way I wanted it to end. I thought a lot about that ending of ALLEGIANT and what Veronica Roth must have imagined and aimed at while thinking it out and writing it. I can't exactly say what the last third of Allegiant felt like. It was a mass of emotions, mostly a combination between consternation and awe. Initial thoughts after finishing ALLEGIANT were: Why did I ever pick up this series? and Why do I do this to myself? Obviously, I didn't mean them. At the end of ALLEGIANT we were left with a solution to the big conflict that had been brewing in DIVERGENT and INSURGENT and inevitably a mass of inconceivably sudden and tragic losses, yet not without a note of hope. And hope is all there has to be in the end. The ending wasn't what I expected...at all! But it was the ending that made ALLEGIANT a so much better read in the aftermath. 4,5/5 ****/* ALLEGIANT - A revolutionary, brave read, not missing out in the heartbreak department, that slams into you like a train on full speed. Veronica Roth doesn't hold back. ALLEGIANT aka the book that should be named HEARTBREAK wields the power to tear out every reader's heart. A few hours after reading ALLEGIANT my distraught emotions quieted and I could clear my mind enough to calm down and don't be so upset anymore. And then, strangely, I found the ending soothing in some way. I'm mostly trying to appreciate Veronica Roth's achievement as a writer and to cope with the way she ended things, saying Good-bye to the ones we lost in the DIVERGENT trilogy and trying to see the moral and aspiration that's behind it all.",MissPageTurner
9780062024060,"Short Non Spoiler Review: Fast paced, action filled (towards the end), answer fulfilling book. You will be nervous, you will be mad, you will be devastated. Prepare yourself. Still read it. Long Spoilerful (I realize this isn't a word) Review: What to the what just happened. My heart is broken. I am devastated. I feel empty. Why Veronica WHYYY?!?! *Tears and ugly sobbing* Ok so that was what was going through my mind upon finishing Allegiant. Having been able to think it over for a little while I get why Veronica killed Tris. Well I get what makes sense to me, whether it's what Veronica was going for I don't know. It's a dystopian book, things are dark. It's not a fairytale and although we wish for happily ever after we don't always get it. Veronica kept it real by killing off Tris, she showed us that sometimes in order to get to the good you have to go through the bad. I'm not happy Tris died and I can think of all sorts of ways things could have gone so she wouldn't have had to, but its not my story. Moving on. Up until the end I was very pleased with how the book was going. It really answered a lot of questions. In fact the book was mostly informational compared to the action packed Divergent and Insurgent books. It was also different from the first two books because the story was being told from both Tris and Tobias' POVs. (That should have served as a warning really) I didn't think I would like it, mostly because I don't go for books told from a male POV, but in my opinion it was nicely done. Others seem to think the POVs were too similar too each other, basically that Tobias seemed a little feminine, maybe that's why I was ok with it. I was angry with Tris and Tobias pretty much the whole book, ok I was angry mostly at Tobias, for letting their relationship fall apart. I hated Tobias for not trusting Tris and for making dumb decisions. Of course he eventually smartens up and the make up (and more possibly). I think that helps to make me more sad about Tris' death. They had just gotten back to good and were looking forward to planning their lives together then BAM it gets taken away from them. Overall I don't regret reading this series. Divergent was my first dystopian book and really is what turned me on to the genre. That being said, Allegiant really makes me think twice about reading another dystopian. It really opened my eyes to the fact that authors really hold the power to break your heart and that there is no rule stating they have to make a book end happy. Looking back I wish I would have waited a little longer to read Allegiant, just so it would have prolonged the sadness. I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me. -Excerpt from Allegiant by Veronica Roth *Tears in my eyes* Find more reviews: http://readbookswilltravel.blogspot.com",S.Huston
9780062024060,"It is really hard for me to write reviews for series enders, because it is sad to leave characters that I have grown to love and invested so much time into. So, this will be short, spoiler free. I was drawn right back into the world of Tobias and Tris in this bittersweet conclusion to the series. Though I did rush through the middle because it slowed down got too weighty in the middle, it picked right back up. There were lots of surprises, and things I both expected, dreaded and couldn't wait for. I loved getting into Four's head and getting his perspective. It was an added bonus in this and gave us some valuable insight. Tris is as strong as ever, even though she has her flaws, that makes her even more relatable, and easy to like and pull for. She has the recklessness, but also the courage and sacrifice that defines her. There is non-stop action in this one, tying up loose ends and resolving all of the plots. OMG. The ending. I am one of the people who are torn. I hate it and saw it coming, but at the same time I love it and think it is fitting. It depends on what moment you ask me.

9781853260322,"It is a peculiar case: some very interesting characters and family dynamics, with a wealth of layered detail, but I found the basic social message of the book rather uncongenial. Austen's heroine is Fanny Price, informally adopted by her rich uncle and aunt; Fanny is generally passive and when she expresses an opinion tends towards priggishness (with the author's full approval); the stable conservative world of Mansfield Park is under threat from the cosmopolitan horrors of London, but Fanny supports the resistance. Most of the climactic events take place off-screen in the last few chapters, which is a bit unsatisfying. (Also the kind rich uncle clearly has made his money thanks to slavery.) The book does have its points of interest, but I would advise anyone thinking of casual dabbling in Austen to stick to Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion.",Nicholas Whyte
9780141340104,"I was reluctant to continue the 'Matched' series, because I lost the drive to continue it even though I liked the first book a lot. I remember loving the poetic writing style and how beautifully the plot was written out in each chapter. But I learned not to expect the second book will be as good as the first one. And true to my expectations, Crossed by Ally Condie was disappointing. It did have the same poetic writing style and beautiful breezy formatting and plot division. But it was too poetic that I just started getting bored really fast. There was too much inner monologuing and way too much references to actual poems. And eventually, the book felt like it didn't have much substance. The plot continues where the first book left out and follows the characters Cassia and Ky, each getting their own chapters right after each other. I usually loved how some authors like to divide the chapters like that and the way we get to know what's on the mind of both the female and male protagonist. But in this book, I just hated it. And the only thing the book made me feel was impatience because I wanted the book to end! Crossed by Ally Condie is well-written but lacks the plot and factor to keep a reader interested. A good read for the fans of the 'Hunger Games' and 'Divergent'",Najla Qamber
9781250027436,"Originally posted at: A Girl that Likes Books When fire burns, it uses up the wood. It devours it, leavening only ash. Grisha power doesn't work that way. Why I read this book I heard people talking about this new series in 2012. It had a very good premise, saying it used Russian mythos elements and so I considered I would like it. Once it got on sale at the Book Depository I decided to go for it. It also makes part of my Once Upon a Time Challenge. What the book is about The main characte, Alina Starkov, has always been a bit sickly looking and weak. She is an orphan that join the first army along with his good friend Mal...Whom she is also attracted to. On day, her regiment tries to cross what is known as The Fold, an area of the country covered in darkness, where evil creatures lurk. Is here that she almost looses both her life and Mal and it is when her powers surge saving both of them. She will now have to leave the first army to join the second, the Grisha, dealing with the little Science. Her powers might be able to get rid of the Fold...or they could give someone else infinite power to abuse. First impressions I would say that it took inspiration of Russian folklore, albeit with a fair amount of literary license taken. There is not a lot of world building at the beginning although it does feel like it would be settled on a very cold part of Russia. Characters are interesting but a bit predictable. Final thoughts I think the book itself is physically pretty, both the cover and the map were visually pleasing. The division between the different Grishas according to their powers was interesting, but not particularly different from other books with similar stories. Now, the story itself is not completely original, taking the ""ugly duckling"" type of story and mixing it worth magic and some Russian inspired words and constructions. I liked the comparison of the magic to science, when considered as manipulation of matter, but there wasn't a lot of development there. I believe this might be tackled in the sequel. I am conflicted to give this less than a 4, because while the story was not great I got immersed in it pretty fast. I finished the book in a 2 day weekend and basically devoured it. Maybe it is because I needed something light at the moment and it delivered exactly what I was expecting of the book but I liked it enough to preorder the paperback edition of the sequel. Hopefully I'm not disappointed. And there is nothing wrong with being a lizard either. Unless you were born to be hawk.",Carolina Gomez
9781250027436,"When I first picked this book up at the end of a long day I thought I would just have a quick dip in it to see how the opening flowed. Well I thought I would just read the opening chapter so at 11pm I dipped in to Shadow and Bone the next thing I knew it was after midnight and I was a hundred pages in wishing I didn't have to go to bed I just wanted to continue reading. It is a gripping fantasy, I have heard it described as a mix of Potter, Twilight and the Hunger Games, such tosh it is far superior to them. More in the Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings mode good verses bad, and love that conquers all even at the worst of times. Shadow and Bones is supposed to be in the YA genre but any adult should read this as there a twists and turns up and down and a brilliant story. We are introduced to two orphans at the beginning of the book Alina and Mal as young children and their incredible bond that will keep them together throughout of the story. How Mal at the beginning protects Alina who is all skin and bones and that when crossing the Shadow Fold it is Alina who saves Mal with a power she did not know she possessed. It is this power throughout the book that she needs to harness so that she can finally defeat the Shadow Fold and reunite Ravka. It is through this power that she is at first guided by the Darkling and is able to see that absolute power corrupts and that she needs to stand up to him and fight for what is good. It would be so easy to tell the whole story here but that would spoil the reason and the fun for buying this great book. I would recommend buying this book and join Alina in her fight for what is right and enjoy her love of Mal the great tracker. Buy, Buy, Buy it now.",Paul D
9780375836947,"Looking For Alibrandi is the first novel by Australian author, Melina Marchetta. The year that Josephine Alibrandi turned seventeen was filled with life-changing events: she had to pass her HSC; she met her father for the first time; she fell in love; she learned some shocking facts about her family; and someone close to her committed suicide. She also learned the importance of family, of knowing her history, of being responsible, of having good friends and of being one. Marchetta's novel touches on reputation, on the stigma of illegitimacy in certain cultures, on sex in young adults, on the assimilation of different cultures and on the expectation to follow in parents footsteps. It is easy to see how this novel would appeal to younger readers: the issues are relevant even if references to songs, events and personalities mean that it is a bit dated now. It is no surprise that it won the 1993 Children's Book of the Year Award for Older Readers, the 1993 Multicultural Book of the Year Award and the 1993 Variety Club Young People's Category of the 3M Talking Book of the Year Award. A moving read.",Marianne Vincent
9781416975861,"(Source: I own a copy of this book.) 16-year-old Tessa Gray is travelling from New York to London to meet with her only living relative - her brother Nate. When Tessa arrives in England she is met by two women - the Dark sisters, who claim to have been sent to collect her by Nate. Soon Tessa realises that instead she is being held prisoner, and is forced to learn a terrible craft - shape-shifting. Eventually Tessa is rescued from the Dark Sisters, and finds herself living at an institute with people who call themselves 'Shadow Hunters'. The shadow hunters all seem to have their own problems though, and Tessa has a lot to learn about Will, Jem, and Jessamine. Why were the Dark Sisters holding Tessa? Who is the Magister? What has become of her brother Nate? And what exactly is Tessa? This was a great book, and a great companion to the Mortal Instruments series. Tessa was a bookworm who loved her brother, and did what needed to be done for her family. She was brave and honourable and always did what she felt was right. She was also quietly clever and witty, and managed to talk her way out of a few arguments. Will was a bit of an odd character, and I'm pretty sure that he was hiding quite a lot of secrets. I'm not really sure what is going on with him, but he is certainly one to watch. Jessamine came across as quite spoiled and bratty, but I found some of her comments really funny. I totally got why she was trying to not be a shadow hunter though, it can't be an easy life. I liked the storyline in this book, although I did think the story could have been compacted a little into a shorter book. I liked that characters were recognisable as ancestors of the characters in the Mortal Instruments series, and liked how the two series tied together. I thought the idea of the clockwork automatons was quite clever, and liked how the identity of the magister was concealed until quite late in the story. I did guess parts of the plotline, but not all of it, and there were quite a lot of questions still to be answered by the end of the book. There was a bit of romance in this story, but I think we are being set up for another love triangle! The ending however was a cliff-hanger. What more could we expect than a cliff-hanger from Cassandra Clare! Overall; a great start to the series. 8.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781416975861,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/review-clockwork-angel-by-cassandra-clare/ Clockwork Angel, to be put simply, is a beautifully woven tale of mystery and romance. I have a hard time believing that more people like Cassandra Clare's The Mortal Instruments series than The Infernal Devices (the first book of which is Clockwork Angel). The writing in the ID series is so much more eloquent than that in TMI (which may be due to the different era), and the characters are so much more likable. The mystery is even greater, and more surprises were thrown my way in ID. And plus, the covers are so much prettier. Yes, I believe that the Infernal Devices series is ten times better than the TMI series. Tessa Gray, the protagonist, is definitely not a Mary Sue; she has a strange ability to change into other people. And no, she isn't like a regular shapeshifter; she not only changes her appearance, but she can access the memories and thoughts of the person into whom she changes. In addition to her supernatural powers, she's an avid reader. (Bonus points for us bookworms, eh?) She may not be kick-butt, but she's got cool points. Don't get me started on the love triangle. Will Herondale may be the hot, sensitive guy with hidden feelings, but he treats Tessa rudely and pushes her away. But Jem Carstairs, Will's parabatai, is sweet and kind, showing Tessa his feelings through his actions. Trust me, this is one love triangle that will make you pull out your hair and scream in frustration-because both Shadowhunters are so lovable. And while there may be romance, that isn't the main plot. (Thank goodness for that.) Planning to visit her brother, Nate, Tessa travels from America to England, where she gets kidnapped by the Dark Sisters who want to use Tessa's power for a mysterious person named the Magister. Then she is rescued by Will and Jem, who take her to the London Institute. But the Magister wants Tessa, and he'd be willing to do anything to get her back... If I could sing the praises of this book even further, I would. C'mon, it's a mixture of fantasy (the vampires, the werewolves, the faeries, the Nephilim!) and steampunk (clockwork army for the win, yo) set in the Victorian era. You've got to try that out. Especially since I'm saying this: Clockwork Angel is phenomenal. Read it now. Source: Hardcover borrowed from library",Linda
9781416975861,"I have heard so many people getting excited over the upcoming release of Clockwork Prince, and i heard that it was the second book of The Infernal Devices. So i just HAD to get my hands on the first book, which is Clockwork Angel. Now i finally understand what all that fuss about Clockwork Prince is about, because i just cant WAIT to start reading it too. Clockwork Angel was a-ma-zing. I loved it so much! The characters were brilliant, and i found no one annoying. I loved how everything was in this book. Vampires, warlocks, demons, you name it. Tessa never annoyed me at first, and she never did annoy me at any point. I imagined her as a petit, quiet girl, but was also very strong. How she would do anything for her brother touched me. I loved the fights that happened, when they would start, i would just read and read and read because it was so exciting! After i read a page, and i wanted to stop at it, i couldnt, because id be eager as to what would happen in the next page. *sigh* Will and Jem. Ah how i would love these 2 boys to appear infront of me right now. Jem's haaaaiirrrr. I LOVE HIM! I might actually say that i liked Jem a bit more than Will, because Will's attitude frustrated me at first, but i still love him too. Actually i might like Will more. UGH i cannot decide. How can someone NOT love these amazing, beautiful, strong boys? It still frustrates me that i do not know much about Will, and how everything about him is so secretive, but i guess thats why there is another book right? Tessa & Will, or Tessa & Jem? I have finished the book, and yet i do not know if Will truly does love Tessa, or vice versa. I dont even know if Jem likes her either, i mean, he did show signs and stuff, but i neeed prooooof! Hehe. Anyways overall, it was an amazing story. So entertaining, very fun and exciting! Honestly if i saw that cover in a library, i would have never picked it up. But im GLAD i read this book! Happy Reading",Juhina & Farah
9781416975861,"I literally just finished the book. I wanted to write the review when is still fresh in my mind. To start with the environment i felt in love with it. It's one of the best settings i have read. When i was reading i was in London at 1878. I've never been there but the whole city, the atmosphere was ""designed"" in mind perfectly. With every little detail. There are not few times when you read a book and the description of the world of the book is either too detailed or not good detailed at all. As a result you start make your own parts of the world to fit the story. This can't happen in Clockwork Angel. Cassandra has build an amazing time machine for you to travel back in time. And that's coming for someone who hates most of the stories written in our world. To put it against TMI*, i liked it more. Its aura is more dark, mysterious and adventurous. And even the story is more interesting for me. As for the characters what can you say? My favourite one was Henry. He has a B' role in the book, maybe even C', but he is the one who stand out for me. His personality, his naivety, the way others was acting against him. I believe he would be easily my best friend. For our main character Tessa i can't say many. I really admire how Clare build her female characters. They feel real. To concentrate on Tessa i was quite fond of her. I don't like her more than Clary, at TMI, but i still like to read about her story. The thing that i disliked most about her, it was that sometimes i felt like she was caring only for her brother and nothing else. Even if she is not selfish in some scenes looked pretty selfish to me. The back up girls,Sophie,Jess and the Dark Sisters were all really different than Tessa. I didn't really cared about what Sophie was doing and i hated Jess (as personality not as her part in the book). The Dark Sisters..well they are ""bad"" guys. I have to admit they scared my a lot. Then we have the boys. Magnus..is Magnus. Everyone who knows is from TMI, can understand what i mean. Even though we see a more sensitive part of him. Will and Jem. I love them! They are so different than each other and they are like brothers. Best friends. I like reading about their relationship and i really want to know more. Will, the guy who likes to be looked as bad(reminds of Jace) and Jem( aka James),the gentleman. If Tessa pick one of them i don't really care who the one will be. I like both for different reasons and both can be at her side. Can't really pick between them. Lastly, for the ones that have read TMI and have good memory they will grin in many scenes were the characters say profitable things for TMI. The connection is really good. I'm really into this book. And i say try it. Even it's the first one of Clare or you have read or either you are fan of TMI. After this 4th book Cassandra Clare became my 2nd favourite writer ever! Stories unique, with no repeating, that you can't see where they really go, with a perfectly shaped world always worth your time. It's not easy to find them anymore.

This is a graphic adaptation of the novel of the same name and even though this is the first in the series I think it will be most enjoyed by those who have read the book. As a standalone, without knowledge of the book, the graphic novel isn't really that exciting of a story. It's been some years since I read the book and this is the only one in the series I've read, and I haven't seen the movie, so my mind wasn't fresh on the events but I do remember more happening that what happened in the graphic novel. For example, I specifically remembered a scene in the book with Medusa, which never occurred in this adaptation. It felt like explanations were missing and gaps were left in the flow of the story. I'm not that crazy with the artwork either; the faces have unnatural expressions. Overall, it's still the same story, so not a bad read, but I'm not overly impressed with this graphic adaptation.",Nicola Mansfield
9780140366501,"Haroun and the Sea of Stories is Salman Rushdie's fifth fiction book, and his first children's novel. He dedicated this book to his 10-year-old son Zafar, from whom he had been separated for some time. The story concerns Haroun, the son of storyteller, Rashid Khalifa. Rashid is described as the Ocean of Notions, the Shah of Blah. When a tragic event stops the flow of his father's stories, Haroun sets out to rectify the situation. In a journey that involves mechanical birds and blue-bearded Water Genies, Plentimaw Fish and Floating Gardeners, a King, Prince and Princess, Pages and Shadow Warriors, heroes and nasty villains, Haroun is faced with numerous challenges and learns much. This is a charming children's story that has much to offer adults. As an allegorical tale, it appears to comment on bureaucracy: ""...a skinny, scrawny, snivelling, drivelling, mingy, stingy, measly, weaselly clerk....""; and ""....P2C2E, a Process Too Complicated To Explain..."". Coming not long after the publication of The Satanic Verses and the ensuing fatwa, it comments, too, on freedom of speech, independent thought and imagination, and censorship. Finally, it is a story about the love between a father and son, this being reflected in the dedication to Zafar. There are poems and puns to bring a smile to the lips; wordplay and pleasing repetitions that will have readers of every age chuckling. Delightful allusions to works as varied as Alice in Wonderland, The Beatles' songs and the Tales of a Thousand and One nights abound. I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it more than any other Rushdie book I have read so far, and I look forward to his next children's book, Luka and the Fire of Life.",Marianne Vincent

Yes there was mystery, romance, angels etc, but the characters (personally I think) are freakishly pretentious.

9781847386960,"I mostly read positive reviews about Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick and I waited quite a while for the German release of this novel. I've got no idea when it happed, but over the last year I have become a huge fan of angel novels. So after I had my wisdom tooth operation, Hush, Hush came miraculously flying to my bed as a consolation. Nora, our heroine is a kind character, unfortunately she doesn't stick out. It wasn't my best connection to a main protagonist, but it was okay. Patch is the total opposite of Nora. He is a real bad boy, playing games all the time, always trying to attract and provoke. Patch's intentions are ambivalent, his personality appears almost schizophrenic to me, which could be really interesting for a further character development but sometimes just scared me. On the one hand he is on a mission to destroy her but then he seems to be in love with her at the same time. His character confused me and never appeared as likeable as Nora sees him or wants him to be. Although it says opposites attract, I cannot think of Nora and Patch as an adorable couple. I am always in need for a good mix of emotions, going from romantic to passionate. It's said that both fall in love, but it doesn't convince me. In my opinion there are too little signs of emotion and too many secrets hidden to keep that relationship working. Secondary characters like a best friend or two male students, who are usually applied to enrich the story and actions, only annoyed me. My thoughts always circled around the relationship between Nora and Patch because other characters weren't diverting enough to catch my further attention. What I really appreciate about Hush, Hush, is the complex web of thoughts that Fitzpatrick seems to spin around the whole love story. Mission-like flashbacks guarantee a deeper sight into the events and the reasons behind them. Past and present are interwoven and only make sense in combination. I rushed through this novel, experiencing high-class bad boy action. Still I have some issues with Hush, Hush that eat up the bad boy bonus and make me give it an only average rating. THE VERDICT Hush, Hush is another novel about angels, the fallen and how their destinies are interwoven with and depend on the actions and life of a single human. I am still going to read the sequel to find out what developments Fitzpatrick has planned for their characters and how she intends to solve certain conflicts.",MissPageTurner

From the first pages of Hush, Hush i was compelled! i mean, really, it's been a long time since i read a book and actually couldn't know what was going to happen next!! Everytime, i was 'wtf?!'.

I read twice ,2nd may 2010 and 3rd May 2010. Refreshing a male lead character , Patch, who was flawed in so many ways but underneath was good. I can't look at Taco making the same way ever again. I loved the 'POW's'!!! I call a POW where the reader is blind sided, didn't see it coming. Patch was a difficult character, full of secrets, mysterious, sexy and ultimately the saviour but no doubt also has his dark terrible secrets. I just loved Patch and his personality, he just oozes it. He is a combination bad guy/good guy . At one stage I was yelling ''NOOOOOOOOOO!!!'' ,when I discovered Patch's motive. It was refreshing to have interesting names in this book. Nora the female lead, Vee her best friend albeit you have to wonder sometimes about the title 'best friend'. I thought Nora's mum was a bit , ""daft"" through out this book , considering. I love a good POW!!! and I think there is a great POW!! in this book. Becca Fitzpatrick has the reader ''brainwashed'' in this tale of a fallen, 'uber smexi' angel and a girl. The book cover is a draw card...love the cover..it tells alot before you open the book.

I was staring straight ahead. When he didn't answer, I turned sideways. ""Soap. Shampoo. Hot water."" ""Naked. I know the drill."" ""You possess other people's...bodies."" He accepted that statement with a nod. Do you want to possess my body?"" I want to do a lot of things to your body, but that's not one of them.""

9780142415573,"Though I was already excited to begin this novel, that excitement was further hyped by all the comments left by other readers on my blog about how much I would enjoy this. It is clear by my star rating that I loved it. I don't give out 5 stars often, but this book took me on a 2 hour roller coaster ride. I didn't eat, drink or think of basic bodily functions the morning I began to read this (probably more information than you need to know but very indicative of how insanely engaging this story was). Two hours is a record reading time frame, even for someone that can read as much and as fast as I do. Why was this so enthralling? These girls are damaged. Damaged in a horrible way. To deprive their bodies of the necessary fuel to survive and function. And what is more saddening, is how they can effectively battle their own brains and basic instincts of survival to provide that necessary sustenance. I can't even fathom such an existence. Or how someone can rationalize inflicting such damage on themselves. And yet, this type of behavior is, sadly, not that rare in a society that holds being skinny in such high regards. It's hard to believe people go through such extents to reach these goals, but I imagine that what this novel described is not far off the mark for the extreme cases. What was most difficult and interesting for me as a reader, was to be given access to the inner most thoughts of a young girl, and she goes through life, day by day, counting calories, fighting with her hunger, or inflicting pain on herself as punishment or release of inner pain. Not to mention one of the most unhealthy friendships I have ever encountered in YA contemporary fiction, where even in and after death, Cassie can affect Lia's decisions so detrimentally. Whether only in Lia's mind, or through some supernatural means, it was still heartbreaking to read. For such a young girl to be so urgently pulled towards death, when there is so much life left to live... it really brought tears to my eyes. It was an insane, mad finish to the conclusion in the hopes that Lia could, in some way, find her way out of the mad world she lived in. That she could somehow find enough strength to reach out for help to get herself out of the complicated world she trapped herself in, before it was too late for her too. This was an incredible novel with very intense subject matter. Though I found it disturbing, it was no less a phenomenal story that I would never hesitate to recommend to young and older adults alike. It will leave its mark on you.",Lily

Her parents think that she is getting better, but she is just fooling everyone. When Cassie, who used to be her best friend, dies, Lia spirals out of control again. She eats less and less and begins seeing Cassie's ghost everywhere. WINTERGIRLS explores the world of eating disorders with vivid, horrifying detail. Even though this book was really creepy, it was also spectacular. I had never understood how or why some people began to have eating disorders, and this book gave a spectacular insight into their state of mind.",TeensReadToo

9781423157373,"The darkest minds tells the tragic story of a virus that's killing children and destroying families. The children that are not killed by the virus are still ruined by it. The virus gives the surviving children disastrous powers which can be fatal in the wrong hands. The main character Ruby's life is turned upside down by one simple loving action that changes everything and leaves her with nothing. The story follows Ruby as she is sent to a 'rehabilitation camp', well this is what it is advertised as, little does Ruby know life just got even worse the moment she steps onto the camp grounds. From the first day at camp Ruby has a secret and the only way Ruby can survive is by keeping it hidden, but when her secret is suspected she must escape and once she's out of camp she must be cautious with who she trusts. The story grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go. I thoroughly enjoyed the immense amount of action that kept me wanting more, there's twists throughout the story that keep you on your toes in suspense. The character development was amazing in both Ruby and the side characters, we see romance blossom and friendships made, we see goodies turn baddies and much more, so much so that every chapter you will have a new question that will keep you reading to get the answers. I lost so much sleep reading this book but it was worth every minute. I would recommend this to everyone as there is something for all book lovers to enjoy throughout the story. I loved this book so much I had to restrain myself from diving head first into the second book, but trust me I will be reading it soon:) I hope this review has helped you, can you please rate it positively if you liked it as it really means a lot to me, Many Thanks for reading:)",Sarah Martin
9781423157373,"Februrary turned out to be a really good reading month for me when it came to reading. I read quite a few amazing books last month and The Darkest Minds was on of them. In fact out of the whole month this was my absolute favourite read. I had had this one on my TBR list since March of 2012 so it was great to finally get my hands on a copy and start reading. I thought that Alexandra Bracken's sophomore young adult novel was an awesome showcase of her talent. I expected this to be the usual dystopian read where the girl has strange powers blah, blah, blah. But I was completely taken by surprise. Instead of the whiney, angsty novel I was expecting I was taken on a fast paced adventure ride. I absolutely loved the story of Ruby. As a character she is near the top of my favourite young adult heroines. She's smart, funny, awkward, and willing to do anything she can to keep her new friends including her love interest Liam safe even if it means making the reader (me) scream at her in frustration at the end of the book. If you've read the book you'll know what I'm referring to. Anyways, back to Ruby. I loved the fact that she struggled with her ability throughout the entirety of the novel. She didn't go from being awkward to a super confident stuck up girl like many characters do after they experience life changing moments which I really appreciated because no one likes a perfect character. The other characters were great too. Even the bad guys. I really liked getting to know Zu, and Chubs. They were both interesting characters though Chubs always seemed to make me laugh at his snarky remarks. Liam though takes the cake when it comes to side characters and love interests though. He's the good guy which I love seeing in young adult noels because I find that the ""bad boy"" love interest thing is way too over done. I loved how protective he was of Ruby and anyone else who needed his help. The story line was interesting. I liked that it centered around a disease that killed off the majority of Children but left those that remained with certain abilities. Plus the whole segregation of the kids with these abilities from the general public was interesting. The writing of The Darkest Minds was quite spectacular. It was fast paced and had many plot twists that I loved. The fact that it wasn't a straight forward love story but more of a thriller was great. I loved how the author was able to create such real characters that were perfect in the fact that they were flawed like everyone else. I also liked that this was a bit of a darker, more grown up YA novel because the author wasn't afraid of dropping the F-bomb and other expletives every once in a while. The dialogue between her characters was very well done as well it flowed easily and wasn't robotic or forced. What I loved the most was that the story of The Darkest Minds was able to draw me in for hours at a time and left me saddened at the end of the first book wishing there was a sequel readily available for me to read immediately. I'm completely and utterly enthralled with Ruby's story and I really can't wait to see what happens in the sequel when it's released. For me this is probably one of the best YA books I've ever read and I'm so glad I read it when I did. I would recommend this novel to anyone who loves YA novels. There's a bit of romance, a lot of betrayal, violence and will keep you wanting to read into the wee hours of the night. Alexandra Bracken gives a likable female heroine that readers can invest in and one who they'll cheer for.",Kimberly Roy
9781423157373,"Let the fangirling commence. Oh my goodness, what a story. I loved it from the first word to the last emotional scene. Alexandra has created a story with a unique plot, amazing characters, and she is one heck of a writer. I couldn't believe the emotional roller coaster that she took me on and this masterpiece that she wrote with the OMG moments, did she seriously just do that to this character that I love, she made me laugh, want to cry, want to rip people's hair out, and mostly just sit in awe of how beautifully she crafted The Darkest Minds. I loved the premise from the moment that I read it, and Alexandra really pulls it off well. She breathed her own breath of fresh air into the genre and wrote some awesome ideas and scary elements to the chilling world she has created in The Darkest Minds. The plot was woven together wonderfully. Alexandra told us what we needed to know at the moment and then filled in the details later by showing them and acting them out. While I admit I was a bit confused with some of the lingo and exactly what happened (I thought I missed something), I later saw how she put it all together. Ruby is an amazing main character. I loved how much she grew and changed in this story, and I really admire the person she turned into at the end even more so than the one that I connected with at the beginning. I love her fighter spirit and how much she cares for and would do anything for the people that she loves. There is also a great cast of secondary characters. Liam, so crushworthy and such a born leader. Speaking of, I admired how the romance in here was subtle, ie no insta love. I appreciated how they got to know each other, and even though there was physical attraction, there was also an emotional connection. On to the others though. Chubs, ever loyal to those he cares about, and full of surprises. Zu, the precious and strong younger character that you want to shield and hope the best for. And then there were the characters like Clancy that I never knew what exactly to make of. There are also some awesomely written antagonists, that make me want to scream at them and wonder at their methods and how they sleep at night. All that said, I must warn that this is a dark book for mature teens. There's some (not on every page or anything though) cursing that I found slightly offensive, but given what was going on, I could overlook. There is also some fairly descriptive talk about injuries/blood. (All of this is in arc the advanced reader copy) Back to what I loved-- I so can't wait to get the next book in this series, and find out more about what happens to Ruby and what comes of the incredibly brave but heart wrenching choices that she made. Bottom line: Absolutely loved and recommend. Wonderful start to a new trilogy. Awesome quote: She didn't know there were two of me now; split between everything I had wanted and everything I would now have to be. One of me... would stay... (The other) thin as a wisp of air and had struggled so long just to be.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781853261077,"Reading The railway children was something I've been wanting to do for a while as my auntie always talks so well of the film. I have never watched the film and I wanted to read the book before I did. This book was interesting as it was done from the point of view of the three siblings, which not many classic books are told from the aspect of a child or children. I didn't find the overall story Particularly interesting, but the one thing that kept me going back to finish the book was the big question Why and Where was their Father taken?. There is many adventures in the story that the children get up to involving the railway track and station as well as other areas, and it's great to see how imagination really was a work of art before technology came into place that children use so much nowadays. The story also goes on to show how big life changes affect children and how well children adapt to things, such as moving home and settling into new surroundings and integrating with their new community. Which many adults find especially hard to do. The characters experience great growth during the story as they go through different challenges and assist with crisis and injury as well as building new friendships and creating fond memories. Overall I would say it was a different book to I'm used to reading but that's why I chose to push myself to read it. I would recommend to those who enjoy these sorts of books but personally it wasn't my type of read. I hope this review helps you, please rate it, it really means a lot. Thanks for reading:)",Sarah Martin
9781620610114,"Favourite Quote: ""Words are the most powerful tool and so often underestimated. They could heal. They could destroy."" After how good the first book (Obsidian) was I was worried Onyx wouldn't live up to its standards but I was so wrong onyx was AMAZING! Let's start with Damien who has changed quite a bit since the first book, he's not as mean to Katy and he's more kind and caring but of course it's Damien and he is still bad-ass and sarcastic most of the time but I still love him because seriously you can't not love him! Then there's Katy who's character development is seriously brilliant throughout this book she became kick-ass and dependant and brave. And these two together. Sexy and Awesome. Only way to describe it. Other characters, Dee I was heart broken for at the end (read to find out why) she is just so innocent I cant believe the author did this to her but I'll excited to see if anything changes in Dee like if she becomes darker or meaner. The new character Blake I didn't like from the beginning because I knew he was involved in the plot in a bad way and plus he was intruding on Damien and Katy's relationship and that made me dislike him even more. Onto the plot which was very well thought out and developed but I did guessed most of the twists, one of which I knew was going to happen way back in the first book but this didn't make me any less excited to see how Jennifer L.Armentrout laid them out and she didn't disappoint! Along with these plot twists there were numerous action scenes that were great and the ending leaving on a complete cliff-hanger, seriously cannot wait until Opal is out. Overall I'd HIGHLY recommend this series, there's nothing but good things to say about it, it's that good.",brookexx
9781620610114,"Following the ""AMAZINGNESS"" of Obsidian, I wasn't sure if Ms. Armentrout could possibly outdo herself. I mean, Obsidian was one of those books that is LIFE-CHANGING!!! Seriously, she did it. She, unbelievably, miraculously, did IT!! Onyx picks up right where Obsidian left off. With a newly connected Daemon and Kat. Daemon, being his extrememly tantalizing self, is stuck trying to convince his ""Kitten"" that they are meant to be. But, Kat is just not having it. Convinced that their attraction is a by-product of their Halloween connection, she refuses to give in to Daemon's, very alluring, wiles...Well, MOST of the time she does. Kat doesn't just have Daemon's persistence to contend with...There's also the DOD--the branch of the government that monitors the Luxen and their activities. Kat starts to worry about the DOD finding out about their connection, among other new ""occurances"". My FAVORITE aspect to Onyx is that we get a Daemon that we didn't really get in Obsidian. He's sweet and not just the jerk that Kat's used to. This makes their attraction all the more intense. If you haven't read this series so far, I honestly don't know what is stopping you. The story has kept me hooked the entire time and I'm absolutely ANXIOUS for more!",Christy @ Captivated Reading
9781620610114,"Well, here I am again trying to figure out what I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. Hands down, it is as amazing as all the reviews have claimed it is. Daemon Black.....just his name makes be swoon. He has to be one of the hottest characters EVER written in a book series. I am dying to see this series made into a movie, but OMG, who in the world could play him and do him justice? Onyx picks up where Obsidian left off. If you have not read Obsidian and Shadows, you definitely need to read both of these books before Onyx. The Lux series is like tasting fine wine, a completely sensory experience. You have to hold it up to the light, swirl it around in the glass, smell it, taste it, and savor it. I am a total Jennifer L. Armentrout fangirl, so forgive me if I gush, but I know there are a ton of fellow fangirls gushing with me. Daemon has become like a drug to us, our own personal brand of heroin - okay, cheesy, cheesy, slap me, but I couldn't resist.....sorry Edward. If you thought the laptop scene in Obsidian was hot, the sexual tension and chemistry gets even hotter in Onyx. For real. You will not be disappointed. Bless her heart, even though Katy tries to tell herself that the attraction they feel is only because of the connection, her attempts are futile. Try as she may, even she doesn't believe it. Daemon and Katy both have it, and they have it bad. There is also a lot of action and suspense in this series. It's actually really exciting in a nail biting kind of way. We are introduced to some new characters in this book, i.e., ""the new boy"" in the synopsis above, and frankly, I didn't trust him or like him either, and you can believe Daemon doesn't. We also see a lot more interaction with the DOD, and the story and the characters really take on a new level of depth and intrigue in this book, which I really loved. There are twists and turns around every corner and your interest is piqued from beginning to end. I can't say too much more than that without spoiling it, but believe me, it is GOOD. We definitely do get to see another side of Daemon in Onyx. Though still fiercely loyal, protective, and cocky, with an ego the size of Jupiter, we get to see past the surface into the deep waters of Daemon in this book. He is quite the romantic, at least when it comes to Katy. Ah, Katy, you can't help but love her. She is such an awesome heroine herself, and like Daemon, she to is fiercely loyal and protective, minus the ego. Katy and Daemon's relationship sucks you right into the middle of the book with them. Jennifer has such a talent for enabling the reader to actually become part of the story. Her characters are so real, and the interaction between the characters, the pacing of the book, and the story line itself is beyond excellent. Several of the reviews I read talked about a cliffhanger at the end, and there is somewhat, but personally, I was really pleased with the ending. It left me satisfied, yet longing for more, like only an Oreo Blizzard can do. Therefore I dub thee, Jennifer L. Armentrout, Princess of the Pages. She knows how to put the R in Romance, the S in sizzle, and H in HAWT. Trust me when I say, that Onyx and the entire Lux Series is something that you do not want to miss, you know, kind of like you don't want to miss breathing. On a happy note, I am so excited that we don't have to wait that long for Opal. I'm dying to see where the story goes from here.",Ellen Gault
9781620610114,"I truly feel as if I can't say anything in my review that you haven't heard from everyone who has read Onyx. YES! Onyx is as awesome as Obsidian. YES! Daemon is infuriating, awesome, and gorgeous as ever. YES! Onyx lives up to the enormous hype. I feel as if I can't say a lot without giving precious details. If you loved Obsidian, you will be blown away by Onyx. Here's why: Daemon. But it's not what you think. Yes, Daemon is impossibly aggravating, in a ridiculously sexy way. In Onyx, though, a different side of Daemon emerges. I wouldn't say he's softer, exactly, but it is a welcome change to see him not actively trying to push Kat away. Of course, the chemistry between the two is fantastic. Daemon and Kat are continuously drawn to one another, with Kat fighting it as much as possible. But who are we kidding? We all know there isn't a snowball's chance in H-E-L-L that she can resist Daemon for long. But...there's a new guy in town, one who takes a noticeable interest in Kat. Could Daemon have serious competition? As for the plot, there's not a moment's rest in Onyx. The DOD is a continual threat, especially since Daemon and Katy's connection is stronger than ever. The Arum are circling. And it turns out that there may be more to Lux /human bond than ever imagined. Kat learns that no one can be trusted. No one. But is it already too late? Onyx deals one exciting bombshell after another. It's no secret that Armentrout is a fantastic writer. I read Obsidian last fall, but her story and the strong impression she made enabled me to slide easily back into the world. I didn't have to jog my memory for details. I didn't have to do a quick re-read, though that would be fun. There's a reason the Lux series is such a big deal. It's that good and worth every bit of the hype.",Andrea Thompson
9781620610114,"Holy chocolate chip cookies. This book was hot and I could not put it down. Jennifer did not disappoint in this sequel to Obsidian. It is just as action packed loaded with humor, sarcasm, plot twists and our favorite book blogging heroine Katy. It is pretty much leave me alone, I'm reading, or Oh is it seriously 3am? kinda book where the world seems to fall away and I get to experience what Katy is feeling and almost feel like I am a part of this world of smoking hot aliens, dept of defense peeps around every corner, and trying to figure out certain boys who shall not be named. It is so hard to review this without talking about what happened, but let me try. There are so many conflicts going on, I just want for the characters I love to be happy, but I guess what kind of series would it be then? There is conflict with Dee, not only with Adam and what their relationship should be, but also between Dee and Katy. Katy makes some bad decisions, and I just want to smack some sense into her (and so does Daemon for that matter), but I totally understand her motivations behind each of those decisions. And that makes her still a strong and determined main character that I admire. But anyways, one of her bad decisions eats up pretty much all of her time, and leaves some feelings between her and Dee. There is also the DOD peeps, and several other new characters that I had absolutely no idea what to think of. They can seem so harmless and good intentions one second, and then the next I am questioning them and wondering if I am paranoid. The drama between Katy and Daemon is so thick you can cut it with a knife. And I love every second of it. Their bickering, his pen pokes, the sexy moments and the whispered endearments and declarations. I ate it up. It kept me turning the pages just looking for another scene between them, and then left at the very end yearning, wishing the next book was in my hands. And mother of all cliffhangers, really? December can't come fast enough so I know what happens, if revenge is sought, and what exactly they meant about everything changing with mystery character rescued that shall not be named. Jennifer is an amazing author, and I love this series, as well as the Covenant series, and just like I know I will probably love everything she writes.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781620610114,"LOVE: One. Characters. Like with all of Armentrout's other books, the characters came alive in Onyx. At the end of the novel, the readers will become attached with each of the characters that they will empathize with them. The characters went through a lot in this installment. They were battered, bruised, and abused. Emotions and hormones (both human and aliens, if they even have hormones) were flowing out of the pages. Things like trust, betrayal, and sacrifice characterized the story beautifully. Evoking emotions from one's readers is a talent very few writers possess, and Armentrout definitely possesses this talent without a doubt. Two. The story itself. With respect to Armentrout's storytelling prowess, she is able to prove once again that she is a master. The readers will get into the story immediately. Her writing is clear, modern, concise, and direct to the point. None of those unnecessary details that would just make the story confusing. And the plot is so cleverly twisted. Who's who? Who's what? Who? What? When? Where? Why? The suspense in Onyx is deadly. It kills. Three. Humor. Still laugh out loud funny. Witty humor pops out when you least expect it. Just when you are getting so engrossed with the suspense, Daemon or Katy says something that will just crack you up. Four. Daemon. That sweet, sweet Daemon and his big romantic gestures. Who knew? Girls will faint reading about how Daemon woos Katy. THIS is romance. Five. Chemistry. Whereas in obsidian, the chemistry between Katy and Daemon is just below the boiling point, it was scorching in Onyx. Despite that, the two are still figuring out what they are to each other. Add into the mix some sort of ""competition."" Suffice it to say that Daemon is jealous. Can you imagine just how he reacts? Spicy. NO LOVE: The ended with a cliff-hanger. It's not the worst cliffhanger ever, but it still a cliff-hanger. FAVORITE CHARACTER: Daemon is in love! I can already hear the ooohs, aaahs, and other feminine sounds. Daemon is so sweet he actually made me teary-eyed at one point in the story. Beneath that tough, arrogant, and oh so sexy exterior, there is a knight in shining armor, a charming prince that will sweep every girl reader off her feet. Now on to the hot scenes. Fan yourselves girls. Fan yourselves. The hot scenes between Katy and Daemon made me feel nervous... among other things. MUSINGS: Onyx will have girls swooning, sighing, and blushing. But there is more to it than that. There is actually a very good suspenseful story behind the passionate romance between a human and an alien. The suspense in this book will have your heart racing. The drama would make your heart bleed. The unexpected twists will have you screaming profanities. If you thought Obsidian was great, then you will be stunned by Onyx. Jennifer Armentrout outdid herself with this one. I was simply blown away! Onyx is on a completely different level - fabulously, unforgettably intoxicating...",JoAnne Claudio

Some have found the writing to be less than spectacular, but I don't care: I was fine with it. For a so-called ""young adult"" book, it's edgy. It's also a period piece in many ways.

9781416975885,"There are books that leave you heart-warmed, books that leave you weeping, and books that leave you speechless. Clockwork Prince manages to leave you feeling all three. Clare has completely outdone herself. The plot is fast-moving and action-packed, leaving you unable to put the book down, as each chapter leaves you wanting more. But it's also deliciously slow and deliberate when it comes to developing Tessa's feelings for both Will and Jem. There are twists and turns that leave your head spinning, and characters that begin to feel more like friends and family, then just words on paper. Tessa is a shining beacon of hope for YA heroines, and what they should strive to be. She is independent and strong and courageous - but she also shows how that doesn't mean she has to be without feelings. She feels everything with such intensity that it's impossible not to feel the same things with her. She's not afraid to speak up, whether on behalf of her own heart or on behalf of those she cares about. She enters dangerous situations without fear or hesitation, as she knows she is needed and that to do anything less would be cowardly. Yet she's still relatable, as she shares with us her insecurities about her status as a Downworlder and her confused feelings for Will who can be so tenderly cruel, and her confused feelings for her good friend, Jem. The ease with which Clare is able to write Tessa, Will and Jem's love triangle is awe-inspiring. There was never a moment where I felt that Tessa was making the wrong decision, as my heart ached with her over her feelings for both boys. When she was with Jem, I could feel her spirit lighten and feel her blush as though it was my own. The comfort they received from each other's presence warmed my heart, and gave me hope that Tessa's love was enough to help keep Jem healthy and strong. But then Will would let his guard down, and show Tessa his true feelings, and she was able to forget about her feelings for Jem in the heat of the passion she feels for Will. And I was ok with it! I understood exactly how she might want to continue to give Will another chance, as his moments of sincerity were so heartfelt that I was left breathless. I won't get in to the details of the plot, as I don't want inadvertently ruin anything. I will say that this is how you write a love triangle, and this is how a cliffhanger ending is properly created and that Clare must be trying to kill us all. I don't know if I will be able to handle the suspense and agony of waiting for a resolution in Clockwork Princess (there will be resolution, right?!)",Pretty Little Reader

They are both awesome, but didn't hold a light to how it was actually reading the book. Clockwork Prince starts where CA left off, and I was not at all disappointed. The plot was awesome-it always had me guessing what would happen next and kept me on the edge of my seat. The way that some things turned out were not at all what I expected-could never have imagined is more like it-I was shocked and pleasantly surprised by some of the developments. Jem really gets his chance to shine in this novel, and I'm really happy for him, even though everything is still overshadowed by his illness. Jem is my favorite for me, but for now, I still have to with-hold judgement on who I think is best for Tessa. Will is really complicated, and we find out some of the reasons for his defenses and it breaks my heart. It feels like one thing gets figured out for him, and then something else stands in his way. But I love getting the glimpses into his heart when we see him interact with Jem--and we get a few of those in CP, and I love every moment of it.

9781444011678,"The returning heroes As a child I used to love going to the library and reading all the Asterix books they had, he was my favourite better than Tintin and with his friend Obelix they were my heroes as they always beat up the invading Romans. Oh how I have missed you my old friend, but not anymore! With a new writing team, Jean-Yves Ferri and Didier Conrad and they have continued in the tradition of Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. This time, Asterix and Obelix are off to Scotland to fight the Romans and collaborating Picts against the other clans. When a Pict is washed up outside their village all the women fall in love with him and the men folk cannot wait to send him back. Asterix and Obelix take him back to his clan in Scotland so he can find his love and marry her. Along the way there are all the old puns, the old wit and plenty of humour of the slapstick variety. There is plenty of fighting and then Obelix finds his joy at the end when he can fight Romans. This book is an excellent reminder as to why I originally loved the whole Asterix series and it is great to see the book back. For us of an older generation it is a return to form and we should be encouraging people to read this once again. I cannot recommend this fun book highly enough go and buy it for the kids, schools get it on your shelves today!",Paul D

9781423101482,"The book featured some of the same frustrations as The Sea of Monsters - cf. a lot of talking and running around to get to a very quickly-resolved conclusion. The arbitrary limits the gods set on themselves are the only reason for 200 of the book's 312 pages; cut out all of that, have the gods actually being gods, and the story would be finished in just a few pages. At least this was not just a retelling of another episode of Greek mythology with the names changed. (The Sea of Monsters may as well have been The Odyssey.) It drew on established mythology, but applied the series' real premise to it to make it something new and engaging. It was a marked improvement from the second book, and if the trend keeps up I am confident that some of my broader concerns about the series in general will be addressed n the two remaining books.",Adrian J.

Percy Jackson now has his hands full in THE TITAN'S CURSE, the third volume of the series. When he answers an urgent call from his best friend, Grover, at a school in Maine, unexplainable things start happening. Grover has found two more half-bloods, who are siblings, but the assistant principal is a powerful monster in disguise. Grover will never get the half-bloods to camp without help. Percy, Annabeth, and Thalia set off for Maine to help Grover, but don't realize that they're walking into a trap. Dr. Thorn, the assistant principal, has some tricks up his sleeve. When Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, arrives, things get out of hand. Dr. Thorn falls off a cliff with Annabeth. Artemis goes after her and everyone else returns to Camp Half-Blood. Here, they try to act as normal as possible, but two camper's dreams indicate severe trouble with both Artemis and Annabeth. The Oracle speaks and five campers must find and bring back Artemis before the Winter Solstice. For the first time, Percy remains behind, but not by choice, and not for long. When Percy meets up with the group, the enemies start showing themselves--and the race to reach Artemis and Annabeth alive becomes more crucial. Can Percy save both them before the Winter Solstice? THE TITAN'S CURSE leaves the reader hanging, waiting for several important questions to be answered in the final two books of the series.

9780061431852,"I did not love it right away. I was confused at first. I did not understand the territory wars, the Houses and the main character. But as I read on, I came to know what was so great about this book that a lot of people love. Let me start with the main character: Taylor Markham. She's not easy to like. She's a disturbed teenager with no clear memory of her past. She has major issues about herself and her relationships with the people around her. She's sometimes selfish and aloof. She's ******-up. Big time. I'm even amazed at the fact the kids in her House worries about and still looks up at her even though she treats them with indifference bordering on neglect. But if there are a few things I like about her, they're her determination to find answers herself and her sense of independence. The other characters are okay. I like Raffaela's concern for Taylor. She's a faithful and reliable friend, one Taylor needs so badly. She puts up with Taylor's crap and remains beside her all the way. Ben Cassidy's my favorite character. He's funny and kind. I think half the time that I laughed while reading Jellicoe Road was because of Ben's witty comebacks. I also love his banter with Jonah every time he makes him jealous. Santangelo is somewhat frustrating. The tension between him and Raffy is so palpable that I don't understand why they're not together. And Jonah. Jonah freaking Griggs. He's not your typical swoon-worthy YA bad boy. But I also love his character, his complication, the way he cares for Taylor, his angst. I find their relationship cute even when they're so close to killing each other that I can't help grinning stupidly on mushy scenes. *wink* And now, the story. I like the way Marchetta wrote this book. The build-up of suspense, the way and timing she threw things at me, the quirky dialogue, the connection between the past and the present that's so essential to the story. Reading this book is an emotional roller-coaster for me. One moment I was crying then the next I was laughing. It was heart-wrenching. I felt the characters' sadness, grief and regrets. I cried when Fitz told Jude what happened to Webb. I cried when Tate read to Narnie to keep her alive. I cried when Taylor discovered her link to the past. I cried when Narnie told the reason why she couldn't move inside the car that night. I cried at the revelations. There were a lot of ""I knew it!"" moments and pleasant - and sometimes unpleasant - surprises. It's like everything and everyone's entangled in a huge web of mysteries and secrets. Jellicoe Road is not a happy book. It's a story about friendship, love, loss, redemption, forgiveness and salvation. Fitz saved Narnie and Webb and Tate. Narnie saved Webb from further heartbreak. Jude saved Narnie and Taylor and Jonah. Jonah and Taylor saved each other. And at the end, Webb saved Fitz from his guilt. You know how when sometimes you wish things happened differently because that way, life would have been happier? I wish Fitz did not come back for the fifth tin that day. I wish Tate was stronger. I wish Taylor's mother did not leave her. But then, the story would have been different, right? It wouldn't be the one that I love, so even though it broke my heart, I'm happy Melina Marchetta wrote Jellicoe Road the way it is. FAVORITE LINES ""Any pain inflicted on Richard warms my heart and it warms yours as well. Go on, admit it. When he hit the ground and the blood went flying and you knew in your heart his nose was broken, didn't you just want to jump for joy and stomp on his ugly face?"" *** This is what I know. I look like my father. My father disappeared when he was seventeen years old. Hannah once told me that there is something unnatural about being older than your father ever got to be. When you can say that at the age of seventeen, it's a different kind of devastating. *** ""You should be worried,"" Ben says. ""Because you're going out with that chick and Raff will go out with some guy and you'll spend the whole time with this 'thing' hovering between you and then you'll get married to other people and one day when you're middle-aged in your thirties, while both your kids are going to the same school, you're going to have this affair because of all the pent-up attraction and ruin the lives of everyone in the P and F.""

9780061431852,"the beginning of this book can be a little bit confusing because it mixes two stories (present and past) that seem disconnected; but that's just part of the wonder. the stories of the characters are very hard, but it is also full of hope. it is also full of magic and intense feelings and passion. i recommend it to everyone who has feelings, who has a soul. i also recommend the other book of Marchetta, but this is my favourite. este es un libro fant!stico, maravilloso. s3lo puedo decir cosas buenas de Â©ï¸l. est! lleno de sentimientos, de pasi3n, de amor, amistad, y de esperanza. los hechos que narran son terribles, pero a la vez hay un rayo de esperanza, una luz que inunda la oscuridad. te enamoras de los personajes, los admiras, te inspiran ternura, los comprendes, te identificas con ellos, lloras con ellos, te res... es un libro recomendable para todo aquel que tenga alma y coraz3n. al principio puede ser un poco confuso, pero luego todas las piezas van encajando como en puzle precioso. melina marchetta es fant!stica. todos sus libros son dignos de lectura, pero este, para m, es el mejor.",julia
9780061431852,"Taylor Markam was abandoned by her mother at a 7-Eleven on Jellicoe Road when she was a mere eleven years old. Only moments later a woman by the name of Hannah picked her up and brought her to the Jellicoe School. Now she is seventeen and finds that Hannah is a rock in her inconsistent life. While she has Hannah, Taylor doesn't know much about her family except the horror stories she remembers of her mother. She does find comfort, though, in a manuscript that Hannah has written about a group of five friends who met in the worst circumstances, but developed a remarkable friendship when they only had each other. When Hannah just up and leaves, Taylor doesn't understand what has happened and she becomes a wreck. Not only does she have to deal with Hannah's disappearance, but she has just been named the head of her House and the leader of the school kids in the annual territory wars against the ""Townies"" and ""Cadets."" In the war, the three groups battle and negotiate, following an extensive set of rules that might as well be history. As the war wages on, Taylor learns to take an active role in her community, as well as develop relationships that she never thought possible. Especially with Jonah Griggs, the leader of the Cadets, whom she already has quite a history with. This war will be like no other. It will not only be between the normal three parties, but among friends, hearts desires, and, most of all, Taylor herself. From the title I was expecting a light and fun read. Wow, was I wrong! This book is filled with heartbreak, joy, laughter, and sorrow. It completely blew me away and surpassed every expectation I had, even though I was expecting something completely different. Before I even get into the elements of the story I have to comment on how much talent the author has. Melina Marhetta's writing style is indescribable. It seemed that she was so comfortable writing the story and her words just flowed from page to page with great clarity. I loved how the author weaved many intricate details and mini-stories into one big story, making it like a puzzle that slowly comes together until those last couple of pieces just fall into place. The only miff I had with this book is that it took me probably until the third chapter to actually understand what was going on. In the beginning, there were two stories and it was hard to wrap my head around everything that was happening. After that, though, it seemed the author settled into writing and the story took off. Taylor, without a doubt, is one of the best characters that I think has ever been created. She has this true voice where you can hear and feel her emotions ring out. By the time the book had ended I felt like I knew Taylor like I know my best friends. While Taylor was the main character, the author did a fabulous job creating the other characters, too. Unlike many supporting characters in books, the characters in JELLICOE ROAD all had their own voices and became their own people, with real and likable personalities. I highly recommend this book to readers everywhere. Whether you're a girl or a guy, you will treasure this novel and hold it near and dear to your heart for a long time to come. JELLICOE ROAD is a beautiful love story, a heart-wrenching story of loss, a poignant self-discovery, and, most of all, an unforgettable tale. Pre-order this book NOW!! It hits stores August 26 and you don't want to miss out on this one-of-a-kind novel. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780141346151,"There are about equal parts of this book that I enjoyed and that I hated. At times I felt the plot was a little dry and lifeless. There were points where I was actually fairly bored. But then the last third or so of the book really picked up and redeemed the book as a whole. I really loved Cleo's character. She was most definitely my favourite of the bunch. I thought she was well-rounded and complex. I loved Jonas' character too. He was another very real, human character with great character growth. I liked Magnus in the beginning, but then he turned into the NiceGuyâ„¢ï¸ from hell. And I'm still on the fence about Lucia. There are points in the book where I really liked her character, but then there were moments where she was such a doormat and painfully gullible. I loved the ending, and to be perfectly honest, it may be the biggest reason why I'll probably continue with this series (and what bumped the book up from a 3 star read to 4 stars).

Once she graduates from St. Vladimir's Academy, she will be assigned to guard her best friend, Lissa, for the rest of her life. Even though everything is going along as planned, she feels waves of jealously and anger. A lot of these feelings come from the fact that she can never have what she truly wants - love. Dimitri, her mentor and teacher, is set to be her partner after graduation. He and Rose will be the team that guards Lissa on a daily basis. The problem is, Rose and Dimitri are in love. Knowing their love isn't allowed, they make sure to keep their relationship professional - when they can. Rose has started seeing ghosts and she feels sure they are trying to tell her something. Soon she begins to understand they are telling her that danger is on the way. Danger that will involve everyone at St. Vladimir's. Rose is no stranger to fighting, but this time it is going to be war. Not everyone survives, and Rose ends up having to make the hardest decision of her life - one that will effect both her and Lissa. SHADOW KISS left me breathless and in tears. I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out. The way the story ends leads me to believe that the next book will be even better.

I have heard a lot of hype surrounding this book and for once I can say, that I completely understand why! It was a really, really good book! A 5/5 stars from me! The best thing about this book for me, was the unique dystopian world that Neal Shusterman created. It was horrific but interesting all at the same time. The world building was steady through-out the book, pieces of information are revealed in each chapter. This was great because it isn't all dumped on you at once and you could understand all the laws and rules of this new world. The plot was good not amazing but I felt all the individual plot lines melted into each other very well. Some of the book was fast-paced with a lot of action scenes, they were written very well! There were a couple of twists that I didn't expect, but for most of the book it was a bit predictable. Neverless I did throughly enjoy it! For once in a book I actually liked all of the main characters! There were all unique and individual, with their own stories that showed the different sides to the dystopian world. Connor was my favourite because he was the flawed hero and I loved everything about him! With Risa I felt we didn't hear enough about her or from her but I still liked what we got! And then there's Len who I hated at the beginning but grew to like towards the end, he's a tormented soul! Overall I cannot wait to see how these characters are dealing with their life changes in the next book!

9781423152880,"Code Name Verity is the sixth novel by British author, Elizabeth Wein. It tells the story of a pair of British women who crash-landed in France during World War Two. The first part is narrated by Queenie aka Scottie aka Eva Seiler aka..., a Special Operations Executive agent, and is written under duress at Gestapo HQ in the town of Ormaie in November 1943. SS Hauptsturmfuhrer Amadeus von Linden has forced from Queenie wireless code for the eleven wireless sets found in the wreck of the plane from which she jumped. What then follows, at his command, is Queenie's account of the course of events that led to their flight to France and incorporates in that her friendship with Maddie Brodatt, the pilot of the downed plane. The second part gives Maddie's version of events, and reveals that perhaps one of the narrators is not entirely reliable. Wein's characters are multi-faceted and realistic: they all have their weaknesses and faults; even the evil ones possess a human side; many are not quite what they first seem. The dialogue, too, is credible and the plot is totally plausible, twists, turns and all. Wein's extensive research is apparent on every page: a wealth of information is secreted in the story in easily digestible form. There is humour, heroism and horror, and enough heartbreak to bring a lump to the throat of even the most cynical reader. This is a tale of friendship and courage that is interesting, informative and ultimately, very moving",Marianne Vincent

9781620610091,"Warning: slight spoilers ahead for Obsidian, Onyx and Opal (Lux #1, #2 and #3) Since I've finished Onyx, the second book in the Lux series, it took a while for me to start the third book. It was not like I expected it to be, and that's what made me curious about what this one had to offer. Everything was left on a rather hectic point in the story. This one, however, was so much better! Though I did have little issues, Opal surprised me in a very good way. The romance has to be one of the best things out of the entire book. The relationship between Katy and Daemon first started off in a unusual way, you can't not admit that. Yet with each book you feel their connection growing, and it has reached perfection. They're finally accepted their love for each other and their passion is there.Their dates and sweet moments are to die for, everyone wants a relationship like that. At least, I do. Oh, I just loved how their relationship developed and all their sweet moments. They're both so caring for each other. The romance showed Daemon's soft side, and I loved it. I love it. I absolutely love it. What I also loved about Onyx was what it did to the characters. Some disappear for a while, as others come back as a whole new addition to the story. This definitely made the plot very interesting. I loved how the book built up to their big mission. It was something that kept me excited and at the edge of my chair, especially when I got closer to the end. I loved how their first attempt falls apart, and even the second one. It proves in what of a situation they're actually in. It's dangerous and full of suspense and mystery. However, talking about their big mission, I feel like something was off about that story line. One moment they're there to fix everything, and a few chapters later they're training again. The training and first try in general fell flat and were a little bit too easy too look over. I can't put my finger on it, I just, I feel like there's something missing with that story line. Talking about other crucial parts of the plot, I don't think there's anything that feels less well done. There's a really good balance between deeper scenes and other, more light-hearted ones. This book always had an amount of suspense, and I loved that. Despite what everyone else thought, I didn't feel like I was missing pages at the end. I don't have mixed feelings, because I thought it was so well done. It left on a perfect climax that doesn't make it impossible to not start Origin, the fourth book in the series, although she left it at a pretty difficult situation. It feels like I can jump right into it, without having that stupid pressure after a book with a cliffhanger. That is something I loved about this book. It opened up a whole new plot for the next book, and I can't wait what Armentrout has in store for her readers. Right now I'm in need to start typing like a crazy fangirl, but I'm just going to keep those feelings to myself and say that the ending was just heart-pounding and crazy. Be warned. Another issue that was noticeable while reading, was the pace. It has always been a little issue I had with this series, and after Onyx I must admit: I was scared for this in Opal. It seems like a pattern throughout the series: first the book starts off at a rather slow pace, but as it progresses it gets better and better until the end where it crushes your heart. This was the case with the previous two, and I'm kind of sad to admit that it was the same with this book. The only difference here was that the pace built up to the so-called climax, to completely fall and to start slow once again. It has always bothered me, and right now I'm crossing my fingers in the hope of a difference with Origin. There are quite a few new characters introduced in this book. An as I said earlier, every character brought along a story line. Looking at the overall crew of new characters, I like them all. They're all unique and have something to add to the story. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of them in the future. The changes in the regular cast, however, are palpable. While Daemon was the most likeable character in Opal, Katy managed to annoy me at times. I'm not all too crazy for her new I don't care, I love it-attitude, because it brings along recklessness, and look at where she is now. I adored a certain death, but was sad about others. With others, I just mean the relationship between Katy and Dee. What happened? I really don't like where this is heading. I didn't like it because the sweet moments between the two just weren't there. At times I was in need of one of their moments, and instead I got a fight with arguments that made no sense. I don't understand why Dee is acting like this. Sure, blame it all on the grieving process, but I needed that girl. Opal was definitely a surprise for me in a really good way. Although my stupid little issues, I did love where it ended, I certainly loved the romance. and I can't wait to pick up the sequel!",Aurelie Cremers
9781620610091,"I finally got my paperback of Opal by Jennifer L. Armentrout from The Book Depository and as always this series did not disappoint. I loved this as much as I loved the first two books in the series. I did want to smack Katy from time to time but hey, there were a lot of Daemon and Dawson so yeah, you get the picture. *nomnomnom* To start with, I don't know if I still like Katy as much as I liked her during the first two novels. Seriously, this just refuses to listen and I just have no idea why. After everything that happened, she still refuses to listen. I don't know why but it kinda' ticked me off a bit. I know I like my female characters to be someone who could actually defend herself but sometimes I think she just has to accept the fact that she hold Daemon back in some ways. So yeah, it's really not that bad to sometimes know when you're just supposed to suck it up and just listen. Anyhoo, I still like their banter and the fact that she's managed to connect with both Daemon and Dawson in some ways. I mean not sexually or whatever with Dawson but in friendly kind of way. And my heart went out to her because of all the guilt that she felt. I still love Katy despite her flaws. And moving on to our yummy alien twins, Daemon and Dawson. These two were just so different it was just so easy to tell them apart. I love them both even if Dawson was just too gloomy for his own good. He did go through a lot of awful things and he just got back so yeah, he's excused. I like both brothers because of their devotion towards their partners. Every time Daemon opened his mouth just made me turn into mush. Seriously, it should be illegal to be that seductive and hot even for a fictional character. Anyhow, also love the fact that Dawson somehow also seemed protective of Katy. Not in the way that Daemon is but like someone who actually cares about his brother's girlfriend or something. I don't know. I just think it's really sweet. I don't even know if it's just me but whatever. Overall, I loved this novel as much as the first two in the series. Daemon still has that effect on the female species I guess. The fact that a fictional character actually made me feel like mush is definitely something. I did miss some characters like Adam and Dee. I think a part of Dee actually died along with Adam. I also love the fact that Matthew seems more open to Katy and Daemon now. He is the closest thing to a father that the Luxen have after all. The return and appearance of certain characters surprised me though. I think this novel is just as enjoyable as Obsidian and Onyx. The cliffhanger ending is such a doozy though. I was like WTF?! Nuuuuuu. That did not just happen! Anyway, it just made me want to read Origins more though. Rating: 4.5/5 stars",kristine leigh marbella

Dawson is so broken, and I can totally understand where Katy and Daemon are coming from wanting to do anything to make things right. I also appreciate the empathy that Katy has for Dawson, and imagining that she would do the exact same thing if not more if it were Daemon. It is also so hard to see the friendship between Katy and Dee so broken. I miss their easy and fun way about them and I hated seeing them not getting along. I also long for them to be able to talk about their love life as well a everything else going on with each other. Though if there is ever any blameless motivation for a broken relationship, Dee and her feelings of loss and that Katy didn't trust her and confide in her, they are founded, though I also understand that Katy was trying to protect her. As usual, Jennifer kept me on the edge of my seat, only guessing at what would come next, and being completely blown away by where she takes the plot. I love these characters, this series, and Jennifer as an author. But oh man, talk about one helluva cliff hanger. Sweet alien babies... I mean, really? You're gonna leave my girl like that? But alas, I shall have to suffer with the other fangirls until the next book comes out. Bottom line: Must read series. Opal is hot, fast paced, with amazing characters.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781620610091,"Opal by Jennifer Armentrout is the third book in the Lux series. If you haven't read any of these books yet you really need to get on that. If sci-fi and aliens aren't your thing, trust me, these aliens will make you change your mind. Daemon Black just keeps getting sweeter and sweeter. He's still a jerk from time to time, but he doesn't do anything to purposefully hurt Kady. Mostly he's just entertaining during his jerky moments. With the return of Dawson comes a whole lot of emotions for Daemon. Dawson isn't how he used to be and Daemon is both happy to have his brother back, but sad that he's not the same brother from before. I really enjoyed the Dawson/Daemon relationship throughout this book. I also loved the way Dawson and Katy got along. The events Katy went through in Onyx played a huge role in Dawson feeling comfortable around her and they were able to form a really nice friendship that was thoroughly amusing at times. Especially when they were around Daemon. Katy was the one character I felt lost some of her original appeal. There was just something missing from her. She was still feisty and hilarious, but there were times when she seemed to take on the plain-girl-who-all-the-boys-love role. Maybe it was because her and Daemon weren't fighting as much (though they did get in a few good ones) or maybe it was because she was so down on herself after the way Onyx ended, but I just felt like there was something off about her. I was so in love with these characters after reading Obsidian. And Onyx was by far one of my favorite books (probably ever). Honestly, Onyx so far exceeded my expectations that I might be judging Opal a little harshly, but it just wasn't as good as I was hoping. Don't get me wrong, it was still really good. It was full of action and romance and Daemon Black! But it was more predictable that Obsidian and Onyx and fell a little flat in comparison. There were also a few things that left me thinking ""What?"", but I'm sure they will all be addressed in the next book. If you're a lover of the Lux series than you'll obviously want to read this one. And you'll probably have so many emotions you'll have screamed at your book more than once by the end. You'll also have laughed and cried too, probably. But, being totally honest, as enjoyable as Opal was, it just didn't have the same spark the first two books did.",Pretty In Fiction
9781620610091,"Favourite Quote: ""Hey, Mom, our neighbours are aliens. One of them accidentally mutated me, and Will is a psycho. Any questions?"" I was so excited to read this book because the last two (Obsidian & Onyx) were awesome but unfortunately I was disappointed in this book. The plot was the biggest things, I felt that nothing major happened until the last 50 pages and before that the plot just keep going round in circles. Though I did still like it, I felt the plot was slower than the previous books and that annoyed me. The ending though I guessed it would happen still ended on a major cliff-hanger which means I cannot wait until the fourth book! One thing I did really like about this book was the character development that took place. Katy completely transformed for the better in my opinion, a very good heroine. Dee's grief was written very realistically and we show a completely different side to her, very dark and angry. Dawson was a very dull character in my opinion, I think the only emotion we saw was at the end of the book so I'm excited to see how the changes in book 4. Surprisingly Ash and Andrew grew on me so now the only character I don't like is Blake for obvious reasons. Overall this was my least favourite book of the series so far but I still highly recommend this series to everyone! I give this book a 3/5!",brookexx

9780805094596,"This book. How do you properly review a book that you love so much that you can find basically no fault in it? I hadn't expected to fall in love with this book as quickly as I did. The characters and the plot just grabbed hold of me and drew me in. They made me love them and want to keep reading despite having to start my shift at work. I found this such a good book that when I finally had my weekend, that I told my parents and everyone around me that they would get into a lot of trouble if they bothered me. The first thing that caught my attention about this book was the cover. The bottom of the cover in particular, purely on the fact that it has what can be considered Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, Russia. One of my ultimate destinations to go and visit and experience is Russia. For years now, I have been wanting to go there and see everything that I can, and learn the language more than I know it already. Then when I started reading the book itself, I learned that this is in an alternate universe with a lot of Russian influence. It takes place in a country torn apart by war called Ravka. I have seen other reviews on goodreads and other places on the internet saying that this is a poor representation of the country. I would just like to point to people that this is not Russia. It merely has Russian influence. There is a big difference. This starts out when Alina Starkov is a little girl and first orphaned because of the war that has been ravaging Ravka for years upon years by this point. She gets her first look at The Grisha a few weeks or so after first getting to the Duke's house. This is where you find out that The Grisha have powers and that they are there to try and see if Alina or her friend Mal have any type of power like they do. Scared of being ripped apart from what she had finally come to think of as home in a sense, she somehow tricks them into thinking that she is merely a normal human girl and not one of the Grisha. Fast forward a bit and you meet Alina and Mal when they're older and serving in the army. This is also where you first meet The Darkling and more Grisha. At the point where you meet The Darkling is where things start to really get interesting, because you finally learn that Alina is in fact a Grisha. The character development in this is surprising to me. I had thought that the book would have taken a different turn than it did. It was surprising how Alina finally found a place where she would belong, where she would fit in finally, only to have the opposite happen. She still felt out of place among those of her kind. The Darkling is by far my favourite character in this book. To me, he represents your typical person hungry for power. He has a soft spot for Alina and his Grisha, but at the same time he is so corrupt and evil and filled to the brim with his own arrogance and plans to overthrow the current government that he feels a need to keep Alina as a slave for his own rise to power because of the type of Grisha that she is. Mal, who in the book is Alina's best friend is not among my favourite's by far. As a character I'm glad that he is in the book because we need someone on Alina's side from start to finish, wanting to see her succeed and be with her. She needs someone there to keep her grounded. As far as love interests go, I am definitely not rooting for Mal. An unsung hero in this book is Baghra. Who later in the book when Alina flees the Little Palace, is the Darkling's mother. She had been doing everything to train Alina to be ready and able to fight and take on the Darkling. The way this is written grabs the writer and makes them want to keep reading and reading. I didn't want to put this book down as soon as I picked it up. I wish I could say something else other than read this book as soon as you get it. It's full of excitement, action, and some of the most interesting characters in a book I've read in a while. This is definitely a five star rating from me.",MegShelley
9780805094596,"I loved this book!! It was one of those reads where after I finished it I couldn't stop thinking about it. The author created an imaginative, magical, and vivid world. It was not a world I'd like to visit though. Alina had it rough through childhood as an orphan in this harsh world. I went on an emotional roller coaster for sure. I love those kind of reads. I don't even know what to say without giving things away. I want you to read this book and discover this world for yourself. It's great! I'll tell you this: I cried tears of joy at one point which doesn't usually happen when I read. It was the sweetest moment. I'll have to choose this book for my book club to read so I can talk all spoilery about how wonderful it was! The ending was great with enough closure to satisfy while leaving more to the story for the next installment. I can't wait to read the next book!!! Is it really a year away?

9780805094596,"It completely makes my day when I discover that there are new fantasy YA books coming out - and then I heard everyone one raving about how amazing Shadow and Bone is, so I had extraordinarily high expectations when I read Leigh Bardugo's debut, Shadow and Bone. And here's the thing: I didn't think it was as awesome as I had hoped, but I think I was also expecting the second coming. While it's not that, it is an particularly noteworthy new release and one of the strongest debuts I've read in a long time. Plus, it features a strikingly rich and incredible fantasy setting unlike other books I've read within the genre. Reasons to Read: 1.A GREAT fantasy setting: You can kinda pick this up from the cover, but Shadow and Bone features a distinctly Russian influence for its setting - which is pretty sweet, if I do say so myself. You can really tell that Leigh drew some of her inspiration from it, which lends to this sort of magical setting that already exists within the book. And it keeps the characters and place just unfamiliar enough for those of us who aren't familiar with Russian language or names. 2.Dark, sexy villainry: I really love it when an author can come up with a really GREAT villain; someone that you both sort of admire and despise, in a twisted sort of way. It's a complex relationship, and I think that's why it's so hard to do. So I treasure these rarities whenever I can find them- but I love it when a villain never seems quite ALL bad or totally evil (kinda like Darth Vader. Completely evil, but we still love him for some reason). Leigh is a master at this. And this is the kind of villain that you can develop a book crush on, easily. 3.Childhood best friends: I'm a sucker for these relationships; I love it when two friends grow up together, and then something happens that tries to keep them apart. It's agonizing! But I always find that I feel such a deeper, stronger connection to the characters and I typically end up more emotionally invested in their story, because of their shared history. Mal and Alina are just too adorable; they fight like an old married couple (which sounds better than brother and sister). 4.A plot to care about: I love that the plot has clear direction and totally owns the story- the plot keeps the story moving along and we don't lose ourselves in side stories or minor characters. Yes, other things are happening- but the focus stays on the Fold and what can be done about that. And the volcra? Yeah, those are FREAKY. I got really excited about this story and it kinda sucks that I'm now twiddling my thumbs waiting for the next book ALREADY. Like I hinted at in the beginning of my review, my only complaint about this one is I think it may be a bit overhyped- yes, I definitely think this is a must-read YA of the year and one of the best books released in 2012. But I still felt like I was expecting TOO much from this one. Perhaps because I love and appreciate a good fantasy so much, I tend to put it up on a pedastal and I'm not sure this one is quite as exciting as I had hoped it would be. But it is utterly magical, with kissing scenes to make you swoon, lovely writing that easily showcases Leigh's talent - why can't we have more books like this one? E-galley received from publisher for my honest review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9780805094596,"Shadow and Bone was like walking through a version of Tolstoy's Russia that was filled with magic. So many little details reminded me of Tolstoy like the mention of saints, troikas, samovars, peasants, and even the names. The world building was incredible with details being revealed naturally throughout the story and even mentioned more than once so you wouldn't get confused. Leigh took a culture from our world and tweaked it just enough to turn it into a rich fantasy world. She's genius, I tell you! The Grisha were a new and interesting mythology that reminded me a little of druids. They were unique and refreshing. They wore beautiful Russian-type robes and they had different classes of magic over certain elements like earth, air, and water. Throughout the book there was such beautiful imagery, like a boat sailing across the sand. The story line was unpredictable and fascinating. The prologue starts out with the main character Alina's childhood which I found very charming. I loved the theme throughout of how powerful knowledge is. There were circumstances that stayed exactly the same, but Alina's new knowledge would change everything. And to top all of that off, there are two very dashing and romantic leads that left me breathless. Do you like dark and mysterious or loyal and charming? I'll have one of each, thanks! This was a new and exhilarating take on high fantasy. It was unlike anything I have ever read before.",Jessica B
9780805094596,"I have to admit right now that I am not a big fan of high fantasy books, my expectations of them are always too high - the world building and characters have to capture me within the first few pages - I need to be able to picture and feel everything as though I am sitting right next the characters... Leigh Bardugo not only delivered but went over and beyond anything I could have ever expected with Shadow and Bone! Her writing and storytelling had me mesmerized right from the start. There were moments that I found myself holding my breath and had to contain myself from skipping ahead! I could not put this book down and ended up reading it all in one night! I feel like no matter what I write right now, it won't do this book any justice... Alina is your average teen girl, really, she's just average. In a world that is ranked by power and beauty, Alina does not fit in anywhere. The only place she ever felt slightly normal was when she was with her childhood best friend, Mal. And now that they're of age and have been enlisted to do their jobs, they have been growing apart... until one day, their regiments are deployed to go through The Fold - a place that no one ever wants to go through - and they are attacked and Mal is seriously injured which causes Alina to unleash her unknown powers to stop it. A power that no on else possess. Which then leads to Alina joining the Royal Court, and must go through training to control her new power. She is thrust into an unknown world, one that she had never thought she would ever be a part of. Even with her power, she feels that she not good enough to be ranked with the beautiful Grisha. And I don't blame her! Everyone always thought of her as average, and she believed it. Wouldn't you have a hard time getting over your past as the 'ugly duckling' that nobody wanted? Mal... I have to say, in the beginning, I didn't like Mal very much. He started off like a typical teen boy, hanging out with his friends, showing off, doing what guys do. But once he was one-on-one with Alina, we finally got to see his true personality, and he shined. Yes, sounds typical, but in real life this is what people do - we sometimes act a bit differently depending who we are with, and most teens are known to do fall for this... and I forgive Mal. He truly lives up to everything you will expect of him, and more. There is no denying that The Darkling is a stunning, quick witted and a mysterious guy. Which of course makes him completely irresistible. Even though I had a bad gut feeling about this guy, I fell for him. Hard. And he broke my heart... and no, I will never forgive him. The Fold. This is the place where nightmares are made. Seriously! I had a dream, errr, nightmare about it. The Fold is a stretch of land that has been voided. There is nothing there but complete darkness and for lack of a better word, death. This is where Bardugo's writing and world building just left me with my mouth hanging open, staring out into space, picturing and feeling exactly what it would feel like to be in that place... it gave me the shivers. If you loved Katsa, Po and Leck from Graceling (by Kristin Cashore), you will also love Alina, Mal and The Darkling. Similar stories, for both are very well written high fantasy books. But so very different in everything else. Shadow and Bone is a must read book!",Margarita Cortina

9780062085610,"Favourite Quote: ""The mind is it's own place, and in itself can make a heaven a hell, a hell of heaven."" I've heard quite a few good things about this book and decided to check it out...and I really liked it! 4/5 stars from me! The was a couple of things that held me back from giving it a full 5/5 stars. First being the main character Anna who was far to na????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????-ve and innocent (I know that's how she's supposed to be, still really irritated me). To me she was not portrayed as a strong heroine, and I felt little connection to her. The other thing that kind of bothered me was the formation of the love triangle! I hate them. Enough Said. Onto the things I did like such as Kaidan. I just loved him, a great example of a bad boy. Cannot wait to read more about him! Other side characters like Jay, Marina, Ginger and Anna's father were all good characters who had different sides to them, I actually felt more connected to them than I did to Anna. The plot was really good, I loved how the author didn't shy away from all the different addictions known in the world, drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex etc. She actually used it for much of the world building and the portrayal of demons. A very unique concept. For me there wasn't much action in the book, it more about the information needed for the reader to understand the world. This didn't bother me at all, I found everything about the angels/demons very interesting and I'm sure in future novels there will be a lot more action. Overall I would recommend this book to everyone even if you don't like angels/demons, this book has a different take on them so give it a try!",brookexx
9780062085610,"SWET EVIL is so forbiddingly well written that I can't imagine anyone ever setting this book aside for more than a few minutes after starting it. Well, I needed to for bathroom and kitchen breaks, but believe me, I would have read straight on from beginning to end if that was possible. Anna is one heroine I could almost 100 % identify with. A very rare occurance. She's the good girl, shy and very emotional about everything. That Anna is one of a kind adds thrill and curiosity to the story. She is angel and demon all at once. Having an angelic mother and a demonic father. Everything's new to her and she has yet to find her destiny and place in life. How evil does she have to be to survive the Dukes constant supervision and how much evil might kill the goodness that makes her the person she is? Kaidan, our male protagonist, is pure dynamite. Erasing every other book boy from my dreams. Well, as the son of Pharzuph he knows how it's done. Ladies, get ready to be expertly seduced! Kaidan Rowe is attractive, sexy and even if he would never admit it, he has a heart and is very capable of using his brain and not only..yeah, you know. The contrast between Anna and Kaidan is enormous at first look. He is the bad boy, having to have as much sex as possible to please his demonic father of lust. Anna is the angelic good girl. You'll see them being together is an explosive combination. Anna will be tested and also Kaidan has to face who he really is. I like how much Wendy Higgins extracts from her characters and gifts to us readers. Her characters are made of awesome! There was one teeny tiny thing that bugged me though. Wendy Higgings incorporated a few German sentences, which I really appreciate. More foreign languages in YA English books, please! But somehow the phrase got mixed up and wasn't translated correctly. I guess it just slipped through the edits. What would SWEET EVIL be wihout the big evil? Wendy Higgins spins a story of sins and acts of kindness. Goodness battleling evil. So there's no way round meeting the various Dukes of sin and all the bad in the world. Quite entertaining I say. Expect to read a lot about inappropriate behaviour, much cussing, cheating, sleeping around etc. There's a list of the Dukes and their offspring at the end of the book, so don't worry if you can't remember all the names and attributes after their first mention. Up until a few days ago Wendy Higgins hadn't been sure if there would be another book in the SWEET EVIL series. The news: Harper signed her for a trilogy. So there will be two more books after SWEET EVIL!! I can hardly contain my excitement. THE VERDICT SWEET EVIL - A seductively delicious treat! This book was so much more than I'd hoped it would be. Kaidan and Anna's connection is sizzling hot. The entire cast is so brazenly charismatic and wonderful. The challenge to ever get that book out of my mind is on! It's a real joy for sinners and a dare for saints! SWEET EVIL makes you want to be both!",MissPageTurner

9780062085610,"Right from the get go Sweet Evil by Wendy Higgins had me on the edge of my seat. It's been awhile since I've had that ""Oh my god! What's gonna happen next? I can't wait for more!"" feeling. Especially right from page one, but Sweet Evil was so fantastic I couldn't not read late into the night. I didn't want to put the book down. Sweet Evil was definitely not what I was expecting. It's like, if The Mortal Instruments and Amy and Roger's Epic Detour had a really hot baby, that baby would be Sweet Evil. It's got all the elements of a truly entertaining read. A strong heroine who doesn't know who she really is, a sexy, sexy bad boy love interest, and an edgy and unique twist on angels and demons. I loved the mythology Higgins built in Sweet Evil. The idea of certain demons being allowed to take possession of human bodies to cause destruction in the human world isn't exactly new, but the way Higgins writes it is original and very entertaining. It's also pretty scary. I think this was my favorite use of Nephilim in a story ever. I loved their history and their roles in demon society. I felt really bad for the Nephilim too (or at least some of them anyway). Anna and Kaidan's relationship was sizzling, right from their very first encounter. Anna is the ultimate good girl, while Kaidan acts like the ultimate bad boy. I feel like throughout this series those roles might waver a little bit. They're both really amazing characters, whether they are together or apart. Anna does get a little stalker-ish from time to time, but it was done in a very realistic way. I imagine more than one girl will look at Anna's behavior and cringe knowing that they acted similar at one time or another. (Hot boys tend to bring out the wacky in us!) And poor Kaidan. You'd think a rock star half-demon would love having a job like ""lust"" (basically sleeping with different girls every night), but watching Kai struggle with his job and his feelings for Anna is painful. I love me a good forbidden love story and Sweet Evil definitely delivers on that front. While their relationship is a big part of the story, it's also about Anna learning her lot in life. Her situation is difficult and pretty unbelievable and I probably wouldn't handle it with half as much grace as Anna does. I thought she was a very relatable character and I can only imagine how awesome she'll be as she grows throughout the series. Sweet Evil was an all around fantastic read that I urge everyone to read. It's a must read for fans of Cassandra Clare. It will hook you from the very first page and not let you go until the very last. And oh that ending! You will be a total wreck until the sequel, Sweet Hope, comes out. Or, at least, I will be!",Pretty In Fiction
9780062085610,"I discover the book one day by accident I must say while I was surfing Goodreads for books and this pop up in front of me. I have a thing I Suppose with Angels and Demons stories and the moment I saw this I just knew I had to read it and pre order it already. Called me crazy but my guts worked fine in the past And I knew I had to to get it to my hands to read. Anna is a 16 years old Southern girl who was always able to see emotions as colors to other people. She always tried to hide it and live with it so that is why She called her self as a weirdo. One night her best friend Jay insist to go to a club so they can promote Jay new songs to a band who was supposed to play there and while they are in the club Anna meets something unusual and something odd to her : She meets Kaidan the drummer of the band and... She notice that Kaidan doesn't have any auras around him and she is totally shocked with it because it's the first time something like her happens to her. Out story begins from here. I finished the book yesterday and over all I can be honest and say that it was very fun to read and I really enjoy it. Anna was a little bit too good and nicely to me but as the story continues we see a lot how she struggle to deal between her inner good and dark side (she thought she didn't had?) and the relevelation of the true identify of their parents and what her role supposed to be. I really liked the other characters too. Jay was hilarious and Patti as an adopted mother was just amazing, you could feel her love towards Anna and how she feel about him. The main triangle is this book is filled with 2 characters : Kaidan and Kopano. At the first half it is all about Kaidan and I mean literally all about Kaidan. Kaidan is the bad boy everyone warn you not to step by. And as always when you hear a warning like this you always go to that direction and Anna was not the exception after all. I really really wanted to like him which I did but I really wanted to slap him and get rid of him with how the behavior and his attitude in all books. There were some moments that you would be able to see his humanity and how he really tries but the thing that really made me off in some parts was his ''work'' .... Kopano in the other hand was introduced to us to the second half of the book. He is really sweet and cute despite his ''work'' or his past. Imagine a male version of Anna and here we have Kopano... Unfortunately there are not so many stuff about Kopano and I am really looking forward to read more about him in the second book. I guess there was a reason. In the other hand there was some tiny flaws that It got my concern like there is a strong religions aspect, maybe because I am not that religious person I don't know, but Wendy created a very interesting story with an equal light and dark side. And speaking of dark side the second half of the book when the main storyline kicks and the Dukes coming into and the War and that stuff is what it made the book awesome in the end. Dear Wendy please You gave me the chills in the end of the book with using Germans commands aka insults... Das war genial.. Over all i cant wait to read the second book!!",Maria Mentzelidi

The problem with this book though is that it didn't really seem necessary for an entire book. Barely anything important in the plot happens and it takes way longer than it should have. It almost seems that this book was just to get you warmed up for the book after it. If more happened in this book it would have been better.

9781619630345,"I'm obsessed with this story and where it's going. The characters, the plot (ugh!), everything--I just love it so much! This world is now one of my favorite high fantasy worlds. The story switches POV a lot and dips into all these different storylines and political agendas, making the world that much more rich. First of all, Celeana is so cool! I love a good badass, arrogant, but broken character. She's so complicated and deliciously wonderful. We get to see tidbits of her tragic backstory and how she came to be this seemingly heartless assassin. Then we've got the whole competition aspect of the story that only gets more complicated when the competition starts getting gruesomely murdered around her. It's a who-done-it story with a twist. Celeana has to train and compete against all these intense scary men. I loved when she stopped trying to hide her awesomeness and took down her sparing partner without even drawing a sword, making him look like a fool. She spits out one of my favorite lines in the book with her boot in his face, ""Here's a lesson for you, weapons master. Give me real men to fight and maybe I'll bother trying."" Can we be friends, Celeana? Right now? Awesome, just don't snap and kill me, please. And then there's Dorian and Chaol. Her relationships with them are so different but cute in their own ways. First of all, there's Dorian (the pompous prince who's slept with half the women in the palace). He might be a little naive and arrogant, but he learns to connects with Celeana over books and wit. He brings her books he's enjoyed so they can talk about it. So cute! And then there's Chaol (my favorite of the two men). He's stuck guarding and trainer her, so he's almost always around her (much to both of their annoyance). To start off, they hate each other. They're snarky and mean in a fun sort of bantering way. Because he's always around, he slowly gets to know and understand the sides of her she doesn't let anyone else see. I could sit here and go through all the wonderful character, but it would be an incredibly long and rambling post. That's the problem (not really a problem) with trying to explain a high fantasy story. There are so many characters, plotlines, and political schemes. Trust me when I say I'm only grazing the surface! I'm so excited to see where this story goes. Sarah J. Maas has only scrapped into the surface of this world. This is the first of six books (the first three of which are already out). There's no rushing this story. Maas is letting it develop and grow in such a beautiful way. It's gonna' be massive with a bunch of different lands, characters, agendas, kingdoms, and let's be honest here, a whole lot of death. If you're a lover of fantasy, you NEED to check out this series. The first book is good (but I've already finished the second and third one) and I can promise that the story and the writing ups itself with every book, becoming more and more epic. This book is good. The next one is great. The third one is fan-friken-tastic! So get reading and catch up...so you can wait the torturing year until the fourth book is released (itcould be longer, since the third book was only released like a month ago).",Ryann Dannelly
9781619630345,"This book. Is amazing. I loved every single page. Celeana, thumbs up, most awesome character EVER. Her history is very interesting and added to the tension between her and basically everyone else. Dorian, the Crown Prince. Well he was hot. Didn't see that one coming. It wasn't until a bit over half way when I changed my opinion about Dorian, originally sharing Celeana and Nehemia's view that he was arrogant to say the least. But after a few cute romantic scenes, and some stunning blue eyes that melt your heart, I couldn't get enough of him. But time and time again I felt that he let her down. He stands up to his father only a couple of times, and at the least helpful times. I'm just like, come on Dorian, pull yourself together and be a man and ACTUALLY help her when she NEEDS help. Not just when she's almost dead. Hence, this made me feel less inclined to be rooting for Dorian and look towards other alternatives. Pah, flirting and snogging just didn't quite pull off as a guise for chivalry. Still, he was smoking. Chaol on the other hand. ;) I felt that for a lot of the book Chaol was there but pushed aside because of Celeana's fascination with flirtatious, and ridiculously good looking prince. And all that time I wanted to give him a hug for being her subtle knight in shining armour, who, unlike Dorian, was there whenever she needed him, despite his heart slowly being pulled to pieces as he was pushed aside. He never gives up on her and their love/hate relationship is absolute gold. The only issue I had with Chaol's character was that I couldn't create him right in my minds eye. That made it hard for me to really get along with the character because I couldn't shake the incorrect image I had forged in my mind's eye, and that obviously kept clashing with what the book was telling me. Nonetheless, he had to be my favourite character aside from Celeana. HERE'S TO TEAM CHAOL! I really thought that without him this book would NOT have been so amazing. Whilst the flirting between Celeana and Dorian was enjoyable, it was cliche and made me feel sad for Dorian because that's not who he wanted to be - but I felt like he would have treated all the other ladies in the court the exact same way if he wasn't so obsessed with Celeana. Poor guy. Chaol and Celeana don't like each other from the beginning, there's more of a tense friendship between them, which makes their progression to ""something more"" wayy more genuine. It's a subtle shift, and not pushed. And damn, that scene with the chalk line - where can I find one of these men. Looking for a few people to really hate? People to sink those fangs of yours into? Let all that angst out? I present to you; Kaltain, a spiteful woman who suffers from frequent headaches, as do most pompous snobs in books. I hate her, and she's annoying, and she's horrible, insufferably clingy and selfish, and did I mention I hate her? Oh but there's more, after her take a good long bite out of Cain, and Perrington (if you dare get close to those smelly beasts). So yeah, let it all out, there's some good hating to be done. And let's not get started with the pure awesomeness of Nehemia. She redefines friendship on so many levels. From the first moments her character and Celeana's just click. The fact that they can both converse together in another languation just makes me want to go, ooh burnnn, to people like Kaltain, as they show her up in some seriously deceitful translation ""mishaps"". They compliment each other through their personalities. She better have a big role to play in Crown of Midnight, or I'll get my pitchfork out and start waving it around in protest. Where's the line for Team Nehemia? I'd like to join, and also buy a t-shirt with some fancy Wyrdmarks on them so I can cheer her on from the sidelines. The creepiness of the Wyrdmarks bring the books to a whole new level. Adding the excitement that was needed to make this book tick all the right boxes: unique setting, wonderful love triangle, action/fighting/death, awesomest friendship, a cute dog, solid fantasy and a bit of a thrill. READ THIS BOOK. Or you are missing out. Big time.",Kirstie Horton
9781619630345,"I decided to read this book because of the recent hype surrounding Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass #2) and other reviews for Throne of Glass. The library had a copy, so I picked it up, extremely excited for a leading lady as a kickass assassin. Unfortunately, this book didn't break the stereotypical YA mold for me for three reasons: 1) It contained an unecessary love triangle, 2) It advertised lots of action, but those few scenes were severely lacking in depth and description, and 3) Our leading lady, who starts out as a ruthless, cunning, and beautiful warrior is reduced to an often blundering, not very observant, and dress-obsessed girl, like so many before her. I don't want to make it seem like I hate this book! I actually enjoyed reading it, but I had quite a few problems with it as well, some of them probably stemming from some unrealistic expectations on my part (I've grown accustomed to expecting lots of action scenes when the book synopsis screams lots of action scenes), but others resulting in my sheer frustration with our main character, who seemed a little bipolar and at times totally clueless. What I did really like was the worldbuilding and Celaena's flashbacks scenes. I loved slowly getting information about Adarlan and its conquest of the other nations around it. The subtle hints to magic and magical creatures was fascinating, and I loved how it tied in with Celaena's background. Her upbringing as an assassin when alluded to was really interesting and lent a lot of needed depth to her character, especially during the second half of the book. Her experiences in the salt mines of Endovier clearly hardened her, and I enjoyed her cynical and sarcastic personality during the first part of the book. However, her character goes downhill for me after she rejoins court life in order to compete to become the king's champion (hired assassin). She devotes her social life to annoying the captain of the guard, Chaol, gossiping with a neighbouring land's princess, and reading books that the prince recommends to her (in addition to commenting on his good looks). She also obtusely ignores a very very clear ""I'm the ritual killer!"" hint in favour of suspecting someone who is only slightly suspicious. I literally sat there for five minutes, thinking to myself, What just happened? Why is she even suspecting this person when it is clearly the other? Similarly, the whole reason behind the killings seemed so unncessarily convoluted that I was let down by the ending. All-in-all I was very disappointed with Celaena's approach and thoughts about the mystery surrounding the killer. She was supposed to be this cunning assassin, but she just acted like a court lady the whole time. I also wished that the author had spent as much time devoted to developing her action scenes as she was describing the dresses Celaena wore. I wanted assassin action; she was a in a contest among other mercenaries, thiefs, and assassins, so I wanted more of that as well. There were probably two scenes devoted to actual contest action, and then one at the finale. Very disappointing for an action lover. Finally, that love triangle. I liked the part where it ended. Overall, this book is pretty entertaining, has an interesting main character (for the first half at least), and great worldbuilding. I'll be reading the next book because I'm intrigued about Celaena's background (before she became an assassin) and the magic of Terrasen, but I'm not looking forward to any remnant of that love triangle or under-developed action scenes.",Janita Van Dyk
9780142422014,"This review was originally posted on my blog: http://cosyingupwithbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/book-review-lola-and-boy-next-door-by.html This is the sequel to Anna and the French Kiss and, in no way, did it let the first book down! I loved the new characters and the fact that Anna and Etienne were prominent characters throughout. Firstly; the characters. Cricket was adorable in every way. The perfect amount of shy and confident when he needs to be. He was almost old-timey chivalrous towards Lola and I think he fit perfectly within the story. Lola was certainly a lot more extroverted and dramatic than Cricket but I really liked how she was the complete opposite to Anna. I was worried that the author would stick with what she knew worked but she didn't. Lola was a wonderful, enthusiastic person although her outfits sometimes made me want to cringe. I'm all for everyone being who they want to be and whatever but hell, this girl wore a new costume every day. That being said... I really did like the fact that she doesn't have one signature style yet she's still ALL Lola. The things Cricket did for Lola were small but meant a lot as in they were very personal. It wasn't like he bought her flowers and chocolates and confessed his love. He gave her a rubber band to wear on her wrist (which seems a helluva lot sweeter if you've actually read the book haha), he seemed to know exactly when she needed comfort and what to say, albeit a little awkwardly, but it was cute nonetheless. He also gave her the moon to hold in her hand so that she'd never be lonely and she'd always know he was with her, even when he was away. Again, these acts are a lot more meaningful if you know the reasons behind them! When I went into this book the one thing that a lot of reviewers had said was that Lola annoyed them with the decisions she made. Having read the book I totally disagree. Lola definitely made some bad decisions but don't all teenagers? From personal experience and a lot of silly falling outs I can tell you that it's perfectly normal for people to make mistakes. My worst mistake was only a couple of years ago when I was 16, a teenager, and I regret it but I sorted everything out. That's exactly what Lola did. She made everything right in the end and that's what matters. She was also the bigger person when it came to the whole Max situation towards the end. She held her head high even when he tried to knock her back down. You have to remember that that was actually a pretty realistic example of everyday choices and what they bring. Just because they're fictional characters does not mean they should be perfect. The character development when it came to Lola was immense - better than in AATFK by a mile. Maybe that was because there was a lot more for Lola to work through as I think she was a more developed character. Anna did have some great development by the end but nothing compared to Lola's. The ending was perfect. I'm not going to explain why or what it was because reading it without knowing anything was amazing. It was so perfect for her story and such a wonderful way to end the book. I kind of just sat there with the book to my chest as I ran the ending through my head again and again. It was so satisfying AND CRICKET YOU SWEET BOY, YOU. Okay... Now for the one thing I didn't like; Sometimes the drama got a little out of hand. I rationalised this by saying it was just Lola's character and maybe it was but sometimes, even with Lola being the one to bring the drama, it felt overworked and fake. That was the only thing that got me... I had a longer list of things I didn't like by the time I'd finished the book but when I read over them they didn't seem so bad and they made more sense after completing her story. (I make notes throughout reading so this happens a lot, whoops) Do I recommend this book? YES! Did I prefer this story to Anna's? No because Anna's story was the one that made me fall in love with Stephanie Perkins's writing and will therefore forever be my favourite book of hers. Should you add this book to your TBR? ABSOLUTELY!!! What did you guys think of Lola and the Boy Next Door? Was it your favourite in the series? Isla and the Happily Ever After - here I come!",Amber Smith
9781595143105,"Blood Promise begins right were Shadow Kiss left off. A massive strigoi attack has left St. Vladimir's Academy trying to deal with the multitude of casualties (moroi and dhampir) including Rose's mentor, and lover, Dimitri. She knows that Dimitri has, more than likely, been turned into a Strigoi against his will. Now, she is heading off to Russia to find him and fulfill the promise they made to each other about not wanting to live their lives as a Strigoi. Through Rose's adventures in Russia and Siberia, readers get to see a wider view of Mead's complicated and original supernatural world. There are lots of new characters and new ideas being thrust as Rose while she tries to find Dimitir. This provides her with real-world training and helps her mature rapidly. She can no longer be the impulsive, carefree teenager she once was. Rose must know use what she has learned both at the Academy and from Dimitri to survive and accomplish her goal. One of the most poignant plot points is the journey to Dimitri's hometown where Rose meets his mother, grandmother, and sisters. This provides her with a deeper understanding of dhampir culture away from guardian training. Readers and Rose have heard about communities where dhampirs live together without Moroi and provides an interesting perspective on Moroi/dhampir relations. In addition to the non-fighting dhampirs, Rose also sees rogue dhampirs who fight Strigoi without allegiance to the guardians. This allows her to see the positive and negative effects of becoming a vigilante like she has always threatened. Rose also gains a deeper understanding of strigoi in this book. She is searching for Dimitri and this forces her to interact with quite a few strigoi. The violence of their lifestyle is shown in all its brutal glory as well as the allure of their undead freedom. Readers have heard and seen bits and pieces about the strigoi, but this book provides a true look at the inner workings of this culture and why it can be so seductive and dangerous. There are many new characters that Rose meets in Russia and Siberia. The two most intriguing are Sydney the Alchemist and Abe Mazur the mysterious Moroi. Alchemists are a group that is new to Rose and she learns quite a bit about their mission to keep moroi/strigoi/dhampirs existence from the human population. Sydney seems to be a difficult character to like at first, but I found her rigid personality to be a fun foil for Rose. Abe Mazur is a flashy moroi who has taken an interest in Rose and seems to have connections throughout the world. I look forward to seeing more from these two fabulous new faces in the Vampire Academy world. In terms of old characters, most of the book follows Rose's adventures so there is little about the gang back at St. Vlad's. But, readers do get to see some through Rose's connection with Lissa since the guilt that Rose feels for abandoning Lissa in Shadow Kiss forces her to keep watch on her friend. Primarily, readers see Lissa deal with the shame of not helping Rose and of trying to deal with the darker side of her spirit powers without her. This is one of the first times that Lissa is forced to show her strength and it made me like her character a little bit more. We also continue to see Adrian, who communicates with Rose through his dream-walking abilities. This is sweet, humorous friendship that has a deeper undertone which is fascinating to read about. This book has a nice balance between action and drama with lots of twists and turns being thrown at the reader. The events of Shadow Kiss have turned Rose's world upside down and readers are watching her deal with these developments. Characters are changing and the adventures are getting more dangerous as the series slowly head towards its climax.",Sabrina
9781595143105,"My Summary: Unbelievably, Rose has left Lissa behind and traveled to Russia to find the man she loves so she can kill him. She knows the man she loved would never want to be a strigoi, killing those who he would have once died to protect. Rose can't move on until she knows he's at peace. But when the time comes, will she be able to do it? Can she really win against him? They were so evenly matched before he turned - now he will have the strigoi speed and strength to help him. And even if she can do it, what then? Having turned her back on Lissa, she can't just drop back into her old like. And speaking of Lissa, what will happen to her while Rose is off hunting strigoi? All her choices haunt her as Rose fights to do the only right thing she knows to do. My Thoughts: 5 stars - A MUST read The Blood Promise audiobook again changed narrators. I looked ahead and it seems that Emily Shaffer will read the rest of the series. I did like the change this time. Emily added the Russian accents back in that the narrator from book 2&3 had removed. I like the Russian accents. Dimitri just didn't sound like him without one. Emily does a good job with all the voices and I was able to sit back and enjoy the book without being distracted by the narrator, highest praise I can give. If you follow me on twitter, you may have witnessed my emotional breakdown during this book. I required much reassurance from trusted peeps that I could survive Dimitri as a strigoi. This book was sad. It's supposed to be sad. Rose is in the worst possible place in her life trying to do the worst possible task. What I really liked about this book was the path that Rose traveled. She dealt with grief and pain. She got to know the Dimitri of Russian, the young Dimitri and it was painful. She experienced such impossible situations. While she suffered and fell down many times, she was Rose. Her true heroism was firmly in place. I cried for her. I hurt for her. I was proud of her. She may have wished that she didn't do some of the things she did, but I thought she was noble in her efforts and accomplishments. Why do I make such a big deal out of this? Well, there was a series that I loved that the heroine didn't do what Rose did. She let the trials break her. I won't say what series but needless to say I was worried about Rose. It never happened. Rose is Rose - a kick butt badass in love with another one. As for the plot, it was crazy intense. Just as I thought I had something figured out, everything turned around and I was reeling. There were so many twists and turns in this story, I was beginning to feel like I had lost my normally incredible ability to figure things about before they happen. Alas, I did figure out a few so it's not gone. Not many though. It's an emotional roller coaster that was so much fun to ride, I was quickly back in line for more. Bring on book five. So glad this series is complete. Don't think I could handle a year wait between books. Just read it! It's fabulous.",Valerie Fink

9780141331867,"And I thought I'd had enough of vampires. After many beloved and some stereotypical YA vampire books in the past years I felt fine with putting that category on the waiting list for a while. Until I decided to pick up the first book in this series and Richelle Mead's VAMPIRE ACADEMY restored my faith in good and imaginative vampire worlds. I'd had my eyes on the VAMPIRE ACADEMY books for quite a while, many people kept recommending them and I can remember the rave about the last book in the series. Now with the first movie coming out in 2014 I couldn't hold out on this series any longer. Richelle's series isn't your average -There's a vampire in this story and he's gonna bite you, so you become one, too- story. In the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series you don't encounter ordinary vampires. There are different types of blood-suckers, like different links to an evolutionary chain. Our two heroines Rose and Lissa cover the two categories of Moroi and Dhampirs. Moroi are vampires who have the power to wield magic. Dhampirs are a crossing between Moroi and humans and their task is to protect royal Moroi. At the St. Vladimir's Academy they are receiving a special training for the purpose of becoming body guards when they are finished. Those two kinds are co-existing and depending on the other, never purposefully harming humans. The Strigoi make up the third and an entirely different category. They are soulless creatures only existing to destory and hurt humans, Moroi and Dhampirs alike. Strigoi are effortless killers, but they can also be cruel enough to turn the other vampires into one of them and doom them to become evil and heartless, too. They make for evil and seemingly unstoppable enemies in all six books of this series. The fight between Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi is the main focus of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series. Of course you can expect political, social and personal conflicts as well. Now the St. Vladimir's Academy is home to many Moroi and Dhampirs and is the central setting for the six books in this series. Housing, training and study rooms assembled like a small campus, the academic feel is definitely there. But with all the unexpected attacks and complications appearing on the scene it's no wonder Rose and her friends are forced to leave their textbooks behind and step into battle. The characters are travelling a lot, too. Really enjoyed seeing many new places together with Rose and her friends. All six books read on a book binge equal a huge vamptastic adventure beyond imagination. So much action and fights! However the series has its quiet moments, too. The greatest personal focus lies on the bond Rose and Lissa share as best friends and their spiritual bond that's pretty special for Moroi standards. Rose can feel what Lissa's feeling and in certain moments even see through Lissa's eyes. At first this was a very fun aspect about their friendship. The more often Rose visited Lissa's body though, story lows occurred. Sometimes I just felt like skipping these scenes altogether. Rose is the breakaway, tough and sexy warrior. Lissa her well-guarded, spiritual, emphatic protege. They are body and mind, friends who rule the hearts of many readers. They are lucky to have been gifted with two equally appealling love stories, slightly erotic, romantic and steamy for sure. Lissa finds Christian, an outsider, who was not even looking for acceptance until he met Lissa. They are healing each other from the wounds of their pasts and click together like a puzzle meant to exist. And Rose gets her love story with Dimitri. Just like everyone told me, that guy is sexy! Their difference in age and experience puts a forbidden touch to their love story. He is her instructor and she is supposed to keep her hands off him. Is that a dare? Major turn-on! BLOOD PROMISE is a lot about travelling and enduring hardships. It's probably the darkest book in this series! SPIRIT BOUND is about returning to the place you belong, your true self and the fight for justice. The books keep getting longer and longer. Currently LAST SACRIFICE is the longest book I've read so far this year. Not just in page count - 2688 pages- is this series truly epic, but in its emotional variety, youthful voices, and imaginative, adventurous story line. 5/5 ***** VAMPIRE ACADEMY Series- One of the most enthralling and memorable YA vampire worlds I've had the pleasure to live in. A series I wish I would have encountered much sooner. I'm so glad that all six books were released already and I could pick up the next book right after one was finished. I wouldn't have wanted to wait one year for each of them to come out. The first three BLOODLINES books are waiting on my Kindle to be read. The decision whether to start the series now or wait till all of them have been released has yet to be made.",MissPageTurner

After re-reading this book for a 3rd or 4th time, I thought I better write a review this time! Even after re-reading this book several times, it still remains my favourite dystopian book! 5/5 stars! The thing I love most about this book is Dauntless! Everything about that faction just excites, amazes, stuns me and even though it has its flaws I still think it would be the faction that IC/??d love to live in! As for the rest of the world building, I thought it was done extremely well and I understand all the politics and reasoning for the society, which sometimes is hard to understand in other dystopians! To be honest this whole society just blows me away, I think it was so creative! Onto the characters, I just love Tris as she is one strong heroine and never gives up. Even when she isnC/??t at her strongest and shows vulnerability, I still love her because even her weakest moments she wants to be strong. Then thereC/??s Four, who I just love! He has to be my top book crush, he is everything I could want! Strong, smart, brave, can be sweet when he want and to many thing other things to write! As for the relationship between the pair, I didnC/??t think it was cheesy or overdone, I thought it formed at a steady pace and was realistic. As for the other characters, Veronica Roth definitely knows how to make various characters three dimensional. There were characters I absolutely hated, and there were ones I loved, but above all these characters are very memorable and that is how you know the author created great characters. As for the plot, the pacing was fast and there was also action every few pages! This book had everything C/?? action, romance, friendship, a corrupt society, and so much more!

The first half took a bit to get through. I could put the book down during that and not have to pick it up again. Tris is a fantastic heroine. She is up there with the best of them -- Katniss and Hermione. (Sadly, I can only think of two right now off the top of my head.) She finds strength, power, knowledge, courage. Finds may be the wrong word. She always had it in her. She just didn't know it. Her love interest is great. Four is such a gem. I loved the cake comment. (Read the book. You'll understand.) They aren't sappy and it definitely wasn't insta-love. I got to see it develop. It was sweet. (This next part isn't a spoiler but it will be cryptic.) I was surprised by the ending and how fast it all wrapped up. The ending made me sad. I would have loved to know more about some people. I was surprised by the actions of some people. I wasn't surprised by those of others. But I wish it hadn't ended the way it did. Would I recommend it: Absolutely. Will I read it again: Probably, but first I want to read the rest of the series. Melissa's 4-star review Did I enjoy this book: Yep! It's not the next Mistborn series, but I'd wager Roth's books will end up ranked among the likes of Twilight and The Hunger Games. Her writing's not spectacular but her story is. Her plotlines aren't quite original but her characters are. Her dystopia's not...um... well, actually it IS. It's awesome. It's Harry Potter's Sorting Hat only without the cheering. It's dark, and grown-up, and exactly what I was hoping for. The internet tells me I ought to have low expectations for the second and third installments of Roth's series, but at this point I'm confident enough to hope for the best. Would I recommend it: Yep! Will I read it again: No, but I'm off to read book 2 just as soon as I get the chance. Belinda's 5-star review Did I enjoy this book: Yes. Divergent is flawless. Considering the attention the book has received coupled with the imminent blockbuster movie to be released, you probably already knew that. This story covers all the inevitable scary issues involved in growing up; separating from our parents, discovering where we belong, deciding who to trust, and learning to thrive in a dangerous and frightening world. Roth has it all. It's perfect . . . for a younger crowd. I fear there is a huge age gap between those who will undoubtedly be enthralled by this story and those who will say: It's good. It's entertaining. It's a work of art. And I couldn't relate to any of it. Reading this book made me feel like the stereotypical old fart. It's ok. I like being an old fart. This story reminded me how hard growing up is. I managed to survive all that. Well, I didn't have to go to war against my own neighborhood, but metaphorically at least, I survived the challenges represented in the book. Shew! Don't want to do it again; not even in fiction. Would I recommend it: Absolutely. Will I read it again: No.",Chrissy
9780062024022,"I don't really know what I can say about this book that hasn't been said hundreds of times before. But as it's one of my favourite book series and I have just reread it in time for Allegiant, I am going to review it for the blog anyway. Divergent is an amazing read, at least in my opinion. It gave me everything I could possibly ask for in a book, an amazing dystopian setting, a kick-ass female lead who just so happens to be short (as a fellow short person, I like this!), a great male lead who even I can fall for and twists and turns I don't see coming. Not to mention some rather amazing secondary characters that I really came to love. As far as main characters go, Tris was kind of perfect as far as I'm concerned. I think the reason I loved her so much was because of how hard she had to work. She wasn't amazing from the get go, she wasn't the best initiate, it was something she had to work for. I really liked that about her, it can get frustrating having characters who are the best at everything all the time. Plus, as I've said she is also tiny which is nice to find in a lead character! Next I must talk about Four - Four, Four, Four, Four!!! As far as love interest and male lead characters go, Four is actually swoon worthy to me and I never swoon. He was tough, mysterious but also caring and funny. I totally fell for Four in this book and Four will always be Four to me - I don't care if it's a nickname! As far as secondary characters go, Veronica Roth can really do no wrong. She gave me Tris' friends to love, her enemies to absolutely despise and those characters that keep you guessing. Dystopian fiction is my favourite genre and I can't seem to get enough of it. The factions in the book were something I really enjoyed and found really interesting. Even if I would have liked a tiny bit more explanation on them - when they were formed, why they were formed and how it all works. One great thing about this book, no stupid, annoying, frustrating love triangle. I am surely not the only person who is fed up of seeing these in books. Divergent is one of my all time favourites and the ending gets me every time I read it. This book was completely heartbreaking to me at times. When you finish it leaves you needing to know what happens next, thankfully all three books are out now so you won't have to wait. 5/5 Stars If you're looking for dystopian fiction with amazing characters, kick-ass action and a great romance then this is definitely for you!",Reviews from a Bookworm
9780062024022,"I am helplessly and utterly in love with this book. Divergent is one of those books that's like ""Oh, you wanna go outside and play? Here's a twist. Here's some action. Forget about outside"". Beatrice is struggling to find the good choice, the good faction for her, but is there such thing? Every faction has its ups and downs. I liked the fact that I could easily remember the characters. I have quite a problem with character remembering, especially when tons of them are thrown in my face - which is a reason I never finished Hamlet -but with Divergent is easy to recall even those who were only mentioned once. You stumble upon the best male character you can ever read. How do I begin to describe Four? I love him with the power of a thousand suns. He's the kind of boyfriend that brings the best of you, makes you stronger, because when you're down, he doesn't look at you with pity, what would pity solve? He's the kind of man that's intelligent, not thirsty for power and despite his age, his maturity is off the charts. And he has muscles. It's such an easy read, since intrigues over intrigues keep showing up and leave you wanting more. The world Veronica Roth described with such passion has definitely left a mark on me, because you're there with the character, you're there seeing through her eyes and despite the drawbacks, it's a beautiful world. I simply cannot WAIT to read Insurgent!! I recommend this book, it's a must read, really.. There's nothing not to like. Action, twists, romance and a well written story... what more do you want?",Ioana Culcea
9780062024022,"I absolutely love this book! I read many reviews raving about how great this book was, so I decided to read it myself. If you like The Hunger Games trilogy you will absolutely love this book!! I am currently on the second book: Insurgent!",Sengul Korkmaz
9780062024022,I had just finished reading the hunger games and was hungry for another dystopian novel to read i searched the net and came across divergent and let me just say that the hype from this book was well worth it!! It has similarities to the hunger games but Divergent is a level of its self i loveeeed this book so much i read it in 1 day i just couldn't do anything but read it! Veronica makes a connection with all the characters to make us feel for them and worry what will happen to them. And let me just say OMG Four! Where can i get one!? Im not gonna give away too much but this book is 100% worth the read you will not be disappointed!!,Gemma Saw
9781442416895,"I read City of Heavenly fire about a week after it was released, I loved it so much but I did have some problems with it. Firstly I thought that Cassandra Clare's writing at the start was a bit slow and uncertain. I felt like she was trying to get back into the books after City of Lost Souls. I did love the fight seen and how you could slowly see the world start to come together. About 100 pages into the book I felt the words and the atmosphere pick up. That was when in my opinion the book became great. Secondly I really loved how Casandra Clare made all the characters seem so real and I found myself laughing out loud and crying my eyes out at certain points in this book. The world that is created in this book is beautiful and some place that I think must have taken a while to put into words. This book is fantastic and I loved it. The world created took me away and I have spent years waiting for each of the books to come out. Cassandra Clare's writing style is beautiful and I can't wait to read her new books. I give City of Heavenly fire 5 out of 5 stars and hope that everyone else reading this book loved it as mush as I did!",g'The Little Book Queeng'

9780141328522,"Well, although I was pretty much obsessed with vampire books at the time I read Vampire Academy, there's still something about this book-or should I say book series- that keeps me re-read it over and over again. I don't know if it is witty and sarcastic personality of main character, her self-destroying quest to protect her best friend and everyone she loves, or rich background story of the world they live in, or even maybe- not so cheesy- love story, that just made me keep on re-reading it over and over again, but what I do know is that this is very well balanced YA book. It has a good story and very,very good plot twists. Characters are interesting, and variate in personalities quiet a lot. When it comes to the first book in the series (Vampire Academy),it isn't the best one, but it's still interesting enough to get you to keep on reading. If you like YA books with strong main character, I highly recommend this series.",Dragana
9780141328522,"Ita??s been an extremely long time since Ia??ve been so hooked to a book that Ia??ve read it within a few hours over the space of two days. But thata??s exactly what has happened here. Vampire Academy has been a book that Ia??ve wanted to read for a while and even more so when I knew that there was a movie coming out. The book had me hooked from beginning to end. There wasna??t a moment where a page wasna??t filled with action, adventure or extremely interesting histories. The plot didna??t feel like it dragged at all and there was always something there that kept me reading. Throughout the book I didna??t really know what was going to happen next which made me want to read on. There was only something that threw you off track every time you took a guess about something and it kept you on your toes. The twists in the plot werena??t pointless either and werena??t there just as a filler. All the twists seem to interlock with each other and added up to the big picture. Rose has to be one of my favourite characters. I love the fact that shea??s so defensive and Lissa and wona??t back down from a fight when she knows that shea??s in the right. I loved the way that her character slowly started to change for the better when she started to realise her responsibility but you could still see the fiery side in her that still came out during the book. I got slightly worried before I had read the book that it was all going to be based around the forbidden romance that it mentioned in the blurb but I was quite happily surprised that that was far from the case. You could see there elements of romance in the book but Richelle Mead did a really good job making sure that It was a small sub plot that didna??t take away from the main point of the book. You could see Anaa??s feelings develop midway through the book but there werena??t chapters of the book dedicated to it which was a really nice change. It made the book a lot more enjoyable for me since I really wasna??t looking for a supernatural romance book. I found the history that was put into the book extremely interesting. I loved reading the background of the Academy and about the Moroi. Even the charactersa?? histories were really intriguing. It gave you an insight into all the characters and what brought them to place that they are in. I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in this series and Richelle Mead has done an amazing job of captivating her readers into this world.",Saira Ahmed
9780141328522,"And I thought I'd had enough of vampires. After many beloved and some stereotypical YA vampire books in the past years I felt fine with putting that category on the waiting list for a while. Until I decided to pick up the first book in this series and Richelle Mead's VAMPIRE ACADEMY restored my faith in good and imaginative vampire worlds. I'd had my eyes on the VAMPIRE ACADEMY books for quite a while, many people kept recommending them and I can remember the rave about the last book in the series. Now with the first movie coming out in 2014 I couldn't hold out on this series any longer. Richelle's series isn't your average -There's a vampire in this story and he's gonna bite you, so you become one, too- story. In the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series you don't encounter ordinary vampires. There are different types of blood-suckers, like different links to an evolutionary chain. Our two heroines Rose and Lissa cover the two categories of Moroi and Dhampirs. Moroi are vampires who have the power to wield magic. Dhampirs are a crossing between Moroi and humans and their task is to protect royal Moroi. At the St. Vladimir's Academy they are receiving a special training for the purpose of becoming body guards when they are finished. Those two kinds are co-existing and depending on the other, never purposefully harming humans. The Strigoi make up the third and an entirely different category. They are soulless creatures only existing to destory and hurt humans, Moroi and Dhampirs alike. Strigoi are effortless killers, but they can also be cruel enough to turn the other vampires into one of them and doom them to become evil and heartless, too. They make for evil and seemingly unstoppable enemies in all six books of this series. The fight between Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi is the main focus of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series. Of course you can expect political, social and personal conflicts as well. Now the St. Vladimir's Academy is home to many Moroi and Dhampirs and is the central setting for the six books in this series. Housing, training and study rooms assembled like a small campus, the academic feel is definitely there. But with all the unexpected attacks and complications appearing on the scene it's no wonder Rose and her friends are forced to leave their textbooks behind and step into battle. The characters are travelling a lot, too. Really enjoyed seeing many new places together with Rose and her friends. All six books read on a book binge equal a huge vamptastic adventure beyond imagination. So much action and fights! However the series has its quiet moments, too. The greatest personal focus lies on the bond Rose and Lissa share as best friends and their spiritual bond that's pretty special for Moroi standards. Rose can feel what Lissa's feeling and in certain moments even see through Lissa's eyes. At first this was a very fun aspect about their friendship. The more often Rose visited Lissa's body though, story lows occurred. Sometimes I just felt like skipping these scenes altogether. Rose is the breakaway, tough and sexy warrior. Lissa her well-guarded, spiritual, emphatic protege. They are body and mind, friends who rule the hearts of many readers. They are lucky to have been gifted with two equally appealling love stories, slightly erotic, romantic and steamy for sure. Lissa finds Christian, an outsider, who was not even looking for acceptance until he met Lissa. They are healing each other from the wounds of their pasts and click together like a puzzle meant to exist. And Rose gets her love story with Dimitri. Just like everyone told me, that guy is sexy! Their difference in age and experience puts a forbidden touch to their love story. He is her instructor and she is supposed to keep her hands off him. Is that a dare? Major turn-on! The first book in the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series is funnily the one book which I liked least out of the six books in this series. I don't remember it as overly significant to the story, not remarkable character development-wise. Its writing feels a bit clumsier than the other books. While I read all six books back to back, I definitely saw a noticeable evolution over the entire series in writing, story line, character development, and surprising moments. The books keep getting longer and longer. Currently LAST SACRIFICE is the longest book I've read so far this year. Not just in page count - 2688 pages- is this series truly epic, but in its emotional variety, youthful voices, and imaginative, adventurous story line. 5/5 ***** VAMPIRE ACADEMY Series- One of the most enthralling and memorable YA vampire worlds I've had the pleasure to live in. A series I wish I would have encountered much sooner. I'm so glad that all six books were released already and I could pick up the next book right after one was finished. I wouldn't have wanted to wait one year for each of them to come out. The first three BLOODLINES books are waiting on my Kindle to be read. The decision whether to start the series now or wait till all of them have been released has yet to be made.",MissPageTurner
9780141328522,"Okay, I've read a lot of books about vampires and, although this is not my favorite one I really enjoyed it. The plot was really good, it's for me the first time that I read about ""alive vampires"" and ""dead vampires"". I thought they were all dead, you see. For a change it's refreshing to have a story that is not so focused on love but on friendship and loyalty. And don't get me wrong, I'm all about love (romance is one of my favorite topics) but to be able to ""feel"" what Rose and Vasilisa (I love her name!) go through... I truly believe friendship is one of the most important things in life. In this book we get the idea of an academy that is set in this world but we, humble normal humans, don't know anything about it. We see the story through Rose' eyes. And, let me tell you, she is one of the best heroines I've read about. She is strong, confident and sometimes, most of them to protect or help Vasilisa, arrogant and bad mouthed. But she is also very loyal, and that's why I love her. Lisa -or Vasilisa- is the complete opposite to Rose. After losing here family she loses her confidence and becomes very shy and vulnerable. But at the same time she would do anything to help Rose. And she hides a secret, a very interesting secret that can change her live - and Rose's live- for ever. Now, don't get me wrong. Vasilisa isn't stupid... in fact, no one should mess with her. And I like that ""dark side"" of hers. Now, for the male characters... I totally and utterly loved Dimitri (I have a thing for Russian names xD). How focused he is, the way he controls his own feelings in order to protect Lisa just because it's how things work... Please, tell me, would you be able to do something like that? Without having second thoughts? I wish I could say yes, but I'm not sure. We have also Christian, the ""bad/mysterious"" guy who is an outsider in the academy for something his parents did... But he has charisma and, deep down is a good boy. And the end of the book... I most certainly wasn't expecting that so the surprise was REALLY good. I can't wait to read the next one. Read it, you won't get dissapointed.",Alaiel Kreuz
9780141328522,"Vampire Academy is the first book in the six-story installment of the Vampire Academy series. I was hooked onto the story right from the start, all the way to the latest one. The way Richelle Mead tells the story is just excellently done. It is a pleasing story about a teenage girl by the name of Rose Hathaway who is ignorant towards the real world but as the tory goes on she realises the difference between the real world and the Academt which she lives in. Sworn to protect her best friend she realises that the Academy isn't as what it was initially thought out to be. Overall it was a pleasing story which i'll be willingly happy to read over-and-over again.",janice
9780141328522,"I'll admit that I put off reading this series for quite a while because, well, I judged a book by its cover. No offense to the model, it's just not exactly the kind of cover that catches your eye and makes you want to read the book. Another thing that deterred me was the title Vampire Academy; it's just too... obvious I think. The titles of the rest of the books in the series are great - Frostbite, Shadow Kiss, Blood Promise, Spirit Bound. Now that I've read it, let's just say I regret not reading it straight away. I loved this book! I can't think of a single flaw, or anything that annoyed me! The characters are so well-written that they feel like real people, each with their own distinct personalities. Rose, the narrator, is fierce and very strong willed. She is absolutely loyal to Lissa and has a wicked sense of humor. Lissa, on the other hand, wouldn't hurt a fly. She relies heavily on Rose to be there for her as she goes through dark times. And Dimitri *swoons* how I love Dimitri! To find out why you'll just have to read the book. The mythology of Vampire Academy is awesome and very well thought out. Between Moroi, Strigoi, Dhampirs and plain old humans, there are a lot of different strengths and weaknesses among the different characters. That comes into play a lot more in the later books in the series. The elemental magic is very interesting though its not really talked about a lot. The action is great and the plot twists totally unexpected. I must admit that there are a lot of similarities between Vampire Academy and the House Of Night Series by P.C. & Kristin Cast. They're both about vampire schools, both contain elemental magic, both have good and evil versions of vampires and both have vampire protectors. As much as I hate comparing books, because each are great stories in their own right, I would have recommend Vampire Academy over Marked. It is much more mature and the writing is of a higher quality. Overall, I loved Vampire Academy and am giving it 5 stars out of 5. I recommend it to all lovers of all kinds of fantasy, vampire stories, and paranormal romance. What are you waiting for? Go read it!",Amy Mansell
9781406330397,"The beginning was a little slow for me, because honestly it has been so long and only certain details stuck with me. I skimmed some of the book but was totally immersed in others. I think that once I got into the action and figured out what was going on again, the reason I would be taken out of the story is that it felt choppy to me when it was switching between the characters. They should have been some sort of marker showing when it switched the focus. The part that kept my attention the most was the Tessa/Jem/Will scenes. There is so much tension and I am smack in the middle of it with my heart. I don't know the right answer, because someone gets hurt, or Jem has to finally die. Which would suck. And may or may not be a part of this story. I don't know because when I wrote this part of the review I was only 200 pages in. Just a hunch of what will happen. There were so many twists, hot scenes, amazing heart fluttering declarations that I didn't know what to do with myself for the last part though. I think the ending was as perfect as I could possibly think of or imagine considering and it made me happy with the story.

9781907411175,"I'm not quite sure whether I loved this book or loathed it. In my opinion, it was better than some of the Twilight Saga books but worse than the others. Bree Tanner is quite an interesting character and that makes up for some of the strange things Bella says and does but all and all a 3/5 really is the best rating you can give it.",Libby
9781907411175,"I'm going to be honest, I wan't interested in reading this book. I read the entire Twilight saga and I liked it, but I just preferred to read something else. So I wasn't going to read this book until I broke my arm and my parents wanted to give me a gift. I pick it up, and I was instantly hooked. The writing reminded me why I read and enjoyed Twilight. It may not be a classic, but it doesn't let you go. I just kept reading until I finished. I vaguely remembered Bree from her 5 seconds of fame at Eclipse, but of course in this book she is the main character. She is a very young girl with a good heart. Nervous and very scared, in a way she remind me of Bella. It was nice to read her, easy. She makes you feel comfortable. The story was much more than I was expecting, but that is probably because I wasn't expecting anything at all. You get to read more about vampires, specially newborn, but I didn't read anything new about that. But the author creates another side of the story that was interesting enough to keep reading, even when you know what was going to happen. I actually enjoyed it, and I recommend it if you read Twilight serie and liked it. You shouldn't miss it.",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9781934964101,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. This was the worst book in the series for me. It's Scott's 24th birthday and he has matured a bit like I wanted him to over the course of these books. At least he's no longer using girls and being a major jerk, though he is still a jerk. Ramona's behaviour is suddenly all out of character and she appears to just disappear. o..kay?... Anyone doing the math is not surprised to know that this book's boyfriend will have to be twins, otherwise how do we get 7 evil boyfriends out of 6 books; as any videogamer knows the last one is going to be reserved for the Boss. So no surprise there. The battle scene was very low key and seemed as if the author had actually gotten tired of the whole evil boyfriend plot himself! While fighting, this Japanese duo seemed to have much more fun dishing the dirt on Ramona to Scott than actually winning the fight. Not all characters appear in this volume and some only make cameo appearances; the book highly concentrates on Scott, Ramona and Kim. Scott has a rendezvous with Gideon, the last evil boyfriend, the Boss, the one behind all this madness, who has all the answers; by the volume's end. This sets up the final book but doesn't leave me excited in anyway. Though I've lost my get-go for this series, with only one more book to go till journey's end I will be reading the final volume soon.",Nicola Mansfield
9780374400118,"Nancy Garden's ANNIE ON MY MIND, originally published in 1982, was recently re-released. (It includes an interview with the author herself.) The book represents an early example of realistic young adult fiction depicting a lesbian relationship between two high school seniors. It is still a fitting portrayal for today's teens. Liza and Annie meet in a New York museum and develop a fast friendship. Both seem to realize there is something different about their relationship, but admitting that at the start is difficult for both. The story is told as Annie remembers it, and focuses mostly on her struggle to accept the facts she is learning about herself. The book's first half takes the reader into the growing friendship between the girls. There is considerable time spent describing how they discover their common interests and the activities they find to spend time together. The girls come from different backgrounds - Liza attends a relatively sheltered, private school currently struggling with financial difficulties, while Annie attends public school and is faced with drugs, violence, and other social problems public schools must deal with both then and now. As the girls' relationship develops, the plot becomes more involved in Liza's role as student council president and her school's struggle with a fund-raising campaign. Liza and Annie begin to accept the true direction of their friendship, and of course, as other people become aware, controversy surfaces. Will the admission of their gay lifestyle cause acceptance or abandonment by family and friends? Could their situation adversely affect a similar relationship between two teachers in Liza's private school? ANNIE ON MY MIND delves into the acceptance of homosexuality. It seems there will always be two sides to this controversy, but the re-release of the book may ask readers to decide if things are changing as time passes. What really matters in love - what is ""right"" for those involved or what is perceived as ""right"" by those whose views may differ?",TeensReadToo
9780062085573,"Inevitable spoilers for Shatter Me and Unravel Me. Spoiler Free for Ignite Me though! I wanted to read Ignite Me, because I have loved the books in the series (minus not being thrilled about the last novella) and I had to know what would happen in this dark world where nothing is quite as it seems. There is a love triangle that I am crazy for and I don't even know how I want it to end. My thoughts towards both have changed since I first met them and I usually have a gut feeling who will win out even if that is not the guy that I like the most. Warner has revealed so much about himself that I never would have guessed, showing he has a heart and the depths of his feelings for Juliette are great and that his actions have been carefully planned to try to win her heart and do things for the sector. Adam, I always just liked but despite their physical attraction and their past together, I just am torn because they have both changed so much since then and that really changes their dynamic. Plus of what I read in his novella, it really made me sad some of the thoughts and ways he viewed her and besides she makes a statement in this one that confirms another nagging suspicion I had. They are now on a more even playing field and I feel like they have had their books to shine, and I just need to know who will earn her heart and what will become of the other. So, not only did I want resolution for the love triangle that has stolen my heart, I also wanted to see further character development in Juliette and see how she steps up to be a key in peace and a better life in this dark world. Pretty quickly we get into the story and seeing some of this growth in Juliette. While she is torn apart and grieving over the losses, she sees this healing and second chance at life in a new way, with determination. She isn't sure if her friends are alive and she is still wavering on Warner, which is understandable because while he has revealed some and they have had some pretty intense and hot moments together, she hasn't been inside his head quite like we have, and there were still lots of dark choices he's had to make. I loved the conversations they had together and just seeing how softened he gets toward Juliette and when he loses his composure and we glimpse through the facades. We do get an answer about whether or not her friends are alive. We also get lots of insight into them in unexpected ways. Through Juliette we discover how heavy Kenji's burdens were with being the funny one, having to really shoulder his grief in different ways. We see the ruins of Omega, and know that it meant even if Adam and some others lived through it, then there were still great losses. I don't know if I have just completely gotten used to the style and there is also the fact that we aren't really experiencing things through Juliette's writing. But the writing and the way Juliette's mind works is really still just so poetic and beautiful to me. It is unlike anything I have read really and it makes the books extra special. I am glad that it is still there even if not as shocking as book one with the setup. And of course, Juliette makes a choice for which guy in this book, and with all of the work up to it, I agree with her so much. It ends up being the best decision for her, and the one that spurs her on to do what she needs to do to help bring down the reestablishment and make changes for a better world. It is someone who proves he sees her heart, believes in her, and has the love and support for her. There was a lot of action towards the end as well as some surprise characters that made life even more difficult for Juliette and crew. She had to make some hard choices along the way, but watching her learn her strength and how to not only be stronger for herself but for others was amazing to watch. She had more help learning to master her powers and how to use them in order to gain control and to take down Anderson. Ms. Mafi also manages to break up the tension and weight of their mission by some awesomely swoony scenes. One of the best YA scenes that while it eventually faded to black, it had me sweating and sighing, wishing I was Juliette in that moment. She also manages to write in some hilarious scenes that had me snorting and literally laughing out loud as I read. I did not want to put down this book, and I am wholly satisfied with this conclusion to this series that has captured my attention and my heart. Tahereh Mafi has a bold writing style and she took some risky moves in these books that paid off, and made me love and remember them even more than I thought possible. I think that the threads were tied off well, and that we have closure on the series, though I do think that it could have been well served with a bit of an epilogue, seeing a glimpse of Juliette's triumph and how the world begins to change into something better, and also a glimpse into the one not chosen to see how that works for him. But otherwise, perfection in hundreds of pages. I despised every moment I had to put the book down, and I am left with a Juliette and crew sized hole in my heart because I will miss these characters and their amazingly awesomeness. Bottom Line: F*ing awesome series conclusion. Brave, addictive, hot, and full of action, character growth and resolution.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780316077033,"This book exceeded my expectations so much. Most of the books that I read that are over hyped I end up not enjoying that much. That was not the case with this book. The writing style of the two authors came together in such a great way that it flowed and was just so great to read. A pet peeve of mine with most young adult novels is that I fell like they do not have enough descriptions and I find it hard to envision the places and people. This was another thing that this book did not suffer from. Everything was described so well and beautifully. The book is a really big book but the way it flowed made me read it so quickly that I felt as if the book were much shorter and wanted more when the book ended. Ethan was a really relate able character that was really well developed as well as all of the other characters, but I felt like I really got to know and love Ethan and really cannot wait to read the rest of the series to find out what happens to his relationship and rest of his life after high school. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a different ya book and one that is really well written.",Jessica Gibbins
9780316077033,"Beautiful Creatures is set in old Southern town where everyone knows all your dirty little secrets and appearances are everything! Complete with narrow mind house-wives waving their warm home cooked meals in their southern bell dresses, the town runs accordingly to their wishes. There's nothing that doesn't conform to their way, that is until Lena Duchannes strolls in and moves in with the town shut in, Macon Ravenwood, that things start to fall astray. Ethan Wate a local boy who's been having strange dreams about a girl who keeps falling inches away from his grasp, realizes that Lena Duchannes, the girl who wears the wrong clothes, speaks her mind and also happens to be Galtin's newest outcast, is the girl of his dreams. Literally. The countdown is on to Lena's birthday, the day she either turns Light or Dark, oh and don't forget the 200 year old curse that Lena and Ethan's ancestors caused that now plaque them both. The idea's behind this book are extremely complex, the mythology at times can be hard to keep up with, but I however found the richness of details made the story more compelling. There's a lot of mystery mix up within the novel, with bits of information slowly pieced out to reveal the complexity. The romance was insanely adorable, Ethan *sighs* there are no words to describe how cute and gentle-manlike he was, Ethan really was a true Southern gentleman. Every kiss was filled with the exhilarating feeling of star-crossed lovers and forbidden love that I like so much! As Lena and Ethan's relationship progressed we see the difficulties they have to overcome, and boy, there are some huge mountains they have to climb to be together. The more you read you see just how hard that's ultimately going to be. Beautiful Creatures is a very enjoyable read, although it may be a bit unnecessarily long, if you power through it I think you'll love it. I recommend it to anyone who's interested in Southern tales filled with a heart aching romance and captivating magic.",Taylor Weeks
9780316077033,"Beautiful Creatures is indeed an epic read that is dark, mysterious and everything like the cover. I honestly, did not expect to like this book at all and expected very little from it. From my past experiences with books that everyone's hyped up about. I always ended up indifferent to it. But this one was an exception that I actually liked, not as much as I wanted to like it. But I liked it enough to give it four stars. Kami and Margaret wrote the book in such a way that it always seemed gloomy and dark. The atmosphere in the book gave me the creeps. A lot of it. The book had your usual new girl, who has special powers and town boy falls in love with her. Despite that basic Young Adult Paranormal structure, the authors managed to surround that with tons of originality that pretty much filled the entire book till it reached 530 pages. Lena and Ethan were okay characters that honestly did annoy me sometimes. I even face-palmed myself once in awhile. But they were sweet together and they made me go ""aww"" sometimes. I was even surprised when the book was told in Ethan's perspective and not Lena's. I'm glad it was the hero this time. It made the book feel really refreshing. When Lena moves into town, she is immediately disliked and shunned when they all find out that she is the niece of the town shut in. She is bullied not only in school by the students but also by the student's parents. I admired Ethan's tenacity for sticking up for her especially when he is putting his reputation in jeopardy. The plot and other minor characters were so beautifully built with enough detail and a lot of dialogue to paint the perfect image in any readers mind. I'm amazed at how easily you can go through each page, not only because of the content but because of how easily to read the formatting was. It wasn't one of those books that love squishing a hell lot of paragraphs in one page. This was more breezy and simple. Overall, I liked Beautiful Creatures, it had dark voodoo magic, magic in general and interesting mythologies that keeps a reader captivated. Despite the length of the book, I still managed to flip through pages and that is a perfect sign of an entertaining and enjoyable book.",Najla Qamber
9780316077033,"At first I wasn't that thrilled to pick up Beautiful Creatures, because I thought about this novel as another small town story about a boy and a girl who can't be together, involving the same elements of love, same elements of danger as in so many other novels. Right now I have to reverse my thoughts and sayings about this novel. My love for Beautiful Creatures, started just with the perspective it's told from, the male protagonists POV, Ethan Wate. As many YA novels are told from a female POV I was a bit concerned I couldn't warm to Ethan. Well, I could warm to him, even more, I had to experience that a story told from Ethan's perspective can get very hot sometimes. I love how Kami and Margaret gave him personality, feelings and the gift to share them with the persons he loves. The way Ethan and Lena fall in love is unusual, they both have a special connection and when they first meet, both immediately know, they've known each other for more than a second then. Lena tries to hide from Ethan's attention, is afraid of letting him in, scaring him away. But Ethan is determined to find a way to Lena even if it means offending the rest of small town Gatlin. They both are unique characters, together they became one of my favourite literary couples. Beautiful Creatures stands out due to a, for some people cosy, for Ethan terribly boring and lonely, setting turning into a mysterious and miraculous place. Beautiful Creatures is about a young love between mortal and super-""natural"" interlaced with the story of ancient Civil War and a curse that has not only affected their powers but true identity and feelings since then. This novel holds the very innovative idea of combining history with the story of a paranormal romance. The writing style and language of Beautiful Creatures is rich and absorbing, very surprising when you think of it as a novel written by four hands (make it some more, counting in the daughter- slaves). While reading the brilliant ending of Beautiful Creatures, I had to get up in the middle of the night and turn the computer on again to order its sequel. The end was a spectacle of unexpected events and great feelings. Although this novel has no major cliff hanger at the end, there are many questions unanswered. It's the looming storm only a few more days away which makes me want to read the sequel immediately. There are so many great characters living in small Gatlin, everyone different but still important for the storyline, the city could burst just because of its enormously diverse character collection. So the roles are defined. Initiator of the gloomy curse: Civil War ancestor. Young cursed lovers: Ethan Wate and Lena Duchannes. The malice enemy: you'll be surprised! And last but not least, the satisfied but still hungry reader: You! Beautiful Creatures made be feel like a cast myself: being released into an universe of numerous magical possibilities but everytime riveted by the spellbinding words of two powerful casters. THE VERDICT Beautiful Creatures is a must-read for fans of paranormal romance that place a high value on an exciting storyline, unique characters and the potential for many unforeseen events. You are totally spellbound by this book and believe it's a cast? No, it's just the magic of an amazing new YA novel!",MissPageTurner

9780142419779,"First of all, I had rather high expectations before I started to read the book. It was praised as one of the best books of the year so I was looking forward to jumping into a highly recommended dystopian novel. It was a nice and fast read, not complicated and enjoyable at several points. As usually I needed about 100 pages to really get into the book, to get used to the structures of the dystopian world. And I have to say that I missed a full, satisfying draft of the society and its structures. We learned about the process of pairing and the different classes and their associated duties and their determined leisure activities, but I missed somehow a clear picture of how the society really works and why. However some aspects in the world building were very authentic and therefore pretty terrifying such as the complete control of the society over its citizens. Imagining someone controlling how much and what I eat, controlling what I????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??m doing all the time and actually organizing my life no matter what I desire to do is intolerable. So the problematic of this kind of society was well elaborated. The plot is from the beginning on light even though it became visible that something disturbing was happening inside the society from page to page. Firstly the reader accompanies Cassia in her daily routine as well as to her matching ceremony. We get to know her and her feelings and make acquaintance with Xander, her matched partner and Ky, a boy who is not a full part of the society as for the pairing process. He is not designated to be matched with someone. Surprisingly after the pairing ceremony Cassia discovers that Ky might be her ideal partner and not Xander and starts to raise to question if the whole system is actually deception. Of course she now falls in love with Ky, which happens too fast in my opinion. This fact kind of degrades the character of Cassia a little, cause it assumes that she is not that profound and sensitiv as I imagined her to be. Nevertheless the books elaborates well the cleavage Cassia has between Xander, who is honestly in love with her and Ky, who is not supposed to be in love with her, but definitely is as well. Cassia chooses Ky and the drama begins. Secret conversations about poetry and art which is prohibited in the community heat their love and in the end we face a drastic problem which makes the maintenance of their secret love impossible. I actually enjoyed the writing style. It was deep and poetic in some points. At other points a little too superficial for my taste, but I guess appropriate for a young adult novel. The different characters with their different voices came out quite good. I think everybody sympathizes more with Ky but I thought that Xander has a stronger character which is somewhat outstanding. All in all only an okay read for me, but for romance lovers of especially the younger kind a wonderful read about love, poetry and limits a society can set you as well as the thought of outbreaking of such patterns. Perfect for teenagers. :) ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/?? 2 of 5 stars",Isabel Lazarovici

9780142419779,"Everyone around the blogosphere seemed to be enthusiastic about Matched so I was really looking forward to read it. Unfortunately I didn't get to like this novel as much as all the Cassie & Ky or Xander fans out there. At first glance Condie created a very interesting setting of a dystopian novel, featuring classical elements and new ones, inhuman and sterile. Citizens are not allowed to show deeper sentimental reactions in public and rarely at home, that they care for someone or something beyond a superficial level. The individual stands back to the society's benefits, and that I can call a successful adaption of a dystopian background to our story around heroine Cassia. What I found most disturbing is the exact controlling of the death date of each citizen. Cassia, the obedient citizen in the beginning, starts questioning the system when a picture of Ky instead of her promised match appears on her monitor. After the mistake, she starts noticing him and tries to understand the true Ky. They spend time together, learn about each other and who they really are. A relation between Cassia, Ky and Xander is obvious, but not really a love triangle as I couldn't see feelings beyond friendship between Cassia and Xander in the beginning. I wish the love story would be a more dominant part of Matched. I am a hopeless romantic and expected this novel to be more specific and detailed when it comes to the rarely featured love scenes. As other novels describe the scene of the lover's meeting vividly, Condie describes a kiss or a hug as a fact and not the act of many different emotions, tastes, smells and feelings coming together. This lack of emotional details and description of romantic scenes, might be attribute to the dystopian character of minimalism when it comes to deeper feelings and meanings or a major sign of Condie's average writing style. The society of Matched is divided into different groups of workers and their complexity of thoughts and actions are reduced to guarantee a simple but secure standard. Condie's writing style is as simple as her created society, it is not my favourite but at least supports the story's character well. One aspect I really liked about Matched is that Ky and Cassia find and interpret old symbols and art in a world that doesn't know their meaning anymore. People have forgotten what a compass or handwriting is and now it is on both of them to turn something so uncommon into their weapon against a meaningless and indifferent government. Surprises are rare as we follow a steady rhythm and the first three hundred pages replay a certain routine. The tide of this novel is low, and I drifted on it slowly from moment to moment. I got an appropriate impression of Cassia's life and her district, but almost felt annoyed by this novel's slow pace always expecting something more spectacular happen on the next page. In the last eighty or so pages speed picked up and I found myself in the middle of action, thinking: ""Dear action, there you are, but why haven't you showed up two hundred pages earlier!?"" THE VERDICT Matched can be described as a light romance with main interest on dystopian setting, so this novel definitely is a recommendable read for fans of dystopian tellings of all stripes. I am going to read the sequel when it comes out, but with much less pre- enthusiasm than I felt toward Matched.",MissPageTurner

Jason is the son of Zeus (but he keeps calling him Jupiter, Zeus' Roman name), Pyper is the daughter of Aphrodite, and Leo is the son of Hephaestus. Still coming into their powers, the three are whisked away on a quest. Their mission: find the missing Hera before the Giant King (the Greek gods' greatest enemy) raises a force so evil that mankind will be utterly doomed. The trio only has three days and has only one clue to go on: find Boreas, the god of the North Wind. Will Pyper, Leo, and Jason be able to save the world? Will Jason ever figure out who he really is? Who really took his memories? Why does he keep calling gods by their Roman names? A great new addition to the PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS series.

9780316077040,"My review: This next book picks up not long after the first in the series, Beautiful Creatures, ends. In my opinion, this book is darker than the first, coming on the heels of personal tragedy within the story line. I think one of the things I loved the most was how grief was handled. It wasn't glossed over at all, giving it total reality. The setting of a southern small town, along with the gothic elements, is a definite stereotype of southern living, and maybe a little over the top. But it works perfectly within the context of the story and sets the stage for even more secrets to be revealed. There was much more development of the characters in this book, too, which really brought some of the characters to life. Interestingly, one of the characters that most came to life for me was one that was actually dead. Ethan was much more of a strong presence in this book, a lot of his story being his own instead of entwined with Lena's. The angst level was a lot higher in this book, something that usually tends to annoy me. But it is something that really worked for this story. It added a pretty dark layer to the entire story and served to underscore a lot of the issues in the book. Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --Answers. A lot of questions were answered in this installment of the Beautiful Creatures series. --Questions. As many questions that were answered, there were all kinds of new questions that leave me wanting to start the next book. Things I wanted more of... --The mundane world. Most of the story took place in the Caster world and not nearly as much in the non-magical world. I missed the blend. My recommendation: You definitely have to read these in order to experience the flow of the story. I think the story was better than the last and I recommend this one just as much as the first.",Kim
9780316077040,"After the pleasing end of Beautiful Creatures I was eager to read Beautiful Darkness immediately to remain in the diverse Caster universe and don't quit my quality time with Ethan yet. But I also feared the looming conflict between Lena and Ethan growing to a concrete, which is, as Beautiful Darkness is the second book in a quartet, almost inevitable to provide the structure of an overall suspense curve. Where other novels exercise the obligatory separation of our couple by keeping them away from each other completely, Ethan and Lena still got a kind of psychical connection and are only physically separated. So the importance of Ethan and Lena's psychical bond is once again accentuated. I am looking forward to learn more about their special connection in the next two books. As in Beautiful Creatures, the story is told from Ethan Wate's point of view whose character is as adorable and charming as in the first Caster Chronicles novel. There are very few male narrators in YA fantasy novels, because female authors often tend to apply female narrators I think. Although Lena's development and her decisions around becoming a light or dark Caster form the centre of the Caster Chronicles series, the story is told from Ethan's point of view. In my opinion this choice of perspective is the best the authors could have applied, because experiencing Lena through the eyes of Ethan, and so someone who loves her and cares about her fate, establishes a very intense connection with her although she isn't our narrator and supports the mysterious atmosphere of the whole story. Interesting about Beautiful Darkness is, that we see the happenings through Ethan's eyes, but are at the same time accomplice with Lena. Keeping a secret from Ethan almost broke my heart. In Beautiful Creatures there was a particular short chapter, told from Lena's point of view and I haven't read a novel before in which a single chapter of the first novel has such an enormous impact on its sequel. The conflict grows slowly but steadily and the secrets kept accumulate into an adventurous race for life or death. Various plot strands build a delicately branched web of an unforeseeable suspense you can't but get caught in. In the end there seem to be many secrets unsolved and still a gigantic potential left. Not only main characters show major changes, secondary characters, too. Characters being cold and resistant before finally show feelings, evil and cruel characters become even crueller. Also many new characters are introduced. Some are new allies, friendly and light, others are even darker than the already established Beautiful Creatures villains. A satisfying sequel to Beautiful Creatures, full of all-consuming emotions, inevitable decisions and unforeseeable outcomings. Do you already feel the beautiful darkness creeping into your heart? THE VERDICT Again, a beautifully written novel by the talented casters Garcia and Stohl. They once again proof their talent to apply witty elements and develop an extensive storyline by creating an universe of a novel which is as huge and infinite as the Caster sky itself. And as many constellations there are to spot, there are just as many opportunities for exciting and new story elements, special abilities and characters. New fantasy elements meet solid writing style- The Caster world fills the gap between werewolves and vampires, faeries and magicians and leaves an urgent need for more.",MissPageTurner
9781442421769,"I went into book knowing not a whole lot except Mara was a good character and this book was highly recommended and well reviewed. I came away from this book knowing being in Mara's head is an adventure I will not soon forget. Michelle writing was great and I was constantly guessing what was going on. I didn't know if Mara was crazy if there was some paranormal aspect that I didn't know about or some other explanation. (Again, didn't look at genre and that just made it even more of an adventure.) I was confused at times, shocked at others, creeped out at spots and wondering about Mara but one thing I knew is: I didn't want to put down the book. I had to get to the bottom of what happened and what was going on. I also couldn't get enough of the enigma that was Noah. Every time I thought I had figured him out, he would do something else that had me questioning again. But like Mara, I had to have more. Even knowing his bad boy personality and reputation, I couldn't look away. There were some breathtaking and hot scenes and I loved watching their banter and the chemistry. I guess that I didn't rate this book higher since I was glued to the pages is because I am still confused. I will continue with the series at some point I am sure, but I still don't really understand exactly what was what, and what happened in this one.

9781442421769,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Why did I wait so freaking long to read this?! I was wanting to read this book before it came out, but my library didn't get it in until December. December! It has already been out for nearly four months! This book was so amazing, that I really want to go back and read it already. It's sitting beside me calling my name, begging me to re-read it. To be honest, the first thing that drew me in was the enticing cover. I saw the cool watery widget on everyone's sidebars counting down to it's release. I was memorized and immediately looked it up on Goodreads. The summary sounded amazing and the trailer really drew me in. And still, even though I knew that it was going to be good, I didn't realize fully HOW amazing. Everything was amazing; the writing, the characters, the STORY, the mystery. It was all so twisted. I was a little intimidated at first because I hadn't read such a big book in a while because I had been in a reading funk, but I read it faster than I have with books three times as small! I started it on Saturday and finished on Monday. Pages after pages and chapters after chapters just flew by until I realized, ""Hey, I only have a little over a hundred pages left."" I think the only thing I had a problem with was what the heck happened to Jaimi? I really thought he'd make it to a regular character, but somehow he slipped through the cracks and just...disappeared. Poof! Something happens with him (Not saying what.) and he's gone. And I really liked him. But, if I'm being honest, Noah kind of made up for it. Seriously. He's very swoon worthy. He's definitely my favorite character. Oh, and I don't normally do this, but I put an index card to mark one of my favorite scenes with him. It was absolutely hilarious! I have to share! Noah flashed flashed her a brilliant smile as he dragged a stool to the center of the room. ""Definitely,"" he said. He sat down, and I looked at my blank page, feeling the pressure of his eyes on me the entire time. ""Um, wait--""the sub said, a note of desperation in her voice. My eyes flitted up to the front of the classroom. Noah was in the process of unbuttoning his shirt. Sweet Jesus. ""I'm really not comfortable with--"" He pulled his tie lose. My female classmates tittered. ""Ohmigod!"" ""Holy hell."" ""Hot. So hot."" He lifted the hem of his T-shirt up. Good-bye, dignity. If Noah heard the girls, he made no indication. He caught my stare and shot me a sly smile."" Who wouldn't want to be in THAT art class. He could be my model any day. ;) (I hope my husband doesn't read this...Oops.) Overall, this book was amazing. I need the sequel now. I think I'd sell my soul for it. Some parts kind of confused me in this book, but it's meant to. I think everything will be more revealed in the sequel. If you aren't reading this book because of the hype, don't worry about the hype. Just read it. Seriously. You'll be thanking me later for it. I'm already hating myself for not reading it the very second it came out.",Amanda

9781442421769,"DARCUS' RATING: 5 stars. This was one of those book that caught my attention as soon as I saw it being reviewed on another blog. It was the cover that initially caught my interest at first. It's a very beautiful, haunting cover that draws you in and makes you wonder what the couple's story is. Also, I should mention that the new paper that Simon & Schuster uses for the jacket feels so awesome. If you've felt the cover of Wildefire by Karsten Knight, then you know what I'm talking about. Same kind of paper. Feels like heaven on your fingertips. The book itself was absolutely amazing. I couldn't get enough of it and I finished it quicker than I normally do when I read a book. It was haunting and drew you in like crazy. There were twists and turns and you never really knew what was going on. But in a good way that makes you want to read more and figure out what the heck is happening to Mara, and then later, what the deal is with Noah. Mara Dyer's story is creepy and, if these things were to happen to me, I would probably go insane. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of dark YA. I'm forcing my husband to read it after he finishes his current book, and you should too. - JESS' RATING: 5 stars *this review contains spoilers* What I liked most about this book was the fact that even though it was written for teenagers, the vocabulary was not dumbed down. It was excellently written and it had a plot line that was not the same as most teen books. Yes there was the average drama of high school romance but it had a twist with it. I was not expecting it to turn out the way it did. For every mystery/thriller book I have read the characteristics' Mara displayed were often ones that when the curtain was revealed, it was her doing the killing or hurting people under the guise of her mind giving her freaky powers. I am still very curious as to how she got those power's though. I know even in the book both her and the other character Noah have those unique abilities and neither know why. There are no hints, they just are there. Keeping the reader on the edge of their seat as they hurriedly turn page after page in an attempt to unravel this mystery. It had an awesome ending. One I applaud the writer for because that was like a soccer punch to the face, you did not see it coming but man it left an impact.

9781607068181,"This is an excellent volume. There is a buzz, a tingle in the air. The excitement of a plan coming together. As the communities prepare to stand together there is a gripping tension that pervades this volume. There are still some nice character touches and the reappearance of someone you may have forgotten about. Kirkman doesn??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????C/??t do what you expect which is why after all this time The Walking Dead still seems fresh and novel. The art is great and there is the return of the double page spread, one of which is a classic rug-pull. The character expressions are wonderful and there are some really nice close-ups. A great volume that uses tension masterfully and makes you cling on for dear life until the next book. Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels

He soon learns that his caretaker uncle, Ian Rider, was killed in an automobile accident on his way home. A banker who works for Royal & General, Alex's uncle was a fine man who wasn't home much--but he's still devastated by his death. Except the appearance of some strange people who claim to be his uncle's co-workers, a gun-toting man at his uncle's funeral, and the findings of his uncle's bullet-ridden car make Alex think that there's more than meets the eye to the ""automobile accident"" story. Alex soons find out that his Uncle Ian's life, at least where he himself was concerned, was based on a lie. Ian Rider was a spy, employed by the Special Operations Divison of MI6. And the last case he was working on, concerning multi-millionaire Herod Sayle, was a case that got Ian Rider killed. Now Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Jones, head of SOD, want Alex to pick up where his uncle, their operative, left off--infiltrate the compound where Herod Sayle is building his new Stormbreaker computers, and find out what Ian Rider had to die for. What follows is an action-packed story of danger, bullets, viruses, and out-and-out excitement. At fourteen, Alex is savvy, trained in martial arts, can speak multiple languages, and is, in fact, a truly bliddy good spy! Anthony Horowitz has devised a real winner with Alex Rider and his new career (although he was actually forced into working for MI6), and I can't wait to read the next book in the series and see what mission Alex will be sent on next!",TeensReadToo
9780805094602,"A sequel is always tricky, especially when it follows after a book you loved. As excited as I was for Siege & Storm, I was a bit anxious as well, after how much I loved Shadow & Bone I wasn't sure how this sequel would compare. And I think the simplest way to explain my feelings about Siege & Storm was that I couldn't love it as much as Shadow & Bone. I think it's the kind of book I would have loved so much more on its own, had there not been this incredible first book setting the stage. While Siege & Storm is a good book with some great additions to The Grisha trilogy, you can tell that this is the ""growing pains"" book where the characters have to adjust to a situation none expected nor wanted. Reasons to Read: 1. Fantastic new character additions: This was the absolute best part of Siege & Storm for me: I know, I know. Everyone and their mother loves Sturmhond. But it's for good reason! Leigh's writing gives him a voice that stands out so much from other characters, with his clever comebacks and dry wit. He definitely helps balance out some of the more depressing issues at hand in the story, because when things get REALLY bad? Sometimes you just need to laugh. Or, if you're Stumhond, smirk. 2. Emphasis on Alina's internal struggle: For a book that has had so much attention on developing the setting and world of the story, I'm amazed by how much detail is given to Alina's internal struggle as she tries to adapt to her new powers and position. It seems to me that this is truly the most important conflict in the book - moreso than anything with any other character, even the Darkling. Alina's battle isn't with some external force, it's with herself. It's such an introspective story, one where it is truly a privilege to be so in tune with Alina's thoughts and feelings because she doesn't share them with anyone else. 3. An expanded setting: When Siege & Storm starts off, we have Alina and Mal on the run in an entirely different country. They end up meeting a number of other characters from other places as well, and we finally get a bit more of a glimpse at the rest of the world. To me, this is what makes a setting believable and come to life - hints that the world is still turning outside of the main characters' location. I really like that, and I think it helps build the plot and help the reader understand exactly what is at stake here. The biggest problem for me? So very little happens, and what does happen occurs very quickly. The action feels rushed, and the waiting seems to go on forever. It's a slow book, and I mentioned how introspective and sensitive to Alina's conflict with herself the book is. While that is a good thing, it also means other parts of the story suffer as a result of so much time and focus spent on Alina. Much of the time is spent waiting for something to happen, and I understand that part of this is simply because Alina (and company) are acting defensively. After Shadow & Bone featured SO MUCH (so much action, so much romance, so much creepiness) I was hoping for more, and I think my expectations are mostly to blame here. But we still have an excellent book here. Leigh Bardugo's writing is as exceptional as ever, and I think really showcases her knack for juggling a multitude of character voices and emotions. She is truly a master at tugging at her readers' heartstrings, and never leaves us with predictable characters or story lines. Although the romance is left on the back burner for most of this book, the tension is incredible and I appreciate that it didn't overshadow the rest of the story.

Three pages in and wow... this book is so different from what I expected The characters and storyline was unpredictable and very different. In fact my expectations was browned away as the book was everything I didn't expect! There are some really awesome messages in this book and even though some scenario's could have been handled differently/avoided, they were there for a good reason. I love this book! Its worth the hype! Love Hate relationship is becoming one of my new favorite types of romance. Definitely check this out for a breath of fresh air in YA Contemporary and get ready to be blown away by the unique writing style and characters of Koby Keplinger. Also I read this in two sitting so check it our if you want a quick light reads.",Rou Min Tan
9780316084246,"Somehow, I am oddly drawn by books that have female protagonists with a sharp tongue. They're haters, they complain about those around her and bottom line... She doesn't stick around people who are intolerable to her. Though these qualities can be very discouraging in real life. But in a book, the authors always make them not so bad and not so good. A combination that is almost too perfect that one can't help but keep on reading. Bianca Piper is that cynical protagonist I'm raving about. Bianca Piper is the DUFF amongst her two best friend. The DUFF can be defined as a friend amongst a closed circle of girls who are so pretty that they over shadow this DUFF, or in full form, The Designated Ugly Fat Friend. It's a mean term but it's a term that is actually used in real life. Surprising enough, her friends are not dense air heads who only think about boys, popularity and being beautiful. Her friends Jessica and Casey are the sweetest bunch ever. This is a definite plus for me. The book started off really quick two to three chapters and you will be hooked. I loved how fast-paced the book was, I loved it even more when it drove me off the railings here and there. Bianca is one impulsive girl and she will drive you nuts in a good way. I've read a lot of teen books and by far, the realistic romances are my favorites. And The Duff definitely has this. Though Bianca might be using her romance with the schools playboy as a way to escape real life, I can't help but rave about that too. I am so impressed with the authors writing style, she was 18 when she wrote this book and I adored her concept, characters and everything else that came along with the book. Only thing I would change about the book was how abruptly it ended. Maybe if that part was less predictable and more smooth, the book would have been even more amazing. Everything else about this book was absolutely addicting! I simply couldn't put it down. If I had the time and patience to read a book twice, I would do it starting with The DUFF.",Najla Qamber
9780316084246,"The Designated Ugly Fat Friend. Hands up if you've ever felt like that might be you? I certainly need to raise my own hand in response and I bet a whole bunch of readers just did the same. I can't say how it is for guys, but I think a lot of us ladies often feel like the Duff of the group. Every single one of us will, at some point, have looked at our friends and been absolutely positive that they only invite us along out of some kind of pity. We might look at our pals and feel ugly or fat or frumpy in comparison to their svelte beauty. I truly liked The Duff. I enjoyed how the characters were flawed. I liked how the subject matter was not dumbed down for the YA audience. I think that most of all, I loved how Keplinger breathed some new life into the now horribly clichÂ©ï¸d idea of the love triangle. Bianca was a pain in the ass at times and the narrator's voice exacerbated this as far as I was concerned. Wesley was a womanising git who will remind you of ""those"" boys in school. You know who I mean? The boys who wore to much boy-scented aftershave, walked with a swagger and never had anything nice to say to any girl who hadn't been on birth control since they were still in footsy-pyjamas!? Then there was Toby. He was so nice that it was almost annoying. I knew that I should want Toby to swoop in and save the day with all of his gentle, unsure geekiness, but I didn't! Wesley and Bianca's banter was hilarious. They both used each other but in doing so, they found equals. They challenged and changed each other. I liked the friendship between Bianca and her best pals. This friendship was also flawed but sweet. I don't think it was as real as it was, perhaps, a little bit too forgiving and not snarky enough...but then that probably means I just have a lot of snarky pals! Whereas I liked the friends, Bianca's family irritated the crap out of me. Her mother escaped through work; her father escaped through booze... is it any wonder that Bianca searches for her own ways to escape? With all of the irritations and imperfections, I still loved this book. The language is coarse but the sexual subject matter is not glamorised. Bianca feels dirty and ashamed of herself after her nights with Wesley, but still, this is a book which I doubt many parents would be comfortable with younger teens reading.",Laura Williams
9780062235671,"I am completely in love with Kasie West and her ability to write the most adorable stories. So far I have loved every single one of the books she has ever put out. So I was beyond curious to see if she would do it again, and she totally did! On The Fence delivered. It was a cute story that went beyond fluffy, summery writing but still didn't take itself too seriously. It featured West's now signature style of amazing, relatable heroines and a supporting cast that was more than just added secondary characters, to the point that you learned everyone's name and cared for their individual stories. I loved Charlie. She was the strongest of the whole book to me, just so easy to like and her point of view made the book completely captivating and hilarious. I loved the dynamics between her and her brothers. They made one of the cutest sibling relationships I have ever read. And I love that Charlie was going through a lot of self doubt but she was still confident in what she loved, like sports and hanging out with the guys and not one of those insecure, whiny girls that wonder why the world doesn't love them. She definitely strung at my heart cords because I have also felt insecure about how I look, much like her I am tall and even though I am no jock I hit the gym often and I sometimes feel so big standing beside all my petite friends; and all this only made me feel more connected to her and her story. And I loved each of her brothers and their different personalities too. And of course her dad was a sweetheart so I loved each time he awkwardly tried to teach Charlie any girl stuff, it was hysterical. And don't get me started on Braden, who was just so perfect with how he wanted Charlie to be with someone who appreciated who she really was. Le sigh. The story with Charlie's mom was an unexpected depth that added a lot to an otherwise cute story, I really liked that. But don't think this book isn't hilarious too, it is! It has been reaffirmed that West has joined my list of Contemporary queens. Loved it.",melannie
9780062235671,"I received an ARC of On the Fence from Harper Teen Australia, this in no way influenced my review. First Line: a??The engine whined against my attempt to go faster.a?? I had never read a Kasie West book before I picked up On the Fence and I am hating myself for not doing it before. She is such an amazing writer, captures emotions so well. Charlie is a tomboy, there is no denying it. She doesna??t wear makeup, she dresses without much care and she hangs out with boys and, you know what, I loved her. Ita??s rare that I read a book with a girl protagonist that isna??t worried about what she wears, or if she is wearing makeup. It was different, but nice. I loved the writing style of Kasie West. It was interesting and it intrigued me to keep on reading. The book started off with a bang and just kept on getting better and better as it went on. I thought it was be a sappy contemporary romance instead novel, but it was so much more. It turned into a mystery novel somehow, it was so good. Yes, there were still those snappy romance moments, but it made them so much more glorious. I loved Charliea??s brothers. Yes, they may have been over protective, but, once you find out why, you kind of understand why they were protective. Each one of them were from the other, but they all related to Charlie in some way. It was different seeing sibling interaction, as again in YA there isna??t much of yet when there is they arena??t the best relationships. So it was nice seeing good sibling relationships. She even had a pretty okay relationship with her father. I didna??t mind her father at all. Yes, he was a little strict, but I can again understand why. I normally dona??t like parents all that much in Young Adult books, so that is another thumbs up to Kasie. Branden, he is just amazing and not to mention the boy next door. Charlie and Brandena??s a??Fencea?? moments were just so cute and moving and heartbreaking. Just everything all at once. On the Fence was funny and cute as well as very moving. Charlie struggles the whole book with the death of her mother and she doesna??t know how to be a a??girl.a?? She cana??t get over her mothera??s death and as the book goes on we see why. On the Fence reminded me a lot of Pushing the Limits by Katie McGarry in the sense of suppressed memories. Which intrigued me a lot. Ita??s an interesting concept that no matter how many times ita??s done it always seem different. I laughed, I cried and I swooned. On the Fence was simply just gorgeous. Kasiea??s writing is brilliant and beautiful. It was entertaining and the banter between Charlie and her brothers and Charlie and Braden just added so much to the book. The heart-warming family moments also added so much depth to the book. The romance between Charlie and Braden was simply beautiful--the true nature of friends becoming more. They were totally adorable together and the scenes on the fence were just so brilliant. Over all On the Fence is a book of self-discovery, love, friendship and family. The tales of a girl becoming a a??girla??, finding love and friendship. On the Fence is mesmerizing, moving and funny",Angelique
9780062235671,"I wanted to read On The Fence because I was in the need for a summery read plus the fact that I have liked Kasie West's characters and writing style from her paranormal books. The dynamic between Charlie, our tomboy main character and her brothers is so endearing. They are like an amoeba, where one is, you'll find the rest. They have folded into their circle of boyhood, wrestling with her, playing sports no holds barred with her, and letting her be with them all the time. Part of this group of guys is next door neighbor Braden, who is an only child and loves the inclusion. He has a dad who he dubs jerk and him getting out of the house when dear dad comes home drunk is what leads him to be out so late at night to begin the fence talks with Charlie. And yes, we can all see where this is going. But I liked how they had a friendship first, and they were aware that if things changed, it would effect more than herself. But I like that as they have the deep conversations at night, she is working out things about herself and her mom who died when she was little. They have this deeper connection and it makes me smile. Charlie's dad was also present. He was awkward a lot of the time, but he was at least trying. Red in the face talking about conditioner and bras, doing what men shouldn't have to do. I also like that he was in on some of the nerf action. Speaking of, I love the playful nature of the house. That and how the dares kept things adventurous and deepened their bonds. Through her job she is also getting in touch with parts of herself that she didn't before. That she could be a little girly and it wouldn't be the end of the world. What I think the most important message was though is how she learned to be herself. That she could be girly or wear makeup if she wanted, but that she shouldn't have to be fake or only show half of who she was in order to be liked. The light nature to the book was also good. Because even though it had some rough subject matter--drunk dads and dead moms--it was dealt with and still managed to focus on the now. Being able to push through, showing your strength and at the same time vulnerability to open up to someone else and share feelings, to lean on them and to get through. The ending was sweet and nice, but I couldn't help putting down the book and wanting to get more time in their chemistry, in the sureity of their relationship, with others knowing, with their hearts a little less confused. Bottom Line: Fun, fast and light with slow romance that was sweet.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780062235671,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins and Edelweiss.) 16-year-old Charlie is a girl, but growing up with her father and three brothers, she acts more like a boy. When she's forced to get a job at a clothes store, she finally starts acting more like a girl. Will Charlie ever wise up to being a girl? And can anyone ever be interested in a tomboy? This was an okay story, but the main character annoyed me, and the story dragged. Charlie was just such a tomboy it was ridiculous! I got that she'd been raised by her father and three older brothers, but she acted like she was the only girl on the planet! How dense do you have to be to have not noticed TV adverts about hair conditioner? And did she have no female friends at all? She acted like a boy, she thought like a boy, and she was totally, 100% clueless. The storyline in this was okay, but it did start to drag after a while. Charlie carried on doing what she was doing, totally oblivious to everything around her, and even when you thought she might have eventually caught-on, she did something totally clueless again. Even though she acted like a boy, it wouldn't hurt her to wear something without mud on it for once. There was some romance, but I ended up getting annoyed with that too. I waited patiently for Charlie to catch on that a certain someone liked her, and then when she finally did, and said something to him about it, he denied that he liked her! So much so, that I began to wonder what the heck was going on! Then we got one of the oldest tricks ever happening - as soon as Charlie started dating someone else, her original crush decided he was jealous, and wanted her after all. Talk about frustrating! The ending was okay, and I was pleased that we got a happy ending; it would have been nice if the journey there had been a little less frustrating though. Overall; okay story, but Charlie was just clueless, 6 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781622660759,"Favourite Quote: ""Luc set the box of doughnuts down, and I eyed them like they held the answer to life."" Wow. This is the only word I could think of after finishing this book! It was a crazy journey with so many twists and turns including betrayels,d eaths and a complete new race! I enjoyed it so much one than Opal and give it a 5/5 stars! Lets start with the plot, there was a lot of information given during the first quarter, all of which is very important and moves the story along! And the new race, such a good addition to the Lux world! There were numerous action-packed scenes that were just incredible and exciting! As for the twists, there were many and I actually only guessed the Beth one, the rest were complete shocks! And that ending, wow, just speechless and I cannot wait for the last book! Then theres the characters, lets start off with the fact that so many of them died! It was insane and I admire Jennifer L.Armentrout for being brave and going through with them all! There werent meaningless to me, infact they made the book more emotional and impacting! Katy and Daemon were awesome as always, bringing in the humour and love that makes this series unique! The rest of the characters were great and I really liked Archer the new character! Overall this book was awesome and I cannot recommend this series highly enough!",brookexx
9781622660759,"This is one of those series that keeps getting better with each new instalment. In Origin, Katy finds herself captured by the Daedalus and all her worst nightmares come true. Even hearing about what happened to Dawson and Bethany didn't really prepare Katy for what life as captive hybrid would bring. And then there's Daemon. Nothing on Earth - or even on an alien planet - could stop him from saving the girl he loves. For all those Daemon fans - I think he really shines in this one. He's arrogant, sarcastic but willing to give up everything for Katy. The snarky sarcastic conversations he has were a highlight for me. I love the way Katy and Daemon interact and I'm really rooting for this pair as a couple! In many ways Origin is a turning point in the series. The first three books were mostly about the love story and the action was secondary. But now things have changed. Don't worry - there's still plenty of fluffy tenderness between the leading pair but the war between our favourite Luxens and the world... it's only just getting started. The dual point-of-view between Katy and Daemon helps bring the urgency of their situation to light. I loved getting to see how Daemon felt about Katy from his eyes and I think this is part of the reason why I'm behind them romantically. They're growing up and it's clear to see that Katy isn't the same girl she was at the start of Obsidian. She's seen the worst life has to offer but she's stronger than I ever expected. I loved the action in this book. Things are happening and they're happening FAST! Some brilliant new characters are introduced (I want to know more about Archer!) and some old ones reappear. There's a cameo appearance of Hunter and Serena from Obsession (JLA's adult paranormal romance novel that's set in the same universe as the Lux novel). Armentrout isn't afraid to put her characters though hell and I respect her for that. For all the fans who have been eagerly anticipating Origin since the cliff-hanger at the end of Opal - I think you'll be satisfied and impressed with how things unfold in Origin. This book is exciting, cheeky and romantic. My favourite from this series by far.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9781622660759,"I love everything that she writes, and Origin was no exception. I loved being back with Katy and Daemon, in their heads, in their world, and wrapped up in their steamy and devoted relationships. Though it was hard because for part of this one, they are separated. Katy sees and endures some pretty horrific things while captured, and shocking truths about the world she thought she understood. There are some very touching moments, some hot ones between the two, some very intriguing new characters, surprising twists in the plot, and of course some action. There is the usual snark thrown in and I really can't say a lot without spoilers, but if you haven't started this series, I would get on it pronto. I didn't think I would like an alien story but I have fallen head over heels for this world and these characters. The ending as usual left me open mouthed and wishing that I had Jennifer's computer so I could read the next book NOW, because I have to know more.

9781620100004,"Reason for Reading: I've really paid no attention to the hype about this series, never seen the movie, nor do I know what it's even about. But I did intend to give it a try someday, seeing as the author is Canadian and since I had the chance decided now was the time. I didn't *love* this and at first wasn't even all that lukewarm to it either but as the book progressed I became more interested in Scott and then eventually Ramona, until at the end I knew I would read the next book. I was put off with all the h*m*s*xual references and jokes. Is that all a gay character is for? Of course, the lifestyle of these 23-25 year olds was not what I would call edifying either. The publisher recommends this for ages 13+ but I personally give it a recommended 18+. Any 13 year old of mine won't be reading about young 20 year olds going to bed with each other. There is one highschool student in the book (a 17yo) but she is brought into the college/young adult world. Not a book for children, imho. Once I got over this stuff, and got used to it, as I did think this was going to be a book about and for highschoolers, I found myself getting attached to Scott Pilgrim and several of the other characters such as Kim and Ramona at this point. The story is quite out there with a video game theme whereby Scott has to defeat Ramona's past 7 evil boyfriends to win the right to date her. In fact there is a lot of little bitty ""out there"" references that are made and plot points that happen so the reader, especially this one, became more and more intrigued the further she reads on. When I first started, I couldn't see myself really liking this book, but now that I'm finished I certainly want to read next book! The colour was nice but I don't want to wait that long to read them all so I will continue on with the black & white editions.",Nicola Mansfield
9780141326092,"Frankly speaking, I found the first book (Beautiful Creatures, now, a big movie franchise) too much of a drag to read mainly because of how prolonging it was. I wasn't planning on reading or listening to the rest of the series anytime soon. But thanks to my eldest sister's audiobook, I managed to finish it within 3 days. Best thing about this is that I get to listen to it while I worked. I call it 'double productivity' and with that double productivity, I actually grew to love the series! When the book started, I groaned and I did it because the author(s) reuses the same plot from the first book and renames it 17th Moon instead of 16th Moon. Then they begin to write circles and differences around it. But you've got to hand it to them, they did write a damn good book! Ethan (the main character) is a sweetheart and in this installment, the poor guy goes through heaven and hell for Lena (his female counter part). Man, I hate Lena. She's such a victim I can't stand. Even worse are the decisions that she makes, and the fact that she completely doesn't confide in Ethan, like they used to, makes me groan some more! I even rolled my eyes at her a couple of times. I am so happy I don't have to deal with her as the main character. I wouldn't want to get stuck in that head of hers. In the end, my favorite character is Link (Ethan's lame best friend) instead of Ethan. He's one of those dorky characters that will make you cry and laugh at the same time. He can even be considered as the ""Ron Weasley"" of the whole series. He is very much linked to the end of this installment that will literally blow your mind with it's awesomeness! Likewise, we've got the adversaries of Ethan and his gang. The mastermind of the whole evilness reminds me too much of the bad guy in The Hunger Games. But then again, nothing is really new out there. Now, for the beautiful yet gothic land of Gaitlin, South Carolina. So dark, so mystical. I just want to move into this fictional town and spend the rest of my life doing the things I love with the people I love. Of course, I'll only live there if the fictional characters of Gaitlin weren't. If you dislike the characters, you sure won't dislike the town they live in (minus the people). Gaitlin isn't just a home for humans but also Witches or Casters as they like to be called. The world Stohl and Garcia creates for the Casters is so dark and haunting, you can't help but call it beautiful. Undoubtedly, I adored the book. The writing style is flat out written for not only the teens but for mothers, fathers, older brothers, etc. Some characters will surely keep you glued to the book while the storyline remains with the same foundation but still has the ability to keep the reader going, and most importantly, the book encompasses the Beautiful Darkness that continues to draw me even closer to the characters and overall, to the entire series. And with that, I quickly moved to the 3rd book and I'm half way done with the book!",Najla Qamber

Her quest gets her deeper and deeper into the Darkling's mind causing her to become more aware of him and his powers. In this epic conclusion, find out if Alina has what it takes to bring Ravka back from the Darkling's true clutches. I almost forgot most of the characters in this book so I had trouble remembering who was who. But with the recaptains posts I was brought up to date and remembering what happened came back. So thank you ladies for that post. There's a rare occurrence that happened to me in this book. I didn't care which boy Alina would end up with because in some form I liked them all. They were all so different and likable. Even the fact that some were more so evil than others, I still liked the Darkling. He has such a fascinating history and I would love nothing more than to read his back story. I felt some spark for all three of them and I just wanted her to pick them all. The feels were all felt in this one. And when I say feels, I meant tears. I teared in this one because of the raw emotion I felt reading it. Oh that scene.. Bless my heart, I had to take a moment to bask in my emotions. Ahhhh. And did I mention that Leigh brought all the punches and turns and twists? Yep she did, and brought you to the brink. She also ended it so beautifully. I don't think I'd change a thing about this book because it had perfect pacing, tone, plot and character development. Overall, you NEED to get on this trilogy if you haven't read it yet. A beautiful, heart breaking and wonderful ending, I will gladly re-read this series over and over again. Truly one of my favourite fantasy series' of all time.",Giselle SM
9780763655594,"A 13-year-old boy is dealing with the terminal illness of his single mother. He has nightmares almost every night, is a loner at school, is bullied by one boy in particular and one night begin the visitations of a monster at 12:07. The story deals with the normal emotions of a child dealing with the imminent death of a parent: grief, anger, etc. and the mystical world of the nightmares and the monster symbolize things the boy can't verbalize or rationalize himself otherwise. This is a dark story but with a redeeming ending. Don't let the fact that it is an illustrated book fool you into thinking the book is suitable for young children. It is definitely a YA title, dealing with some tough emotions, dark situations, frightening scenes and emotionally draining. I lost my mother to terminal illness at age 24 and the deathbed scene brought tears to my eyes. A powerful, haunting and gut-wrenching story. The book is profusely illustrated in a very dark manner. With what appears to be black ink throughout, some illustrations are mostly dark texturized blackness with no focal image while others are quite outstanding haunting images featuring the monster. On their own I'm not sure I would appreciate them but they are a perfect match for the story being told. This is a book I wouldn't be surprised to see on award lists.",Nicola Mansfield

9780525423270,"Writing this review may be one of the hardest things in the world because... how do you gush and still sound original when the whole rest of the world has read and loved this book? Their reviews are no doubt much more eloquent than mine. Basically, the following is the result of reading this book is me melting into a puddle of goo. This book is straight up romance but it is of the highest quality and hard to resist. Slow build up? Check. Swoon-worthy boy? MEGA check. Get me an Etienne... NOW! Irresistibly adorable dialogue? Check. A romance that develops from the best kind of pure-hearted friendship? Check. If this doesn't make your heart melt, I don't know what's wrong with you. That being said, the pacing was frustrating at times, in the best possible way. The build up is so gradual but intense, you can't help but get severely emotionally invested in the story. It was one of the really rare instances where I totally lost track of time and page number as I was reading, and suddenly it was 2 am. I forced myself to stop, to keep a normal sleep pattern, but I was immensely frustrated and frantically motioning... NOW KISS. Little did I know I literally stopped reading at the chapter of the first kiss. Sigh. The depiction of Paris also pretty much stole my heart. I'm in love with the city, and the descriptions were really fitting. I felt like I was back there, pretty much. And it does give my next trip to Paris a sense of urgency. It's been too long! The only thing that made me enjoy this book a little less and keeps me from giving it the full five oranges is the stereotyping and the cliches. There's Amanda, the typical mean girl - and that's about it. That's completely who she is. I just rolled my eyes at her and I wished her character had some more realism or depth. Anna's best friend, Bridget, stealing her crush. Sigh. But I also sometimes disliked Anna and her attitude. She was pretty self-centered at times, and though I realize that was part of her character, and at the end she grew and changed, it was deeply irritating. Summing Up... I really, truly, thoroughly enjoyed this novel because it was exactly what I needed right now. Romance may be a bit more on my mind at the moment *cough* It was adorable, fluffy, and super lovable. If you haven't read it, definitely check it out when you're in the mood for some romance that will melt your heart. Although I'm pretty sure I'm the last person on Earth to read this. I hope you won't all defriend me because I didn't give it 5 oranges. Please? Recommended To... Any and all fans of straight up romance.",Unknown
9780525423270,"When I started reading this book, I already had high expectations of it. I've heard so many great things about it! And while I read it, I was not disappointed. I could not stop thinking about the characters that I was reading in the book all day long, daydreaming about them and what would they do if they were in crazy situations that I created in my head. You can always tell that a novel is good when you can't disconnect from it. Also, Anna and Etienne are probably the cutest couple ever! They're so sweet together, the way they treated each other and the way that the love grew to happen in this book was perfect. I was delighted probably around 99% of the time I was reading it. Besides, there were a lot of moments of the book that I just had to put it down for a second, just to squeal with happiness at the cuteness of one scene or some flirting between them. God, I was needing a sweet novel like this one. Also, I found it completely impossible not to fall in love with Etienne St. Clair. The english accent, the knowing fluent french, the hair, the smile, the confidence, the way he treated Anna, the way he felt about his mom... This guy is perfect and no one could ever prove me wrong in this. Also, the character building that happens in the book is really something. Anna grows up so much from the first to the last page! And she doesn't even realize it. People actually have to point that out to her. And this was very human of the author to do. A normal person just don't keep track of how much they grow up (mentally speaking)! And then we watch (or better, read) her go from this scared, lonely little girl to a strong, independent young woman through the course of a school year. How she comes to make piece with things that were out of her control and got to solve problems that earlier seemed so, so big and scary. Way to go, Stephanie Perkins! Concluding, I completely adored this book, it was definitely one of the best books that I read in 2013, and I really don't know why I waited so long to get to it. Amazing, delightful, delicious, and so many other things. Great, great read.",Manoela Paz

9780525423270,"Let me begin by saying that this is almost as close to the perfect romance as you can get. I absolutely loved the book, and it was one of those books I did not want to put down. I was completely enchanted by the story line, the romance, and the delicious humor. I would never call this cheesy nor sappy, but if it is, it is the kind I love! Anna was a wonderful character, but it gets no better than Etienne St. Clair! Having had an English friend in the past, I was intrigued to see how much St. Clair was like this friend of mine. I loved the British mannerisms, terminology, and more. And yes, I know that St. Clair was not truly British, but in so many ways he was! I was enchanted by the humor. So often the books that I read miss the element of humor, but this book had me laughing out loud at many times, but there were times that the tears threatened to come as well. Stephanie Perkins is a master at writing emotion--period. There was only one thing I didn't like. Profanity in the book did not show up until much later into the book, and although the profanity was not prolific, I did not feel it was necessary. Thankfully there were no bedroom scenes. Yes, there were some sexual terms that were dropped here and there, but I was not overly offended. I am glad that Anna was a virgin--always appreciate this in books! I would love to read a sequel to this book, and maybe one day, Stephanie will do that for us. I doubt I am alone in wishing to see the saga of Anna and St. Clair continue. This was a nice romance, and at the end I actually experienced chills it was so good! If you have not read this book, and you like romances of any kind, this is the book for you!",Ruth Hill
9780525423270,"Originally published at <a href=""http://wingedreviews.com/2012/03/anna-and-the-french-kiss-by-stephanie-perkins/"">Winged Reviews</a>. Anna and the French Kiss is a breath of fresh air. Amidst all of the supernatural, fantasy and mythology based young adult books that seem to be dominating the market, this book is a fun read simply about the wonders of being a teenager in a foreign city. Anna has been sent to a boarding school in Paris by her mainly absent father. Initially upset at leaving her best friend, her younger brother and a potential boyfriend, Anna eventually finds herself in a new circle of friends which includes the charming Etienne St. Clair. In the backdrop of this magnificent city, the budding film critic finds herself awed, confused and eventually in love. The book flowed very naturally and Anna is a delightful point of view character. Perkins imbues her with charm and wit, while keeping her grounded and relatable. Her experiences and reactions come off wholly genuine. Perkins manages to string together a series of almost ordinary events in Anna's life, but keeps everything original and interesting. I empathised and rooted for Anna through every small triumph (movie theatres showing classic films, yes please) and heartache (who here hasn't been hurt by a best friend and that guy). I remember when I was younger, I went abroad to California for a summer course. It was the first time I travelled by myself and I went into the experience with a mixture of dread and excitement. And then I met a boy and those three weeks were my best teenage memories. St. Clair is that boy. He's every high school crush and summer love you've had or never managed to shake. I would've definitely fallen for his cool English accent and his easy way, but liked that he was real enough so I was just as irritated as Anna by his annoying indecisiveness and somewhat weak will. The chemistry between them was palpable and that teenage girl inside me tingled every time they were together, seriously. The beauty of Anna and the French Kiss is that it brought back all the good parts of being a teenager. For anyone who has ever had a first love or a new experience, this book is one for you. I'll definitely come back to it whenever I need to revisit those three weeks in the summer.",Daphne (Winged Reviews)
9780525423270,"Three words I would use to describe this book: Hilarious. Heartwarming. BRILLIANT. I was looking for another 'H' word to summarize it, but brilliant seemed to fit better than anything else - because that's exactly what Stephenie Perkins proved she was by writing this book! Everything about it was just so magical. I've always wanted to go to Paris, and reading this book fueled my desire even more. Perkins has an amazing talent of writing details so that you're always intrigued and never bored. The storyline was perfectly crafted, and the way she wrote such specific aspects about her characters made them that much easier to connect to. Anna was the perfect voice for the novel! Her thoughts were always fun and hilarious to follow; I could always relate to her no matter what she did. And her chemistry with St. Clair stole my breath away every time. They were perfect together. But Perkins didn't just write ""they were perfect together"" - the author showed it through moments that were just as much fun to read as I'm sure they were for Anna to experience. Beautiful, enchanting, and one-hundred percent entertaining, I have to say that Anna and the French Kiss was honestly my favourite contemporary novel of the year! I recommend it wholeheartedly! Stephenie Perkins is definitely an author I'm going to watch out for. :) BUY or BORROW?: This is a contemporary shelf must-have! Buy it and love it and gush about it with me!",Mimi Valentine
9780062085535,"Favourite Quote: C/??HeC/??s standing right in front of me and I miss him like I havenC/??t seen him in years.C/?? This book was soooo good! Do I like it better than the first book? No I donC/??t think so but it was still a brilliant sequel! I give this book 4/5 stars! One thing I will never get over is Tahereh MafiC/??s writing style. It is literally the most beautiful style IC/??ve ever read! ItC/??s just so lyrical and poetic, utterly memorizing. I think this book wad definitely better written than the first and itC/??s a joy to watch Tahereh MafiC/??s writing go from strength to strength! The plot for this book was very fast paced. There were a lot of action scenes and there was also a lot of discoveries made. A couple of the plot twists, I saw coming but there were a few that were a complete surprise to me! The ending was not a cliffhanger thankfully but it successfully set up for the final installment in this trilogy! As for the characters, Juliette and Adam were the reason that stopped me from rating this book a 5/5. Juliette was far too self-pitying in this book, I know she had valid reasons but I find almost every page she was complaining about herself or her future and eventually it started to irritate me! Thankfully nearer the end of the novel, she accepts herself more and I look forward to seeing the C/??newC/?? version of her in the next book. Then thereC/??s Adam who was so melodramatic and attacked like a love sick 13-year-old, he annoyed me in this book and I definitely liked him a lot more in the first book. And then thereC/??s Warner, who grew on me during this book because of all the different sides we saw of him (my favourite was him and the dog) but unlike everyone else, IC/??m not on Team Warner, IC/??m more of Team DonC/??t Know haha! I canC/??t get past some of the things WarnerC/??s done so I donC/??t know if IC/??ll ever end up rooting for him! As for the side characters, I love love love love Kenji. He may be in my favourite fictional characters of all time! There were others I liked such as Brendan, the twins, Castle etc we only saw small pieces of them here and there but I liked them all well enough! I loved hating WarnerC/??s dad, he is literally evil and one of the best dystopian villains ever! Overall this was a great addition to the trilogy and I cannot wait to read the final book!",brookexx
9780062085535,"After being blown away by SHATTER ME, UNRAVEL ME had to live up to the very unique and excellent reading experience Tahereh's debut offered. I'm afraid this sequel didn't overwhelm me quite like the first book. For instance UNRAVEL ME didn't hold the original appeal Tahereh Mafi conjured by making Juliette untouchable in the first place. She isn't entirely inapproachable anymore, so some of this forbidden allure relationships between Juliette and Adam as Juliette and Warner held simply evaporated in the second book. Where things felt almost one hundred percent unpredictable in the first book, they appeared more pre-determined now, Juliette has an idea of what's happening around her and knows what's ahead of her, at least for a few days. In SHATTER ME Juliette was captured, in a prison cell, not knowing what her near feature would hold. Now she's living with a group of specially gifted people who are like her. Much of UNRAVEL ME is about explaining who they and what their talents are, what they are doing as an organization of resistance and exploring their group dynamics. New as old characters were all really great in their own ways and their capacity to infuriate or fascinate you. Adam and Warner continue to compete for Juliette's heart and all Warner fans will get their money's worth, because we learn a lot more about his past and what's on his mind. I admit, he grew a lot on me and I felt acutal sympathy for him - quite a sensation remembering what a monster he acted like in SHATTER ME. What really bothered me were Adam and Juliette distancing themselves from each other, because it could be too dangerous for them to be together.Yawn! I thought we'd already overcome that hurdle. No more of this old game in book three, please! 4,5/5 ****/* UNRAVEL ME - A satisfactory second book in a series with minor romantic deficiencies! Tahereh's language is as beautiful and poetical as always, still Juliette lost a little bit of her sometimes strange and always unique voice that was only hers. Yet there's sure enough action and love to make every reader happy. And the evolvement of Warner's character is a definite and strong plus!",MissPageTurner
9780062085535,"After my excitement for this series had been rekindled by Destroy Me, I was really looking forward to Unravel Me. I was sure my dislike of Shatter Me was a situational thing; I must have disliked it because of the headspace I was in when I read it! And then I realized it wasn't Unravel Me per se that I disliked, but it's heroine; it's pathetically whiney, dependent and frail heroine who showed no little growth since Shatter Me. Before I get into all of the reasons why Juliette has ruined this series for me, I would like to comment on the one thing things I did enjoy in Unravel Me. With its stream of consciousness narration, Unravel Me manages to succeed at being incredibly fast-paced, even though almost nothing is happening during its 400+ pages. I will admit to skimming over most of Juliette's angsty monologues about feeling inadequate, which means I probably skimmed over most of Unravel Me, but thanks to almost nonexistent punctuation in between Juliettes' thoughts, Unravel Me reads surprisingly quickly for its lengthier size. Mafi's prose, while definitely of the purple nature, is also quite pretty even though it rarely makes sense. ""It's the kind of kiss that makes you realize oxygen is overrated."" This is where I almost put the book down. I should have known then, but I was promised a world of delights if I read through until Chapter 62, so I persevered. As for Juliette, I'm going to quote from my review of Shatter Me, since it seems appropriate here: ""For the vast majority of the book, she spends her time crying/trembling/gasping/blushing, all while adamantly refusing to understand how anyone, but especially Adam, could care for her. This type of behaviour I could have forgiven, had she shown any growth. But it wasn't until the last few chapters that she went from being a weak, ridiculously melodramatic and frustratingly insecure protagonist into one with the glimmer of something resembling strength."" It's surprising that I could have written that without my quotation marks, you wouldn't have known it had come from a review of a different book! Juliette has seen absolutely no growth since Shatter Me; the description I posted above is equally as fitting in Unravel Me. You know how I know Juliette is supposed to have grown? Because she tells me so! ""I've come to realize that being away from him has forced me to rely on myself. To allow myself to be scared and to find my own way through it. I've had to train without him, fight without him, face Warner and Anderson and the chaos of my mind all without him by my side. And I feel different now. I feel stronger since putting space between us. And I don't know what that means. All I know is that it'll never be safe for me to rely on someone else again, to need constant reassurance of who I am and who I might someday be. I can love him, but I can't depend on him to be my backbone. I can't be my own person if I constantly require someone else to hold me together."" But guess what she was doing ten pages previous to this enlightenment? Sobbing on her knees, trembling in fright, and relying on someone else to pick her up. I understand that Juliette had a tough childhood. I understand that she was tortured at a young age and that there will be psychological repercussions because of it. I understand that this might lead to moments of confusion/angst/self-pity/etc. But understanding and believing are two different things. I didn't believe that Juliette was acting out of some deep psychological torment when she played mind games with both Adam and Warner. I didn't believe that Juliette thought herself a monster, and that was the reason she was so afraid to learn how to control her abilities. And I didn't believe in her inner strength because every time she was pushed, she fell to the ground, crying. As for chapter 62, I was too distracted by Juliette's complete and utter betrayal to enjoy any of it.",Pretty Little Reader
9780062085535,"When the synopsis says that she has to make some hard choices, it is not exaggerating I thought it was just being fancy, but she is faced with a twist that I didn't see coming. And it makes her have to make choices about love that can kill, or breaking her own heart... and his? I love the first book, and the second doesn't disappoint. We get to see more about Omega Point, and we get more of Kenji, who quickly became one of my favorite secondary characters. In Unravel Me, we see more of the day to day operations and Castle's research. The action is well written and the character development is superb. Juliette learns so much about herself and about stepping up, but she of course is still not perfect. She makes some mistakes that hurt to read about, and she literally couldn't make some of her decisions without hurting someone. Besides the above mentioned twist, there are others that left me reeling. I finally began to see the appeal of Warner to an extent (this part of the review was written before I read Destroy Me) but I still go a little crazy for Adam He makes me happy just how much he adores her and how loyal he is to his family and what he believes in. Speaking of his family--James has grown up a little in this one and he is one of my fave characters besides the obvious choices. Although I still think that Adam is the best for Juliette, I know that between what I have learned in this and Destroy Me, that I don't want Warner to get hurt. I don't know how that is going to happen, but I know I don't want it. Where Shatter Me was Adam's book, and it made me love him, and it seems like the main character always picks the first love, Unravel Me is Warner's book. We get to see more of that deep, emotional and scarred side of him. And we see more connection with Warner, because Juliette is afraid of hurting Adam. My mind doesn't even know what to think, and that is good writing when I can't make up my mind. As usual, the pacing is great. There is always some sort of action going on, whether battles or character development. Or some scenes that will break your heart, or make you sigh because of the romance. The sequel is hot and I absolutely can't wait for the third. Bottom Line: Awesome sequel, enjoyed Juliette even more in this one!",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

9781405257633,"I had been waiting a long time to get this book. When I read a blog post about the story, I saw that it said that the last book is titled Light. I thought maybe this would mean that the barrier would be gone. But of course, not. I shall not add any spoilers but Fear as the title of this book is very apt. As usual, Michael Grant offered quite a bit of thought-provoking elements with leadership and its responsibilities, being able to do more than what is expected in times of desperate need, humiliation and its effects, loyalty, regret, the gaiaphage (always there), relationships growing and breaking, turning a new leaf, death, and above all of it, fear enveloping the children of The Fallout Alley Zone in a tight embrace.

Astrid is back, but so is Drake and this time he must be faced in the dark. Each installment in this series is better than the last, and Fear is no exception. Alternating between Pete's spirit, those trapped in the FAYZ and those trapped without, this book is by far the most fascinating and the most frightening.

9780545284141,"What a refreshing fantasy book. Yes, it follows the pattern of traditional fantasy but it didn't take itself too seriously. There was a lot of humor and wit. The very best part of this book is the anti-hero, Sage. He had every characteristic that a hero shouldn't have. And somehow they all came in handy. He was very much a young Han Solo that lived in a kingdom instead of a galaxy far, far away. Sage's character contrasted so well with Tobias, who seemed like the kind of character that would have been the hero in most other fantasy books. Sage is the most well-written character I've read in a long time. Just when you can't take any more snark or cheek from him, he shows an incredibly human side. I adored his character. Honestly, I saw the end coming. The plot seemed somewhat predictable which I usually frown upon, but I still enjoyed the story a lot mainly because of Sage and how utterly fascinating he is. I found as the story came to the end, it had a beautiful, bittersweet tone to it that I wasn't expecting. Another thing I found quite intriguing was the theme about our expectations of people based on how we label them. Do we see certain characteristics as virtues or vices because of the label we've given them? I also loved the little ways that it reminded me of Annie, Aladdin and Pirates of the Caribbean like in the opening scene where Sage is running through the streets being chased by guards because he stole some meat. Overall, though it had a slightly predictable plot, it was a sensational and entertaining fantasy book with a stunning main character that you shouldn't miss.",Jessica B

And our story starts when he walks into 'Dolls and More' one fine day to find slightly annoyed, master of sarcasm Caymen behind the counter. A doll shop must be the weirdest place for a love story to originate, so that award definitely goes to Kasie West. Just as Caymen, whose mother owns the shop, dolls creep me out to a certain and slightly unhealthy extent and they weren't exactly helping me to get in a romantic mood. Feigned disinterest and a surprising instant attraction are the foundation for a relationship between two teens from two very different parts of town. Caymen is helping her mother with her shop whenever she can to help paying the bills. She and her mother live in a small apartment above the selling floor. Xander is a rich boy who surely knows about his good looks and the effect of his family's money. Sometimes he appears to be living in a different world with his super expensive clothes and car park. But he isn't as dumb as some might think. He doesn't let himself be controlled by his money and obligations, Xander has a mind of his own. And he is the one who sees Caymen's exceptional personality the second he meets her. He is pretty good boyfriend material. Together they are trying to figure out what to do with their future. Their amusive little meetings to try out various potential jobs bring them closer together. Their love story is one of the expected kinds, rather uneventful and without major surprises. There certainly are problems troubling young Caymen and her relationship with Xander but they are kept low on the overall potential drama scale. Caymen's friendship with her best friend Skye and her boyfriend's band play a role, too. Just like her mother's business. More bigger seeming problems were only insufficiently wrapped in the end and too much time spent in the doll shop. Otherwise THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US is a finely written, distracting holiday read to brighten your beach day with Caymen's dry sarcasm (to which I could relate to very very well). 3,5/ 5 ***/* THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US ??????C/?C/??!?C/?? A breezy and elating, slightly predicatble YA contemporary debut. After reading PIVOT POINT, Kasie West's mind-blowing debut earlier this year, I had high expectations for her first YA contemporary story and felt partly let down. Caymen and Xander are cute as a couple, but wouldn't make my list of most memorable YA couples. I'm still a huge fan of Kasie West, I'm just more enthusiastic about her fantastical and thrilling than her stories solely focusing on the romance.",MissPageTurner

I'm so happy with the fact, there are three books! In a month The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn is in theatres, and I was very nervous. But this book make me totally forget about it. At the moment the only thing I can think about is The Hunger Games movie and books! It my favourite book and I don't think there is another book that can beats it!",Rebecca
9780439023481,"Originally posted on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. When I first got this in the mail about a year or two ago, I quickly set it aside after seeing the not very alluring cover. After days went by I finally decided to try and look past the cover and see what it was about. So I did, and was still not very into wanting it on my reading list. It sounded a bit interesting, but not enough to really draw me in. But now, lately, I've seen this book and it's series around everywhere. I couldn't shake this series. I started reading reviews on it and all of them have been great reviews. I have not seen one bad review so far! Basically all of them are five or four stars. So I finally decided to sit down and try and read it. I told myself that I would read the first 10 pages before I went to bed and if it didn't catch my attention and if I didn't remember what I had read the next day, then I would set it aside again and try and read it at a later time when I was more in the mood for it. The next day came and I remember everything and was more interested in reading it! And I'm so glad that it caught my attention because this is one GREAT book. I can see what all the hype is about it now and why I see ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gail"" around everywhere! Which, by the way, I am completely ""Team Peeta"". Not that there is anything wrong with Gail, he's a nice character. But Peeta has me completely won over! I can see the meaning of the cover now and it fits with the book well. It may not be one of my favorite covers, but I appreciate it a bit more now after reading the book. Collins' world building is prodigious, but scary! I can't imagine being able to live in Panem. The world is already upsetting enough, but not as upsetting as her world would be. Can you imagine being forced to sit down and watch twelve through eighteen year olds fight to the death as entertainment? I couldn't! The characters in this book were real and believable. I couldn't help but want to know more about the other tributes as they were killed off, one by one. Each one had their own personality and it was sad to see them killed. Katniss was the perfect heroine. She was strong, and selfless, and intelligent and her family was her top priority, which is highly admirable. Collins' left nothing out, you read from Katniss point-of-view at all times as though you were really in her mind, watching everything she sees and does. Even though the chapters leaves off in amazing cliff hangers, she starts right back up from where it left off. Which I really liked. Her writing style kept you reading and at the edge of your seat. This review is really hard for me to write because this book completely blew me away and I can't type fast enough to even begin to tell you everything about what is going on in my mind about this book. I highly appreciate the honesty that Collins' put into this book, no matter how disturbing her world was, and I can't wait to continue the series and see what else she has install for us. I recommend this to anyone who would love to be put into a world different, but somewhat the same, as our own. Also, even if the book doesn't sound appealing to you, please try and at least give it a chance and read a chapter of two before you completely dismiss the book. You will be missing out on a wonderful book that I can see as a classic one day.",Amanda
9780439023481,"I only finished reading this book less than 5 minutes ago and was so intrigued to come here and write a review to tell everyone just how awesome this book is. I heard a lot of good stuff about this book, but i was hesitant to pick it up since i wasn't sure if i was going it like this genre. I am more of a paranormal romance kinda gal. But this book proved me wrong, because it was nothing what i had expected. It blew away my expectations and made me soo glad that i went against my judgments and picked up this book. I just wish i had purchased it instead of borrowing from the library, since i plan on reading it over and over again. This story is about North America in the future run by a gov't called ""capitol"". The capitol controls EVERYTHING(similar to communism). So, due to a break out rebellion in the past against the capitol, they have devised the annual Hunger Games to remind everyone who is in control. In The Hunger Games, a boy and a girl from each 12 districts are thrown in a nature-driven(forest, mountains,lake)arena where all the participants must fight to death and finish each other off. The last remaining participant is the winner of the Hunger Games. This story deals with Katniss(main character) and how she rebels against the capitol forcing them to alter their own rules. For the first time in the history of all the hunger games, there is romance IN the hunger games(making the story even better). There was not a dull moment in this book. Very fast paced and made you question your own ways of life. When i wasn't reading it, i was thinking about it ALL THE TIME. Yes! its THAT good. Its science fiction blended with war/gov't and romance. I loved how the author told such a fascinating story about boring topics like government, war, etc,. and intertwined romance in such a way where you had many ""awe"" moments. Sweet Love story!! The characters were well-developed and believable. I am sooo glad its being turned into a movie. I can guarantee its going to be a block buster hit. Good thing i started this trilogy when ALL the books will be released, because the wait would've killed me for sure. SO, when u read The Hunger Games, make sure you got all 3 books in hand if you dont wanna go insane guessing the next part of the story. One story/plot is carried throughout the three books so its best to read all three back to back. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!.....for people of all ages, gender and taste.",JiYa
9780439023481,"When I did learn the meaning of the ""Hunger Games"" I was appalled. Ms. Collins brought the incomprehensible to life. This novel was high on the list at goodreads.com as one book people would like to see made into a movie. I could see why. Yet it didn't take me long to realize I don't want to see this made into a movie. The book was just too touching...heart-wrenching to cheapen it on the screens. I spent a lot of time blinking back tears. I've heard a lot of critters say to lay off the back story. It's a rule Ms. Collins did not follow, and I'm glad for it. Each bit of back story was a treasure, rich in a way which added depth to her characters. I savored every moment. I thought the novel was very age appropriate. It's a novel I'd let my daughters read. Though there was a lot of violence, each choice had real consequences, and decisions were not made lightly. It broke my heart Katniss' world wasn't one of innocence. For the tributes, it was as if every small kindness was the greatest miracle.",Reena Jacobs
9780439023481,"Sometimes when I approach a book for the second time I pause for a moment and wonder, ""What if I don't like it as much this time?"" THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins was no exception - but within the first few pages that feeling was immediately squashed and, once again, I found myself swept away by the story. Knowing what was going to happen in the book did not dull the message much at all for me. I remember being horrified my first time through the story and that horror was still there, but a bit muted. I still cried; when Katniss does the unthinkable for love of family, when Rue cries out for help, when Peeta learns of Katniss' true feelings. I'm not really much of a Team Girl - but I've always learned a little more toward Gale. I like strong characters (and Katniss is a female character I've begun to compare all YA females to). Peeta still comes off as weak to me, helpless. This time I read through the story and found myself wondering what Gale would have done, were he in the same situations. Would he have survived? Suzanne Collins is very talented. She can take a 350+ page book and make it feel like it barely is 100 pages with her ability to create momentum, suspense, a fantastic world that you are able, almost immediately, to grasp. Her descriptions of the food in the Capital had me drooling and I'm not even close to being in the same boat as these teens from District 12. The imagination behind Cinna and the costumes; the strategy of the games - everything is put together so well that, once started, I can't imagine anyone putting this book down. This book goes on the yearly re-read list for me. It's one of those stories that will make your imagination jump around like a 5 year old who has eaten too much sugar.",Lydia Presley
9780439023481,"Meet Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year-old female who lives with her younger sister, Prim, and their mother. Katniss has had an unfortunately difficult life but she has made the best of it. She lives in District 12, the final district of Panem. It is the Coal producing district, and she lost her father, a coal miner, in a mine disaster, years earlier. Panem arose out of what remained of North America after natural and man-made disasters destroyed it. As with many post-apocalyptic tales, rebellions occurred against the powers-that-be, otherwise known as the Capitol. During the uprisings, District 12 was defeated and District 13 was destroyed. In order for the 12 districts to always remember who holds the power, the Capitol began an annual event called The Hunger Games. Every year, each district produces one girl and one boy (ages 12 through 18, randomly drawn) to fight in the Games. The 24 tributes are taken to the Capitol and enjoy a short week of simple training, eating like kings, and attending events and interviews. Then, they are thrown into the vast outdoor arena to fight for their lives, as the Hunger Games has only one winner. As you can probably guess, Katniss is the tribute for District 12, along with Peeta Mellark, the town baker's son. They are whisked away to the Capitol and treated like royalty. It becomes apparent that Katniss may stand a chance in the Games when she proves to the Gamemasters that she possesses great hunting skills. After all, she has been keeping her family from starvation for years by killing game and gathering vegetation (illegally) in the Seam of District 12. While Katniss and Peeta are from the same District, it is no secret that they will eventually face one another as enemies. Peeta is very kind, but Katniss vows not to allow him to weasel his way into her heart. Peeta surprises her though, on many levels and in many ways, throughout the book. Does he eventually weasel his way in? Can he be trusted in such a dire situation? The characters in this novel are very realistic as they sympathize with others and form alliances and friendships even though they face overwhelming odds. All 24 tributes have some sort of page time, some way more than others. The plot is high intensity, very dramatic, deeply emotional and completely engrossing! Katniss is courageous, intelligent, skilled, wily, and compassionate. Peeta is kind, loyal, and brave, but is not on an equal playing field with Katniss' skills. Peeta grew on me. I didn't have much draw towards him through much of the book, but he won me over at the #7 quote below. The mutations of animals that you come across in this world are interesting, freaky and vile! The Capitol bio-engineered certain species for their own purposes - spying, physical damage, etc - and they play serious roles in this story. The mutants at the end of the book completely horrified me and I wonder if we will learn more about them. There are a few twists at certain times in the books. One is very obvious, in my opinion, but the one at the end snuck up on me! It is an ugly twist that will make you gasp, and the outcome of that event sends us flying into the second book, Catching Fire. Conclusion: 5 WHOLE STARS! What an entertaining and simultaneously disturbing novel! While the plot has been done before (The Game, Battle Royale), it does not take away from the emotional intensity you will find yourself feeling page after page! It is nothing short of fantastic. I have yet to speak to a book blogger who did not rave about this trilogy.",Smash Attack

Because I'm not a big reader, but I read the first page as she told me, and I straight away wanted to know what this big 'Secret' was, so I read a couple more pages, and I just got completely hooked, and I couldn't put the book down. It's spoken to you like it was someone talking to you, and the font on the pages is weirdly soothing, that it makes it easier for you to flow through reading it. Rhonda Byrne is a genius, but don't forget she learnt all of this from famous people in the past e.g. ""Albert Einstein, Buddha"" and many more. If you know the secret, you can apply it to anything and everything to make your life the best you could ever ask for.. and more!

Grease, West Side Story, Romeo and Juliet, and just plain old rich fall for the poor. One things for sure, EVERYONE loves the cliche even though they don't admit it. Come on! Some of the best things are cliche, hello... Vampires. Everyone should stop complaining about it being ""cliche"" and just admit that it was a FABULOUS cliche. This book was beyond wonderful, it kept me up all night, and to tell you the truth, not many books have done that. This is my first read from Simone Elkeles and I was simply blown away. Her reputation of producing amazing contemporary romances is by far true! Everything about this book seemed so real and true. Elkeles really went out there and researched about gangs, heir scenarios and how things work with them. She really kept this book by the book if you know what I mean. Brittany and Alex are complex characters with major family problems. They're both striving to keep up an image. Brittany with her perfect life and Alex with his bad-boy-gang-not-so-perfect-life. They were both so real, and a reader can't help but feel like they really know them. To sum it all up, Perfect Chemistry is that GOOD and is by far one of the best YA Romances I've read and the best way to start the new year! A guaranteed unputdownable book from Simone Elkeles.",Najla Qamber
9781847388056,"Falling in love has never been so beautiful...Simone Elkeles has created a romantic love story between two teenagers who are so different, yet so similar in Perfect Chemistry. Brittany Ellis has it all - she's beautiful, rich, and has a gorgeous boyfriend. But appearances can be deceiving. Underneath her glorious, perfect facade, she is burdened by the strict demands of her mother and she has to prevent her parents from sending her disabled sister, Shelley away. Alejandro (Alex) Fuentes is a gangster from the Latino Blood. His sole aim of joining the gang is to protect his family. But deep down, he wants to get out from the gang and be successful in life. Two people who are at opposite sides of the world are brought together in a Chemistry class. At first, there is only hatred for each other. But as they start to understand each other deeper, a mutual bond forms between them. Will Alex follow the steps of his late father on a journey with no return? Is Brittany willing to reveal her deepest secrets to Alex? Will they be together at last? You'll have to read this book to find out! I love this book! It's so good that I can't stop reading it! In my opinion, the relationship between Alex and Brittany is very well-written. It's very plausible, and the teenage angst instilled is in a suitable amount. Each chapter is told from alternating point of views - Alex's and Brittany's. This enables readers to judge the characters' situations based on both their perspectives and get a more exact idea of their different ways of thinking and lifestyles. Both narrators are quite good, but sometimes it's hard for me to understand what Alex is speaking because I don't understand Spanish. Although this book is mainly about the romance between Alex and Brittany, it actually tells us that we cannot judge a book by its cover, nor a person by his or her appearance. It also reflects the various social issues that exist in our society, such as drug abuse and gangsterism. One good thing I noticed about this book is that Simone never try to impress readers with flowery writing. She uses her words as a medium to express her ideas in a clever and honest way --- and look, she has done it so brilliantly in Perfect Chemistry! The epilogue of this story will leave readers smiling in delight. I never expected that to happen! As a conclusion, I'm in love with this book and the characters. I'd definitely give it 5 stars! The mere thought of Rules of Attraction (Perfect Chemistry #2) fills me with excitement and anticipation!",Aik
9780385740074,"Every country and every people that resides have different culture and have different story to tell. From the most depressing experience of their lives from most unforgettable moments they felt in their childhood. But how can they manage to express and treasure those experiences forever? Some people write them on their journals or diaries, some record it through tapes and CDs, some tell their past lives from their grandsons and few write and compile their stories into a book. Adeline Yen Mah's short biography, exploring her childhood experiences, meant to be read and inspired other readers. She wrote this book for teens and young kids to express her desire and sadness in the past while living with her stepmother, living without desire, loosing hopes and dreams and losing her rights as a child of his father. She was born rich and born bad luck because of her mother's death, nobody desires to enter her life even her siblings except her aunt. Adeline struggles to grow when the days past. They are awfully sad and very painful for the readers. She was not welcome to the household as she carries bad luck, she find friends and a place where she belong, a place where only happiness can be found, the school. Her lives possessed with desires to achieve the top just to be recognized by her father. Her father, who only believed to fiction stories that her 2nd wife told, not believing that he already forgotten her first wife's children. As Adeline struggle to the top and gaining freedom in the end, she manages to show her success by education and share her success through books. She graduated in London Hospital Medical School in Europe with the help of a miracle, a winning piece that change her life forever. After a very long journey she practiced her course in California and become a teacher and author, and helping children in China to go to school and to make their wishes come true. This thin book is very emotionally uncontrollable; she wrote most of her depressing stories from the first chapter until the end and few not-quite-happy memories. This biography is not suitable for those people who have heart and eye problems; I suggest that you have to skip reading this book not to mention that this had a serious problem to childhood experiences. I live with a group of Chinese kids when I was young and agree that Chinese parents, teachers and other professionals are very strict with their children that I can't believe that Adeline have this gap and heart breaking experience with her parents. Although this is normal for a child, but this change my perspective towards other traditions and beliefs of Chinese people. This book is not as good as any biography book I read, but this book is very inspiring and consider that she implement education as a tool to succeed in life and trying to emphasize that expectation is not only give negative results but also positive. One thing that I observe from the book is that, she needed more attention to her parents and siblings. I'm not a psychologist but I think a child must grow needed high attention of the parents. At least, she succeeds in the end. I recommend this to all half Chinese kids, teens and adults who have the same experience with Adeline or readers that are curious to Chinese tradition. This black book is full of sad memories, so fragile that every reader wanted to keep it forever even the sadness keep on pouring inside the book. Adeline, you are a true beauty of success and you make Cinderella go gaga. @OldFahionedReader.blogspot.com http://tinyurl.com/3k9dqhl",Kwesi Ian Jay M. Junsan
9780763662622,"I'll be honest, the first time I tried to read this book, I put it down after a few pages. The language and ""feed"" in the chapters made me feel a little nauseous. But a week or so later I decided to go ahead and give the book another shot. I'm glad I did. I'm not too sure if I would label this as a dystopian. Futuristic, yes. The story follows Titus and his friends who go on vacation to the moon. While there, Titus comes acoross Violet, a strangely different girl in a material world. They are all hacked at a party, and their feeds, think a constant internet connection in your head, go down. Titus continues his relationship with Violet after their recovery and return to earth only to find out that she is seriously different. Ths is a very strange novel, and will leave readings quesitoning what it means to be connected. While I thought that the premise of this book was very interesting, I was a little disappointed by the ending. The book did not provide me with quite the transformation that I wanted to see, specifically in the character Titus. Yet, I feel that the novel says something important and in some ways acts as a frightening omen of what the future could be if we don't listen. 3.5 out of 5 stars!",Beth
9780141328553,"And I thought I'd had enough of vampires. After many beloved and some stereotypical YA vampire books in the past years I felt fine with putting that category on the waiting list for a while. Until I decided to pick up the first book in this series and Richelle Mead's VAMPIRE ACADEMY restored my faith in good and imaginative vampire worlds. I'd had my eyes on the VAMPIRE ACADEMY books for quite a while, many people kept recommending them and I can remember the rave about the last book in the series. Now with the first movie coming out in 2014 I couldn't hold out on this series any longer. Richelle's series isn't your average -There's a vampire in this story and he's gonna bite you, so you become one, too- story. In the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series you don't encounter ordinary vampires. There are different types of blood-suckers, like different links to an evolutionary chain. Our two heroines Rose and Lissa cover the two categories of Moroi and Dhampirs. Moroi are vampires who have the power to wield magic. Dhampirs are a crossing between Moroi and humans and their task is to protect royal Moroi. At the St. Vladimir's Academy they are receiving a special training for the purpose of becoming body guards when they are finished. Those two kinds are co-existing and depending on the other, never purposefully harming humans. The Strigoi make up the third and an entirely different category. They are soulless creatures only existing to destory and hurt humans, Moroi and Dhampirs alike. Strigoi are effortless killers, but they can also be cruel enough to turn the other vampires into one of them and doom them to become evil and heartless, too. They make for evil and seemingly unstoppable enemies in all six books of this series. The fight between Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi is the main focus of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series. Of course you can expect political, social and personal conflicts as well. Now the St. Vladimir's Academy is home to many Moroi and Dhampirs and is the central setting for the six books in this series. Housing, training and study rooms assembled like a small campus, the academic feel is definitely there. But with all the unexpected attacks and complications appearing on the scene it's no wonder Rose and her friends are forced to leave their textbooks behind and step into battle. The characters are travelling a lot, too. Really enjoyed seeing many new places together with Rose and her friends. All six books read on a book binge equal a huge vamptastic adventure beyond imagination. So much action and fights! However the series has its quiet moments, too. The greatest personal focus lies on the bond Rose and Lissa share as best friends and their spiritual bond that's pretty special for Moroi standards. Rose can feel what Lissa's feeling and in certain moments even see through Lissa's eyes. At first this was a very fun aspect about their friendship. The more often Rose visited Lissa's body though, story lows occurred. Sometimes I just felt like skipping these scenes altogether. Rose is the breakaway, tough and sexy warrior. Lissa her well-guarded, spiritual, emphatic prot???Â©ï¸g???Â©ï¸. They are body and mind, friends who rule the hearts of many readers. They are lucky to have been gifted with two equally appealling love stories, slightly erotic, romantic and steamy for sure. Lissa finds Christian, an outsider, who was not even looking for acceptance until he met Lissa. They are healing each other from the wounds of their pasts and click together like a puzzle meant to exist. And Rose gets her love story with Dimitri. Just like everyone told me, that guy is sexy! Their difference in age and experience puts a forbidden touch to their love story. He is her instructor and she is supposed to keep her hands off him. Is that a dare? Major turn-on! SHADOW KISS is the part of Rose's story that concentrates on the St. Vlad's students' training the most. The academy announces a big training and fight simulation for the entire school, which is supposed to prepare them for their lives as body guards. In the beginning of each book Rose is often telling you what's happened so far. What is a thoughtful help for people who had to wait such a long time between the novels, is kind of repetitive for binge readers like me. Tiring were recaps in the beginning, retellings of major events in past books and hints as explanations to relationships strewn into the ongoing story. The books keep getting longer and longer. Currently LAST SACRIFICE is the longest book I've read so far this year. Not just in page count ?C/a?!a?? 2688 pages- is this series truly epic, but in its emotional variety, youthful voices, and imaginative, adventurous story line. 5/5 ***** VAMPIRE ACADEMY Series- One of the most enthralling and memorable YA vampire worlds I've had the pleasure to live in. A series I wish I would have encountered much sooner. I'm so glad that all six books were released already and I could pick up the next book right after one was finished. I wouldn't have wanted to wait one year for each of them to come out. The first three BLOODLINES books are waiting on my Kindle to be read. The decision whether to start the series now or wait till all of them have been released has yet to be made.",MissPageTurner
9780552566001,"Seraphina is high fantasy Younng Adult novel, but not in the watered down way some young adult novels like to pretend they are high fantasy. This novel truly is. It has it's own religion, cultures, languages, races, places and more. The effort that Rachel Hartman put into crafting her world perfectly leaves you to realise your breathless. The novel is set in the land of Goredd where the crown Prince has been murdered by what appears to be a Dragon. Tensions are high because the anniversary of the treaty where humans and Dragons declared peace is drawing near, but if Dragons really did kill the prince it could mark and end to the peace that already seems to be balancing on the edge of a knife. Seraphina, our heroine and wilful musician, is drawn into the investigation due to her deep knowledge of Dragons, but the deeper she goes the more danger she gets into as things about her and her family are slowly revealed. Many people have said this book starts of slow, which it might do, but from the start I was so fascinated by the world and the characters that the pace of the book felt necessary to me and by the end I wished it would drag on more. Not a moment of the relationships or discoveries in this novel felt rushed. Everything had a very natural pace at which things were revealed so that you never saw them coming but they made sense all the same. I loved how Hartman developed her characters. None of them felt like stock YA characters that just filled the gap. Seraphina was strong willed and intelligent, always searching for answers. Her passion for her music was endearing and beautiful but at the same time she was a very flawed character. Her self-loathing was not something I often come across in YA or fantasy novels. Teenage girls are stereotypically a bit insecure in YA but Seraphina had a level of loathing I connected to because I had also been like that at her age due to the opinions of others (but for different reasons obviously) and for that it made me feel incredibly protective of her as a character. Another thing I didn't find with this book that I find with other YA is that she didn't lose her voice in my head. Sometimes YA authors make their first person characters so nondescript and lacking in personality that I feel like it's my own voice narrating, but then that makes the entire story arch of the character and their struggles pointless because they aren't my struggles and so I don't feel any sympathy or empathy for the character like I did with Seraphina. The characters around her were also more than just people for her to interact with. The love interest was kind, caring and bound to his honor in a way that sometimes made his interactions with Seraphina infuriating but understandable. He had issues in his past but not ones that turned him into a moper every chance he got to talk about them (this is what I call Edward Cullen syndrome). He also had his fun moments and even though I didn't fall for him as a character I could see the slow, bittersweetness of him and Seraphina falling in love and it broke my heart constantly. Orma was strong even though he constantly questioned his own sanity due to his actions going against his nature. Glisselda could have easily been bratty or mean but she was lovely, if a bit naive from time to time, as well as beautiful and had some real character development through out. I'm really interested in seeing the woman she will become over the next books. The writing was beautifully descriptive without ever sounding to wordy or ridiculous. It sounded wonderful in my head while still sounding like Seraphina's voice which was also perfect for her character because the words almost had a lyrical quality that fit so well with her musical gift. The best thing in this book for me was that I never guessed the outcome of anything. Unlike books like Cinder, where there's something that's a little info-dumpy so it sticks out and becomes an obvious plot point, things in Seraphina relieved themselves when they were ready to because Hartman didn't decide you needed to know some stuff and then tell you too much, she just decided to reveal things when the characters found them out or when they naturally would be talked about. This meant the whole book had a very mysterious feel to it and kept me enthralled through out.",Iona
9780552566001,"Hellow, What dragged me to this? Well dragons, should I say more? There is a couple of subjects that make books a must read for me, and dragons is one of them, if not the most important one. And you have to agree, this cover is just gorgeous for a medieval setting book. So perfect *.* The first thing that impressed me was the writing, it is almost lyrical although very dense, but not in a boring way, it is that rich kind of dense that is quite descriptive but leaves you with something to be guessed, it has mystery about it, it's almost languid, in a way that it involves you in this world and leaves you wanting to know more. Goredd is a great fantasy world ,imagine a great historical book set on the medieval times with a twist of fantasy on it, being this, dragons, of course it could not go wrong, at least for me. Specially when this dragons are different from anything you ever read, you get to know their culture, the political intrigues, not only between them, but with humans too, and most important , at least for me, was getting to know the struggle that it is for them to understand the human culture and deal with feeling while searching for knowledge. The conversations between the characters address subjects like philosophy, art, religion and so on in a very well put together way, that makes me want to have tea with them and chat for hours on real life. That being said I think this is one of the most important features about this book, it seems realistic enough to keep me engaged, it is something I would like to experience, it's like I am reading about the past, although I know the real deal was not so amazing. Seraphina must be my favourite female character in a while, she is everything I admire in a heroine with a great touch of reality, she can be cranky(like a lot) ,she makes mistakes , she is very stubborn and gets played by other characters and still she suffers without being annoying(this is a big point, most YA heroines are winy creatures), that mostly comes from knowing sacrifice and loneliness ,but gratitude and will power too. Half-dragons were a surprise and a good one, although I am still hoping Seraphina would evolve or change at will to a mini dragon I really liked all the different evolutions that resulted of the humans+dragons relationships. Even this damn triangle is amazing, and believe me, love triangles are one of my greatest pet peeves. But I just can't hate Princess Glisselda, she's such a strong character and evolves in such a great way with the plot that I just can't decide if she or Seraphina should find another love interest throughout the story. Kiggs on the other way was not of my liking, unfortunately he seems to be a lot weaker that Seraphina and she seems to lead the romance, and I would prefer him to be the one leading her on the webs of passion. Seraphina itself being half dragon has some issues with feelings, that was interesting, special when you see her falling in love, although I would like to see a bit more of internal struggle with it, she seems to give herself too soon. I can't even hate the villains, truth must be said, most of this characters have their share of good and evil, and they have they're own reasons to believe something is right or wrong, and that is a great way of seeing that they are all very well written. I have to say that this must be my favourite YA I read this year. With that said I must point out that although I read a lot of YA books, I have a hard time loving one as much as I love this one. What I seek mostly in the YA genre is a plot that does not focus mostly on sex on intervals of every 10 pages or less, but ,most of the times I get disappointed with the younger books because they lack emotion or adventure, and the romance mostly feels like teenage obsession rather than real love, and believe me , I understand that most of people don't have the luck of finding they're soul mate at all , much less when they are less then 25 years old, but plots can be very focused on this and most of the times the author looses the true essence of the story while getting carried away on the couple part. Seraphine had this ""amazingness"" factor about it, and that, lays mostly on the fact that the romance plays a part of the book, but that is it, the book itself it's a lot more about the self growth of the main character as a woman and a political weft on this celebration rather than the love part. This will be something I will re-read a lot on the future, no doubt. Dear Hartman, thank you a lot, I will be an avid reader on the near future.

9780316013697,"I'll admit -- I put off reading THE ABSOLUTELY TRUE DIARY OF A PART-TIME INDIAN for well over a year, in favor of more ""exciting"" books. Boy, what a mistake I made! Told from the perspective of thirteen-year-old Arnold Spirit, an intelligent, observant, sarcastic Indian born with encephalitis and a love of cartooning, Sherman Alexie takes us along with him as he moves away from a circumscribed, oppressive life on the Spokane reservation towards a more promising future by attending an all-white school thirty miles away. Never one to get bogged down in sentiment or self-pity, Mr. Alexie refuses to present Arnold's friends and family as one-dimensional stereotypes, nor is the world beyond ""rez"" borders portrayed as the Great White Hope. Arnold's family has problems, to be sure: an alcoholic father, an enabling, codependent mother; a near shut-in older sister. But their love for each other is evident through their words and actions. And despite the ostracism and ridicule heaped upon him by former friends and other tribe members, Arnold reacts with biting wit rather than total despair. This has to be one of the best books I've ever read in my life, so I hope everyone gives it a try. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780375803017,"Opening this book is like opening a present. Originally published in 1972, publisher Alfred A. Knopf has printed a new hardcover edition. The dust-jacket is beautifully illustrated, the book is of an unusual size. Everything about it says ""special."" Inside, I was not disappointed. Bradbury swept me away with his opening scene: ""It was a small town by a small river and a small lake in a small northern part of a Midwest state. There wasn't so much wilderness around you couldn't see the town. But on the other hand there wasn't so much town you couldn't see and feel and touch and smell the wilderness. The town was full of trees. And dry grass and dead flowers now that autumn was here. And full of fences to walk on and sidewalks to skate on and a large ravine to tumble in and yell across. And the town was full of... Boys. And it was the afternoon of Halloween. And all the houses shut against a cool wind. And the town was full of cold sunlight. But suddenly, the day was gone. Night came out from under each tree and spread."" This scene sets the tone for the entire book. THE HALLOWEEN TREE is as classic a Halloween story as A CHRISTMAS CAROL is for Christmas. It is about a group of boys, all friends, ages 11-12, who dress up for their annual night of Halloween mischief and go trick or treating. The boys find themselves at a particularly spooky mansion in a dark ravine, with a Marley-the-ghost door knocker and a gigantic tree covered with jack-o-lanterns. As the jack-o-lanterns light up one by one, the boys realize they are in the presence of a Halloween Tree, and that something very special is about to happen. The resident of the house, the mysterious Mr. Moundshroud, takes the boys on a fantastic journey through traditions of Halloween past. This story is part history lesson, but the history is provided in such a compelling way that your average reader won't even realize he or she is learning something. Perhaps the only downside to this story is that it is so dominantly geared toward a male audience. All of the major characters are male. Though, being female myself, I could get lost in the spookiness of the narrative. Bradbury uses his trademark short sentences which are short on exposition but long on crafting a mood. The story is spooky without ever being scary, and is sure to delight kids of all ages.",TeensReadToo
9780525423287,"Dolores Nolan (better known as Lola) is a seventeen year old budding fashion designer. Vowing to never wear the same outfit twice in a calendar year, her clothes are often somewhat eccentric but always an original. Her two dads hate her twenty-two year old on the verge of becoming a rockstar boyfriend, Max. Her birth mother is a fortune telling mess and the Bell twins, Cricket and Calliope, with whom Lola has a feud have just moved back in next door. Senior year is shaping up nicely... and it hasn't even started yet. Trying to navigate through family issues and wardrobe dilemmas, Lola is just trying to make it though. But Cricket keeps popping up all over the place. In the street, in stores Lola's frequenting - Cricket even turns up at the cinema where Lola works! After what happened two summers before, Lola doesn't know if she can trust him. But feelings become involved and Lola becomes conflicted. Should she choose the hot glamorous older rocker Max or Cricket - the boy next door. I loved Anna and the French Kiss and the main reason I picked up a copy of Lola was because I'd heard there was a guest appearance of Anna and St. Clair. I'm glad I decided to read Lola's story because it's just as adorable and sweet as Anna's French Kiss. Lola is fun. She's quirky and adventurous It's not just her fashion sense that's colourful. Her family life was such a delightful contrast to that of Anna's - her dads set curfews, rules regarding boyfriends and keep an eye on just who is coming and going from their daughter's bedroom. Her mother is an interesting character who had a very interesting relationship with Lola. I loved how they all interacted with each other - it felt authentic. Lola's own personal conflict was more than just her love life. She becomes confused to whether it's the girl who makes the costumes or the costumes who make the girl. And then there's the boys in Lola's life. Max - whom everyone from her best friend Lindsay to her parents and even her colleagues at the cinema thinks is too old for her. I loved the contrast that he provided for Cricket. Oh Cricket. I have so many adjectives I could use to describe this character (who I absolutely adored) but I think the one that fits best is awkward. He's delightfully awkward. In that way that makes him go from a nerd to geek chic in my eyes. I'm a sucker for romantic gestures and Cricket's conversations and general adorableness was the kind that made my heart feel like it had grown five sizes from reading it. He's just that dorky romantic soul that I love reading about. Anna and St. Clair make a few appearances in this book and whilst it was great to see them again (and that was the main reason why I decided to read this book) there was something about their scenes that felt a little odd to me. It's interesting to see a relationship that blossomed from their point of view to all of a sudden being on the outside looking in. They have certainly matured - both as people and with regards to their relationship. I have to admit that I didn't enjoy reading about their romance as much as I did in their own book but I thought it was a lovely way to tie their story to Lola's. This book was a joy to read. I loved the romance and the characters. The leads were sweet and fun and the supporting characters kept things interesting and the plot moving along. Isla and the Happily Ever After comes out in September and I know for sure that I'll be purchasing a copy.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780525423287,"Sequins, glitter and colours - that's Dolores' world! And because that name doesn't really keep up with her shiny personality, let's call that girl Lola. I was cautious at first, not convinced that I would love this new protagonist Lola as much as good old Anna. She is that colourful and crazy and really talented, really creative girl. I can totally identify with creative, still I was afraid that she would be too sparkly. Once I started reading I gave up my resistance fast. Despite her sparkly appearance, she's got a very decent and down-to-earth, reliable personality. Stephanie Perkins presents unique characters, who fill out the entire story. Cricket is a complex character himself and although I knew how he felt about certain things it was still so much fun to figure him out every time anew. I loved him, and I wouldn't mind him playing with my mechanisms -does that sound too dirty? He's smart, a nerd, an inventor and has style. Swoon! Cricket is such a fantastic protagonist and it was a nice change to actually know about his feelings. He isn't the bad boy or in-transparent mystery, he's simply the nice guy living next door. Exactly that makes him so adorable. We've got several issues like drugs, sex and also the gay couple who are Lola's parents. I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to such topics, I encourage their thematisation, when dealt within a respectable and serious way. Lola's two dads are too funny and I appreciated the way Stephanie Perkins pictured their relationship being very serious, at the same time involving light jokes. I was very amused and delighted by the two Dads! The story is mostly about Lola and her discovering her feelings and what she'll make out of her talent. I hoped there to be more accentuation on Calliope and Lola's relationship since she's Cricket's twin sister. But I do like that there is so much interaction between Lola and Cricket. And I was so happy to meet Etienne and Anna again, although funny as it sounds I first didn't get that it was the talk of the French kiss Anna when Lola talked about her co-worker Anna. It's awesome to get the chance to read more about them, their lives and their super cute love. I can't wait to meet them all again in ISLA AND THE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. THE VERDICT LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR- Sparkling, shiny and beautiful! LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR is like that new outfit you'll never want to take off again. This book just fits perfectly and is so comfortable. There are so many contrasts in LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR and it's delightful to have such a crazy and outgoing, extravagant heroine. Lola rocks!",MissPageTurner
9780525423287,"I've been dying to read this since I finished Anna and the French Kiss back in August 2011. I won this in a Twitter giveaway from Andra and it took a while to get here because of the stupid mail people, and I was SO excited to have it in my possession. But once I finally had it, I couldn't read it! I wanted to SO badly, but I wanted to save it for a time that I got into a major reading slump. Which, I did! And I joined a read-a-thon and read it during that time and it definitely got me out of my slump, though now after I've read it nothing else compares and it really sucks! It took me a couple of pages to really get into this new character. You can obviously tell Stephanie Perkins wrote this book, she has a certain unique voice to her that makes you fly through the pages of her books before realizing you're already a hundred pages in. But this wasn't Anna, and I was worried she wouldn't be able to compare to her. Which, she doesn't. I do like Anna better. But I absolutely LOVE Lola. She's definitely unique! I'd definitely want to be her friend. It was hilarious when Anna and St. Clair pop up in this book. At first when I saw the name Anna and the whole thing with Anna's banana necklace, it didn't click for some reason. I was too into the story to notice. But when I read St. Clair's name, oh boy. I freaked out and had to go back a page or so to read where Anna showed up again. And then I was all, ""Yay! Anna and St. Clair."" and gosh, they are SO freaking cute. And hilarious. Just makes me so jealous! I love my husband to death, but sometimes I'd love to go back to fresh new love where we wanted to be EVERYWHERE the other way. Sooo cute! But anyway, the characters are so real in this book. For a while Lola was annoying me a bit, I was screaming at her asking her what the hell was up with her with Max. Yes, he's a hot rockstar. BUT he wasn't right for her. I'm not going to go into anymore details about that.... But, oh, Cricket. He's so awkward and cute and makes you want to just snuggle up to him and give him a HUGEEE hug. *le sigh* I'm SO happy with the ending! Overall, yes, I do love Anna and the French Kiss more. But this definitely was an amazing read and definitely one of my favorite contemporarys. I can't wait for the next companion novel. I'm going to be sad about getting into yet another characters head, but I know it will be great. =D Don't stop writing, Stephanie! You're amazing! I recommend this cute companion novels to EVERYONE!

If you haven't read her first book, Anna and the French Kiss, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE you to read it first before Lola (though not really required). You'll not regret reading it. Besides, Anna and Etienne from the first book appears here too, so you won't want to miss it! This is a girl loves boy since childhood but guys moved away so she got a boyfriend. But then boy is back and she's caught in between so who to choose? Boyfriend or childhood boy? This is the story of Lola and the Boy Next Door. You think this is a normal story? You are so wrong! Lola is talented and has a colorful sense of dressing and what could be more interesting than having 2 fathers? Wow. Characters are really good. Besides Lola and Cricket (the childhood boy), there's Max (her boyfriend), Lindsey (her best friend), Calliope (Cricket's twin) and more. Each is unique and realistic.

9780525423287,"After reading Anna and the French Kiss I was seriously ecstatic for this book. I wanted Stephanie Perkins' story to give me the butterflies and the smiles from ear to ear, and the laugh out loud moments that she gave me with Anna. Lola's book didn't quite affect me the way that Anna's book did, but it was still pretty good! I think when you get right down to it, the thing that didn't strike home for me was Lola. While she's very sweet and I liked her, I couldn't relate to her like I could with Anna. Me and Anna had quite a lot in common, especially personality-wise. I could totally see hanging out and getting along swimmingly with Anna. But Lola is seriously the opposite of me (and Anna) in almost every way. So even though I liked her, I didn't really understand her. She's very outgoing, outspoken, and has a huge personality. I am totally none of those things! lol So, I think for me this brought the whole story down. I need to relate to the main character, and I just couldn't with Lola. Then we have Cricket. I really liked Cricket, but I didn't feel as strongly about him as I did with St. Clair. If we're talking opposites, he's pretty much the opposite of St. Clair as well. Not that him being tall and shy is a bad thing. It's sweet and endearing. But, I just wasn't getting butterflies for Lola and Cricket. Their chemistry wasn't intense enough (especially in the beginning of the book). Now once Lola and Cricket got to talking a bit more later on in the book, their story and chemistry got a bit more interesting. I enjoyed watching them fall for each other all over again. I also really enjoyed Lola's family overall. Even Norah. They all just seemed very genuine and like good people and I liked them a lot. So yeah. I know a lot of people have said they liked this book even better than Anna and the French Kiss, but I am not one of those people. While it was still a sweet book and I still very much enjoy Stephanie Perkins' writing, this one just didn't do it for me as much. I can't even believe I didn't even save a single quote from the book! With Anna I wrote down so many witty comments and conversations that I absolutely adored. Now that I mention it, I think that's another thing that was missing. This book didn't have as much humor, sarcasm, and witty dialog. I missed that. I also did not like how much Lola felt like she had to lie about lots of things. She sort of seemed like a chronic liar at some points. But anyways, overall I actually did like the book. It was very sweet and romantic, and the awkward yet exciting moments between Cricket and Lola were fun to read. I definitely still can't wait to read Isla and the Happily Ever After, but I don't think I'll be expecting another Anna going into it like I did with this one.",I'm Loving Books
9780525423287,"Original post here: http://unputdownablebookies.blogspot.com/2011/11/review-lola-and-boy-next-door-by.html Stephanie Perkins has written another masterpiece that combines, teenage drama, love and realism all in one book. Lola and the Boy Next Door is a beautiful book about Lola and her resurfaced feelings for the Bell twins who moved back into the neighborhood. From start to finish, Perkins holds you in her wordly grasp as she writes about Lola's struggle to overcome the obstacles she's facing to be honest with herself. Lola is a colorful character with two gay dads and a love for fashion. That's a little of an understatement. She doesn't love fashion, she loves costume. Which she creates herself. She has a wonderful personality and friends. I'm happy Perkins mentioned the characters from her last book (Anna and St. Clair) and carefully writes them to surround Lola. They don't play a big part in the story but they're there for moral support and a little push here and there for both Lola and Cricket. Cricket Bell, is the Boy the Next Door. Incredibly sweet and awfully nice. He's always been around Lola and there has always been unspoken tension around the both of them, that takes half of the book for them to both be honest and real to each other. I didn't mind the wait since Perkins kept me fully occupied with other events in Lola's life. To sum it all up, Lola and the Boy Next Door was an amazing read that will tickle your toes, make your eyes go blurry and totally make you go ""awwwwwwwh!""

That is Emily Starr talking, the young blossoming writer, that will touch your heart, with her creative and interesting, ways and ideas. Within just the first chapter of the book, you'll already be intrigued by Emily's charm, and her topsy-turvy imagination. All through the story, Emily meets new people and friends. Some will help her on her way to becoming a writer, ""a painter that uses words"". Others will shoot her dreams down, as if they were nothing but mere dust. Just watch her take on all the distressing incidents that she overcomes with an intellect beyond her years. She's always on a new enchanting romp, that'll keep you guessing. From giving up her beloved cat, to clashing with Miss Brownell (her unjust schoolteacher), to unraveling an age-old puzzle with her whimsical mind, you'll stay right by Emily's side the whole time. Here's a small excerpt that I especially enjoyed: ""But there is a destiny which shapes the ends of young misses who are born with the itch for writing tingling in their baby fingertips, and in the fullness of time this destiny gave to Emily the desire of her heart---gave it to her, too, on the very day when she most needed it."" Personally, I have to state that this book is very inspirational for anyone endeavoring a priceless dream.

9780553233704,"Emily of New Moon is one of the few books I really highly praise and recommend to my friends. While L.M. Montgomery might be better known for the Anne of Green Gables series, the Emily trilogy is often claimed to be the favorite of many Montgomery fans. And that is for a reason, Emily is by no means a rip off from Anne. She may share the fate of being an orphan and also moving in with a old stubborn old fashioned woman for an aunt, but Emily's personality and way of communication is very different from Anne Shirley. Also, Emily is the type of girl who has a few but life-long close friends. All in all, the setup may sound the same, but Emily is very different than Anne Shirley for sure. Also the writing in this book is superb, it really shows that it was written further into Montgomery's career. Of course, this series also has a lot of humor in it like Montgomery always shows in her books. The nature descriptions are wonderful as well. I'll refrain from discussing this book any further to avoid spoilers. Since it's simply a lovely book which is read best by just reading without knowing what to expect.",Lysanne Reijmers

Maybe it was because I am partial to the sci-fi/fantasy genre, but truthfully I don't think that had anything to do with it. This story was just.... WOW! Imagine sitting in class one day, maybe you are paying attention to your teacher, maybe you are daydreaming about surfing, then all of a sudden your teacher disappears. What would you do? It just so happens that this very scenario happens to Sam Temple in his history class. It turns out his teacher isn't the only one missing; everyone over the age of thirteen is missing. Not just missing but disappeared. No cell phones, no television, no Internet. Poof, gone! Sam has been in a horrific experience like this before. Well, maybe not exactly like this. Sam had saved a bunch of kids on a school bus after the driver had a heart attack, good ole' School Bus Sam. Sam was a natural leader, but he didn't feel like it. Now everyone is looking up to him for answers, but all Sam feels is guilt. Guilt because there is a possibility that this was his fault. Sam has this little problem -- he can shoot beams of light and burn people's hands off. Literally. But I guess things like that happen when you live in Fallout Alley. Thankfully, Sam isn't alone. He has his best friend and surfer brah, Quinn; the genius, Astrid, who Sam has secret feelings for; and the faithful and dependable Edilio. Of course, in any untamed civilization, there is always a power struggle, those who have it and those who want to take it away. It turns out that Sam isn't the only one who has ""powers."" When the kids from the private school, Coates Academy, show up, Sam and Astrid realize there is something more going on. It also doesn't help that the kids from Coates and the kids from Perdido don't exactly get along. Caine from Coates Academy comes in, dazzles everyone with his charm, and takes control of the FAYZ, a.k.a. Fallout Alley Youth Zone. Caine has his own secrets. He has powers of his own. And if he thinks your powers might be a threat to him, he takes care of you one way or another. But when Caine's sinister sidekick, Drake, allows a girl to be beaten to death with a baseball bat for doing a ""magic trick,"" things go from bad to worse. Caine knows that everyone looks up to Sam as a leader; so begins the battle of good vs. evil. Besides, Caine has his own hidden agenda toward Sam. Oh! And did I mention that when you turn fourteen, you poof, too? So not only does Sam have to save this new world, but he will also be fourteen in a week or so. No worries, though. Yeah, right! There are so many twists and turns in the plot of GONE that you won't be able to put this book down until it's, well, gone. But don't fret, this is only the beginning of a six-part series. The characters are well-developed. I love when you feel like you really connect with characters, and this was one of those experiences. You not only get to experience Sam's part of the story but the views of many other characters. There is action, suspense, romance, science fiction, and fantasy all rolled into one.

I loved Gayle Forman's 'If I Stay' duology so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book! And I was not disappointed, I loved this book and give it a 4/5 stars! Let me start by saying this book gave me so much wanderlust! I want to go to Paris and travel the rest of Europe and just be a wanderer, and just be free. It made me want to learn French and date a Dutch man. This book made me want the world! Onto the plot, I liked that it took place over the course of year, it kept the plot on a steady pace. The first section of the book was my favourite because it was just like a dream, a somewhat realistic dream and I just fell in love with it. The next section was a slap back into reality and I appreciated that because the book would have bordered on cheesy if the dream affect lasted the entire novel! The final section was a mixture of both which was a great conclusion to the novel! Can I just say this book leaves on a massive cliffhanger! On of the worst ones I've ever read! There are numerous different topics and themes addressed in the novel from finding your true self, to overbearing parents, to first love and so on and I feel they were done really well! As for the characters, well this is were I took a star off! The main character is Allyson and in the middle section of the book she really irritated me because she was too depressing and sombre and I just wanted to hit her! However in the beginning and end sections of the book I just loved her, she developed into a strong, open minded young lady and I was rooting for her! Then there is Williem who we only see a little of but I liked most what I saw, but there was just something about him I didn't like, I don't know what but it makes it hard for me to think of him as a good love interest! As for the other characters, Allyon's mum was so annoying and pushy, I couldn't stand her and Allysons 'best friend' was also not that great but I did love Dee and the other travellers Allyson meet! Overall this book was great and I cannot wait to the sequel!",brookexx

9780385739139,"At the very start of the story we get a peek of a couple, where one is trying to stay away from the other and the other is trying just as hard to be with that one... but I'll come back to the first chapter in a bit. Luce Price has arrives at Sword & Cross, a reform school for troublesome teens, and instantly knows that this school isn't like any other school, reform or not, this is a school that she could never have imagined existing. Such a dark, unwelcoming and prison-like place, where contact with the outside world is only allowed in 5 minute weekly phone calls, their uniform is to wear all black and there are security cameras everywhere to monitor your every move. Everything seems hopeless and depressing to Luce until she sees Daniel. The moment her eyes land on Daniel, she is instantly drawn to him and wants to run to him, but why the instant connection? Why does Daniel seem so familiar and comforting to her... and when Daniel wants nothing to do with her and goes out of his way to make sure that she knows he has no interest it only increases Luce's curiosity to find out why he pushes her away and what secrets Daniel may be hiding. The mystery surrounding Luce and Daniel's pasts is consuming. A page-turner right from the start. We meet other students, Luce's new friends, Daniel's old friends, and at first I just wanted to dismiss them and wished that the story would just concentrate on their relationship. But as time goes on, these other characters play major roles in both of their lives. Not one person can be dismissed nor forgotten. Little by little, we find out why Luce was sent to Sword & Cross, what she can see, what her story is. We also find out why Daniel is so desperate to stay away from Luce. Daniel's story is heart breaking and you cannot help fall for for Daniel and want to hug him too. In the end, we finally hear the whole story that connects Daniel and Luce together... forever! because true love cannot be denied! I did find that the book was a bit choppy at times because it doesn't go into great details that I would have liked to have seen. But it doesn't keep the story from flowing. We are learning and experiencing everything as Luce is and I really liked that the author followed through with that. Now, let's get back to that first chapter! It's titled, In The Beginning and takes place in England, 1854. There are no names, the characters are referred to as ""He"" and ""She"". She is drawn to him everyday. He tries to stay away, but has a hard time doing so. He comforts himself by drawing pictures of her, it's obvious that he cares for her deeply. She doesn't know how or why, but she knows that she loves him and wants to be with him and makes it impossible for him to not cave in to her. And then he doesn't... They have their moment and we are left with a huge, oh my god! What just happened?! and of course, you need to know why. I really loved how the first chapter just draws you in by giving us a sort of tease... I have a huge soft spot for forbidden love.",Margarita Cortina
9780385739139,"Who doesn't love to read a story about boy and girl, love and hate, angel versus demon? If this sounds like the sort of book you'd like to curl up with on a couch, then Fallen, the first book of the series with the same name, is the book for you. Raised in Dallas and schooled in Atlanta, author Lauren Kate finished her M.A. in Creative Writing at UC Davis, where she also teaches. Her books have been translated into over thirty languages. She lives with her husband and currently works on the final book in the Fallen series, Rapture. Fallen is a story of seventeen years old Lucy, whose boyfriend died in unknown circumstances. As a result of this accident she must go to a juvenile detention educational facility - Sword & Cross School. When she enters the institute, she realized how much her life will change. Cameras watch her every move and discipline is strict. Just like her, it seems that other students have also their terrible secrets. On the first day she meets Arriane Alter, and both girls stick together and become good friends. When she meets Daniel, a brilliant student, her new life seems to get easier. She falls in love with him. This is where things get strange. Daniel is a fallen angel, he is in love with Lucy and every seventeen years he must re-suffer her death. Lucy seems to be immortal; she dies every time they meet, and is then reborn as a normal girl. However she doesn't remember her previous lives. Daniel is not the only fallen angel in the school. On her first day she met Cam, a handsome young man. Cam, like Daniel, is a fallen angel, however she does not know that both of them are the standards on the opposite sides of the ancient war of good versus evil. During her short time at Sword & Cross, Lucy must choose between finding out the truth that Daniel, Cam, Arriane and a whole bunch of others are hiding, or fighting for the love that she has felt ever since she saw Daniel. Fallen is a romantic and fantasy novel with elements of horror. From the beginning to the end the story is captivating and exciting. The main protagonists of the book are two teenagers. Fallen is mainly book for teenagers, but also more mature readers will find in it something for themselves. The setting of the old cemetery and the historic buildings of the school give an air of mystery to the whole story. The heroes in this novel are outcasts of society. Fallen angels, guardians of the innocent on the one hand, and dangerous warriors on the other. In these days, when the theme of vampires is almost worshipped, the idea of portraying fallen angels is a guarantee of success. I can strongly recommend this book to a fans of fantasy stories, such as, The Twilight Saga by Stephanie Meyer or The Mortal Instruments Saga by Cassandra Clare. After reading Fallen, there still is a certain hunger in us, questions haven't been answered, mysteries still abound. We are inexorably drawn to read the next book in the series - Torment. Find yourself a copy of this book and a comfortable sofa, and clear your weekend schedule.",Dr.Oasis
9780385739139,"It all starts with the prologue set in 1854, in which we learn something about the story's heart without being given any details. The embodiment of a teasing prologue! Then story sets back into present time where we attend Sword & Cross school together with Luce, from whose POV Fallen is narrated. Although she is just one of many troubled teenagers at Sword & Cross who have committed crimes, identifying with her felt very easy to me. The more she puts the blame for a murder on her, the more I want to prove her innocence. Luce is a protagonist, whose whole identity hasn't been revealed yet, which makes her interesting and mysterious. Beside this haunting murder mystery, Luce has to experience immediate rejection by Daniel, one of the dark Sword & Cross students, she feels exceptionally attracted to. The more Daniel pushes Luce away, the more Cam, a fellow new student, uses the chance to lull Luce into his irresistible charm. I considered Daniel and Cam as interesting counterparts, Cam the charming, active and almost angelic and Daniel the passive, cold and dark fighter. Both hold high tension potential, that not only Luce gets mesmerized by. I am not only eager to learn more about the future of each character and the mysteries that accompany them, but about Luce' and Daniel's past and the dark secret that lingers around their fate. My favourite symbolism lies in the application of shadows as enemies and the growing power of an ancient evil. Although the final enemy hasn't appeared yet, the threatening shadows produce an ever present awareness of the danger awaiting our favourite protagonists. I like Lauren Kate's pleasant writing style and the way she develops the story around Luce and Daniel, never giving away too much to hold the overall tension. She created a world in which every character seems to have an even darker secret than the other, you have to expect the unexpected every new page and in which you feel like a small feather in the infinite currents of heaven and the dark fires of hell. THE VERDICT It looks like Fallen is just the rising in a suspense curve about the quartet around Luce and Daniel. Go and get Torment, because you won't be able to stand the tormenting wait for the story to continue for long!",MissPageTurner
9780385739139,"Honestly I was a little hesitant to pick this book up, I had heard really good things about it but also really bad things. But in the end I decided to pick it up the other day to take it with me to the beach. I for one really liked this book I think it's original sure it has somethings in common with other books, but really someone show me a book that has absolutely nothing to do with another one. Luce is a pretty seventeen year old who is sent to Sword and Cross, a school for problematic children. She's not especially happy at giving away her mobile or the fact that ""the reds are watching her"" but she lives with it in a very mature way (me? I would be kicking and screaming and trying to hide things to keep^^) There she meets Cam a good looking boy who catches her attention by being nice to her, until Daniel Grigori appears, he seems like the perfect boy, until he flips her of and Luce has a feeling they've met before. I enjoyed the different characters and Arriane is the best!!! I also felt incredibly sorry for Penn (no spoilers)",Nathiel Gold

9780385739139,"honeslty. im not a picky reader, but this i did not enjoy one bit. when you look at the cover fallen it looks like an amzing book, also when you read the short description its sounds amazing..well its far from that. first complaint is its written in third person (which I am VERY picky about) a book that is 3rd person has to be really well written to get and keep my attention (such as City of bones(:) and Fallen completly failed at keeping it. I normally don't write bad reviews, and i hate writing them, but this book has an exception. I was SO excited to read Fallen, I knew when going into this book that the reviews were on either one side of the fence or the other..meaning either the person loved it or hated it. Fallen had a lot of potential to be amazing, but while reading the book all i could think of is ..wow there is way to many description on the scenry its giving me a headache . This book was not HORRIABLE, I have read worst (much worst) but i can say I still didnt like it and will not be reading Torment, or Passion. Please no one be upset over my review, I understand that there are thousands of people out there that LOVE the Fallen series, I for one am not one of them though. (I was hoping to be...) Random Note: I am getting so sick of all these Angel books (the ones that fail at least)",haley
9780373210367,"I just want to start off by saying, this has got to be THE BEST Iron Fey series book thus far! I loved all of Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey books, but this one has to be my favorite. The tension between Puck and Ash was, as always, hilarious. They kept each other afloat through the whole book, and you could see how loyal they were towards each other. You also learned about Ash, and his past, and what makes Ash, Ash. Ash's loyalty towards Megan was amazing, even after his surprise encounter with a past 'friend'. He sought his journey through to the very end, with a few bumps along the way. He encountered the Wolf yet again, and he was pretty funny with his and Grimalkin's encounters, always bashing each other. And, as always, Grimalkin just reminds me so much of the Cheshire Cat from Alice In Wonderland, just popping in and out of sight. I love how she (Julie Kagawa) described Ash's past and gave us, the readers, a better understanding of why Ash is just Ash. You got to see his temper, his love and his fears as the cold hard exterior of the Winter Prince started to fade and melt away. Puck delivered a great performance as the ever comedic faerie he is. Just a great comic relief that had me laughing many times throughout the book. I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars because of great writing Kagawa delivers again, I can't wait to read more of her work. http://www.bookdepository.com/?a_aid=jumintboo-20",Erin Nation
9780373210367,"The Iron Knight is the fourth and final book in the Iron Fey series and if you have yet to read these books, you have to get them! Ms. Kagawa's world building is excellent, her characters endearing and unforgettable and her stories are fantastic and filled with forbidden and all consuming love. While the first three books in the series were told from Megan's point of view, The Iron Knight is told from Ash's perspective and picks up shortly after the events in The Iron Queen. Megan is now queen of the Iron Realm but Ash cannot be with her there because the iron would kill. To be with the woman he loves, Ash embarks on an epic quest to abandon his life as a faerie and become mortal. While the first three books were awesome, I am so happy that Ms. Kagawa ended the series with this book! The Iron Knight gives us so much background on Ash, we truly get to understand how he became so cold and guarded, how he became friends and then enemies with Puck and just how much he really loves Megan. Even more profound, this book is also about being human, what it really means to love unconditionally and to give up everything, even life, for that love. It also brings to mind the fact that we are more than the choices and we have made and more than the sum of our past mistakes (yes, I just quoted a Tenth Avenue North song but it goes so well with this book, I could not get it out of my head while I was reading!). The Iron Knight is darker that previous books in the series and the Nevernever just a bit more twisted. The book also has more action, more emotion and is just an all around spectacular read. The Iron Knight is a completely satisfying conclusion to my all time favorite fey series. While I did feel like I was saying goodbye to old friends, I am looking forward to Julie Kagawa's new series, upcoming books, and pretty much read anything else she writes. Content: Implied sex, kissing, mild profanity and violence. My Rating: The Best!",Novia Chang
9780373210367,"I love this whole serie, but this book really got me in a way that blow my mind! This book was awesome, full of action and emotion. Oh my! The range of emotion that I was going thru while I was reading this book! I read a lot of YA book and this one was one of the most touching and disturbing that I read this year so far. Some chapters really brought me tears to my eyes and I'm not the kind of girl who cry while reading a YA book. I also read the other book from The Iron Fey serie and those kind of emotions didn't even burst! Well maybe the part about the reunion between Megan and his father was very touching but that was it. So I was surprise when I started to feel the tight throat and tears. I don't know if it was the author style, because she didn't change anything from the first book of the series. Maybe she felt more tragic for the last book. I love reading and discovering new kind of mythologic creatures and Julie Kagawa never stoped impressing me with her imagination and creativity about it. While reading The Iron Knight, you will meet again with Prince Ash, Puck, Grimalkin but you will encounters with new characters. These new characters are very important and will bring they contribution on the futur quest of the Prince Ash. The plot is a little bit disturbing: If Ash want to stay to Megan side he will have to get a soul and becomming a real human. If you read the entire series of the Iron Fey Series, you'll know that human a pretty despised in the Fey realm. But in the same time, what Ash wouldn't do to be with Megan again? That's really make the story : this whole quest will bring Ash and his friend to the End of the World and he will try to find a way to earn a soul. This book his really about Ash and we learn a lot about his own past. We learn what really happens to his former lover Arielle and the human girl he betrayed, Brynna. There was a lot of action and interesting adventure: I couldn't stop reading when I was in the middle of the action. Suspence, mystery, thrilling moments was from page one until the end really impress me. I didn't felt this way with the other books. I don't know if its the fact that the book is writing has Ash point of view, but I really considered it a plus. I recommend this book if you start that serie, if you want to know how all this story will end, you will fetch your own copy of The Iron Knight right away!",valerie
9780373210367,"At last, we are treated to Ash's story. Ash has been kicked out of the winter court, and he is also unable to be by Meghan's side. Meghan Chase is now the Queen of the Iron Fey, and like all other Fey, Ash cannot exist around iron. So, Ash makes a vow to Meghan and himself - he will find a way back to her if it's the last thing he does. After all, he has vowed to be her knight. This is a novel of constant action. There is almost never a moment where the reader can just sit back and go ""whew."" In THE IRON KNIGHT, Ash, with no doing of his own, assembles a band of the most unlikely companions. His bitter enemy, Puck, won't leave his side, no matter how fiercely Ash taunts him. The fickle cait sith, Grimalkin, ever complaining, joins in on the quest. Ash's mother sends surprise help, and a girl, long thought dead, assists as well. Ash realizes that the only way he can survive in the iron realm is to be mortal. With this group in tow, Ash seeks a rumored place where he will face perilous trials in an attempt to become mortal. He must give up everything he knows in order to honor his vow to Meghan. The trials that Ash faces are far too interesting to give away in a review. The tests he face make him seriously ponder his decision and decide once and for all whether being Fey or being with Meghan is more important. I've always been a fan of Ash, so I was extremely excited to see a novel devoted entirely to him. Of course, the bickering with Puck is here in full force, but there is much more to Ash than the cold, brooding nature that has been seen in the rest of the series. Ash is a strong, noble Fey bound and determined to keep a promise he made. I devoured the novel while at the beach and hope that this isn't the last of THE IRON FEY series. After all, there's still Puck to discover!",TeensReadToo
9780373210367,"I really enjoyed getting inside Ash's head, and it made me fall more not less like I was a little afraid of. The banter between Ash and Puck is amazing and keeps this moving when it could be a bit slow. Add Grimalkin to the mix, and you get a book that I couldn't put down. There are a few unexpected characters to drop in but by the end I fully appreciated them and they made an impression on me. I recommend this series highly!",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780373210367,"Ash, the former prince of the Winter Court has given up everything. His title of Prince, his home at the winter Court, even his vow of loyalty. And for what? All for a girl...a half human girl named Meghan Chase and it may all be for nothing. That is unless he can earn a soul and become human. Ash as an emotionless and cold faery Prince always saw love as a terrible weakness for only fools and mortals. His own ""one true love"" Ariella had died such a horrific death that it killed the gentler feelings that Ash had once had forever. Or he thought those alien feelings had gone forever until he set eyes on Meghan Chase. Meghan is half-human and as Oberon King of Summer's daughter she is also half fey. Meghan had smashed down the icy barricades that Ash had put up and he fell uncontrollably in love with her and binding him to her for all time. Ash swore an oath to be her Knight, but when all of Faery almost fell to the rule of the Iron Fey and then Meghan became the Iron Queen, she severed their bond to save his life. As no Summer or Winter Fey can survive in the Iron realm. So Ash begins a quest to obtain a soul to enable him to be at Meghans side in the Iron Realm for all of time. Accompanying him on his quest is Puck - the Summer Court prankster and good friend of Meghans and of course Ash if only they would admit to being friends! Also on the journey is Grimalkin the cat sith. Others also join him on the journey but to reveal them now would in my opinion spoil your enjoyment and surprises in the book, so I will try to keep spoilers out and be more generalised. To survive in the Iron Realm Ash needs to have a soul of his own and a mortal body. He faces impossible tasks to try to earn them. No one has ever returned from these tasks to tell the tale. Ash eventually learns a truth that turns reality upside down and challenges his deepest, darkest beliefs. Ash learns that sometimes it takes more than just courage to make the ultimate sacrifice. I had seriously high expectations for this book and yes some of them were met but the book also disappointed me in places too. The actual journey to the end of the wood/world seemed to drag in places as though it was being drawn out to make the book longer. Sorry and no disrespect to Julie Kagawa but that is how it felt to me and I always pride myself on giving my honest opinion in my reviews. Having said that I did still enjoy the book overall. I loved where Ash saw possible futures for himself and Megan, and saw them married and having a son etc. I loved the characters of Ash, and Puck and the others on the journey to the testing grounds. The friendships and ""fake"" animosity between certain characters was brilliantly written. I thought the actual tests that Ash went through were really well thought out and an excellent concept, showing him what he stood to lose if he chose to become a mortal.",Sandra Richardson
9781408309513,"This book was a nice introduction to the world of the Gallagher girls. Far from normal, these girls attend a school for geniuses training to become spies. Of course, they're still high school age so get up to all sorts of mischief just in a slightly different manner! I liked the plot of this book. It was simple but really fun to read about. I was on edge at times thinking characters were going to get caught and then if they did I was anticipating what was going to happen to them. It's definitely a fun read but the problem for me was that the writing didn't stick with me. I was a little put off by it for some reason and at times I felt like I was missing key details. I started to think it was me reading to fast so I would keep going back to read parts again to find that I hadn't missed anything. I really feel that this author has a very particular writing style that some people will really love and some people will just find okay. Make no mistake, it wasn't bad writing, it just wasn't suited to my likings. What I loved most about this book was how the characters interacted. It was made clear from the start that the Gallagher girls might as well be sisters and they are to be treated as such by each other. They're all growing up in the same environment totally different to normal teenagers their age so technically the only people they can depend on is each other. I loved that. It was such a strong aspect of the book and it shone through each and every character and still managed to accentuate how different each one of them was. Overall, this read was alright for me but some will enjoy it more. I definitely do want to have another shot at the second book in the series and see if it gets any better!",Maryam H
9781447273837,"Quick Blurb: Everyone sees it. Gabe and Lea are meant to be together. It's that simple. They couldn't be more perfect. Their roommates see it. Their friends see it. A creative writing professor, a deliver guy, siblings, a squirrel, classmates, a bench--they all see the same thing. But there's just one little problem. Gabe and Lea can't seem to pull it together, let alone hold a cohesive conversation. He's hiding behind his past and she's too reserved to actually speak more than monosyllable words. But if everyone else can see it, maybe Gabe and Lea can eventually figure out that they are in fact perfect for each other. They've got an entire year at college to figure it out, hopefully. It's a love story told through sixteen perspectives--none of which are Gabe and Lea's. My Thoughts: What a cute and original way to tell a love story. The sixteen perspectives make this book stand out from others in its genre. You aren't inside Gabe or Lea's head, experiencing the story from them. Instead, you witness it from everyone else's perspectives. In theory, sixteen perspectives could become quite confusing to follow. But it works. The story flows so that all the characters are independent. They're all so distinct and provide different insight on what's going on with Gabe and Lea's story. This book will warm your heart. The writing is simple, which will let you fly through the book. I read it in under a day and couldn't stop grinning, particularly reading certain perspectives--like the squirrel, Gabe's friends, or the professor who hardcore ships a relationship between two of her students. I highly recommend this story purely for its originality. It's a spin on the love story I've been waiting for--something a little different to pull you in and not let go until Gabe and Lea finally pull it all together.",Ryann Dannelly
9781250006325,"Torn is book two in Amanda Hocking's Trylle Trilogy, and it picks up right where Switched left off. After leaving the palace, Wendy returns home and this decision alone I think created a series of events that paved the way for a very action-packed and fun story. We get a deeper taste of the Trylle society in this installment, involving troll politics, moral clashes, and fantasy in a way that expanded this already huge series, and gives the reader a lot more to love. Amanda Hocking is a fantastic story teller, plain and simple. She creates worlds that are unbearably exciting and unique and characters that bring that world to life. In book two, however, we get to delve a little deeper into this particular world, and I think the most interesting aspect was the political ones and the ethical ones Wendy suffers from. In any society there's going to be a hierarchy. In Trylle Wendy suffers even more, because she isn't involved with just one kingdom this time around. The pull of both troll tribes were black and white if you ask me, and the complexity of this fantasy world amazed me. What would you do if you were princess? Would you fall into place and question nothing, or would you fight it and question everything? If you read book one you know which answer Wendy chose. I find her reluctance oddly endearing. She doesn't necessarily fit into either world, but she tries, and you can't deny that after reading this book. Just because she should do something or behave a certain way, doesn't mean she has to. I do wish she'd play her princess role up a bit more, because she might get more of what she wanted if she gave something in return. A little give might help her, but for the most part Wendy's highly fueled by wrong and right. Doing what's right to her is usually wrong to everyone else, but not once does she allow others to persuade her way of thinking. I will say that toward the end she seems to embrace her power after Elora explains why she's so important. My only criticism was the overall progression once the book is over. Though we move deeper into this world of trolls, sometimes I felt for a sequel we could have gone even deeper. When Wendy's at the palace things seem to slow down, and it isn't until she leaves does it speed up. Maybe it's because the danger level is heightened when she's away from the protection of the palace, but either way I wanted the strength book one had. Things picked up in the end, but there's a period in the middle where nothing happens. The romance, however, was my favorite part. It always is with any story, but there's something about Finn and Loki that kept my flipping the pages. I love Finn, of course, but I'm growing tired of his distance and his desire to remain loyal to the palace's order of hierarchy. Loki, on the other hand, was the opposite of Finn in every way, and I found myself just as drawn to him as Wendy. He's bold, charming, hilarious, and order isn't his thing. I don't expect any guy to turn his back on his world, but I do expect some compromise. Finn doesn't compromise, and I think Loki might have beat him out in this installment even with the shock at the end involving Tove. The relationships also grow tremendously in this book. Elora's indifference isn't exactly justified, but the reasons behind it have become clearer. She grew on me in a way I never thought she could. Her past unfolded in front our eyes and shined some much needed light onto who she is. Tove also got a bigger part, showcasing his amazingly cool abilities and we get to learn how deep Wendy's run and how powerful she really is. Overall Torn was a fantastic follow-up to Switched! Fans of Wendy, Finn, and these amazing trolls will no doubt be satisfied! I can't wait for book three!",Reading For Fun
9780141350868,"This is the first title bought and read on my first Kindle and what a book to start with. I had my eye on this title for such a long while leading to it's release but my pleas to review it for the publisher sadly led no-where.Along came my Kindle and I bought this book for it straight away with the price for the Kindle version being half that of the paperback and I'm so very glad that I did as for a debut novel by a new author it's a fantastic beginning to a brand new trilogy, The Half Life Trilogy. The book revolves around Nathan who's a 'Half Code', his father is a Black Witch and his mother was a Witch Witch. Basically it's the story of what kind of witch will Nathan become, will he be Black like his serial killer father Marcus or White like his dead mother and his, very much alive, half siblings. To say too much more than that would ruin the book for those who haven't read it yet. I have read lots of books with witches in before but this one is unique in the fact that none of the other books have treated the subject of the half 'breed' in this kind of way. Nathan is constantly treated with disdain over something he has absolutely no control over and that is his parentage, his heritage. As his father is the most evil Black witch ever known, Nathan is continuously presumed to follow in his footsteps regardless of anything he may do to the contrary and it's basically torturous for him to suffer through. You find your heart breaking for him over and over as you watch him being slowly pushed further and further away from his family, who he loves very much. The treatment he suffers is truly awful and not a pleasant subject to read about but it's a necessary part of the story. The book takes you through a whirlwind of emotions, from sadness to pity, from anger through to gladness which is a great achievement for a debut novel and author. I was a little worried about the writing style in the first chapter as it seemed like an odd way to write but thankfully it only lasted that first chapter and then the proper style took over. The story itself isn't shy in portraying the harder aspects of the tale and that is something I'm thankful for as it could have so easily been shined over if you know what I mean, the book needed a certain about of grittiness to it as Nathan's story is far from a happy one, at least to start with and by the end you have to wonder what on earth he's going to do with himself. Nathan is a wonderful character, hard as nails and a total fighter through and through but with such a soft centre, he cares for his family,the few friends he has and even the father he doesn't even know. He has a huge sense of self preservation which he needs to get him through each and every day but he also is incredibly curious about things he doesn't know, in particular when it comes to his mysterious father, who he has never met. It's a curiosity that is fully understandable as he feel he can't really understand himself and his Black heritage as he nothing to base it on especially as the rest of his family are all as White as they come. Sally Green has a lovely touch and an imagination that shines through on the page. Her writing style flows easily and she uses the sort of language typical to YA novels, I think I only had to look up words twice and that was simply as they weren't words I'd heard of before. Talking of words I was a but surprised by one characters use of her word to describe White witches that is a vulgar slang term we Brits use quite a lot, you all know what word I mean...... Shite! I was surprised by it's use especially as the author is British herself and must know of it's other use. End of the day it is a minor niggle and doesn't effect the book in any way. How I'm supposed to wait until next year for Half Wild I really don't know, I want to read it RIGHT NOW! No fair......... Unsure if it's a book for you then I would say in my opinion it would be a shame to miss out as it really is a fantastic read!",Thea Wilson

9781905654567,"The fourth book in the house of series, I have to say this is the best book so far in the series. Finally, the story has evolve into a much more interesting plot involving not just petty boy-girl, juvenile issues. In this book Zoey learns the value of friendship the hard way, she learns how to trust herself to be able to tap into her power more efficiently. I still find the main character annoying for having involving herself with too many guys thus making things much more complicated for her (although I say, it sometimes make things a lot more exciting, there's always something new happening). In this book, the story is no longer confined inside the House of Night school. More action takes place and will leave you on the edge of your seat trying to guess what's going to happen next. Zoey grandmother plays a vital role on how they were able to decipher Aphrodite's vision. Erik (her dreamy ex boyfriend fledgling turned vampire) in now back with the good side.

9781596435520,"Reason for Reading: I love a good ghost story! Brilliant creepy ghost story! Anya is a Russian immigrant highschool student. She's been in America since she was 5 so she's pretty much Americanized except for her name, but she doesn't see it that way. She feels as though she has to struggle to fit in at school, that her mother and her Russian cooking and ways are embarrassing, that she's expected to be friends with the new Russian nerdy kid is beyond endurance, especially since she only has one friend herself who is also an outsider. What with normal teen issues such as body image, a crush on the school's cutest guy and embarrassing herself in gym; it's not like she doesn't have enough on her plate. But then one day she falls down an open well in the woods and finds a skeleton and its ghost. The ghost comes along with her and becomes her new best friend, but what at first seems a sad, kind, helpful ghost turns into something much more sinister and Anya realizes she's put her whole family at risk. Absolutely loved this! The pace was perfect; it just slowly got creepier and creepier and watching the ghost's true self come out was a lot of fun. Anya was a great heroine; someone easily relatable to, with issues similar to all of us at that age. Do take note of the age recommendation (14+), the book is written about teenagers and contains material or references to topics that will not be appropriate for youngers.",Nicola Mansfield

While it may seem childish and immature at first it quickly develops as more characters are introduced. Even though it may seem like a children's book at first, it really isn't, its for people of all ages. Particularly adults, you cant help but be reminded of the innocence of childhood. At some point the book may touch onto more serious aspects of life but I wont spoil that for anyone.

9780140431025,"This is an omnibus of Jane Austen's unpublished novel, Lady Susan, with two unfinished novels, The Watsons and Sanditon. Lady Susan was written early in Austen's writing career, around the time she was writing Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey, and is in the format of letters. Lady Susan Vernon, finding herself in straitened circumstances after the death of her ailing husband, is forced to put her sixteen-year-old daughter into school and live with her brother-in-law, Charles Vernon, and his wife Catherine, at Churchill. Lady Susan is beautiful, charming and artful; her letters show she is also extravagant, scheming, manipulative and selfish, although she is adept at hiding this from those she seeks to influence. A very short novel, by Austen standards, and not a format that showcases her writing talent, this novel still amply illustrates her mastery of plot and character. The Watsons is a fragment of the novel written when Austen's family moved from Steventon to Bath, an unhappy period in her life. Emma Watson, youngest of the Watson girls, has lived with her aunt and uncle for fourteen years. When her uncle dies and her aunt remarries, her expected inheritance disappears and she has to return to the family home: an ailing father, and three sisters she does not know. Invited by well-off friends, the Edwards, to town and a ball, Emma meets a cast of characters who are to influence her future. The Watson family is a humble one by Austen's usual standards, although the heroine shows great promise and the plot has endless possibilities. While it is frustrating to not know the ending, the reading is, nonetheless, pleasurable. Sanditon is a fragment of the last novel Austen ever wrote, written at the time of Persuasion, Mansfield Park and Emma. A carriage accident in which Tom Parker sprains his ankle as he and his wife Mary are returning to the seaside town of Sanditon begins the long and important acquaintance between the Parkers and the Heywood family. The eldest Heywood daughter, 22 year old Charlotte, is exhorted to accompany the Parkers back to Sandition to benefit from taking the sea air and to bathe. What follows is Charlotte's impressions of the extended Parker family and the residents of Sanditon who are committed to making their town a popular vacation spot for families. The characters are comical and the plot has great potential; a great shame that it was unfinished due to Austen's illness and death. However short, the quality of the writing is still apparent.",Marianne Vincent
9780061566103,"Ian Thomas is in jail awaiting trial and the girls are able to relax and return to their lives. Or can they??? Just when the reader thought that the mystery of A has been solved at the end of UNBELIEVABLE, more bizarre events await the girls of Rosewood. Hanna, Spencer, Emily, and Aria slowly try to settle back into their normal lives. Hanna is working through the trauma of learning that her best friend tried to kill her. She tries to live with her soon-to-be step-sister, Kate, and build up new friendships at school. Spencer is dealing with the cold shoulder she is receiving from her family. And through her grandmother's will, Spencer has just learned that she might be adopted. Aria has ventured to an art exhibit on her own, only to learn that the guy she was maybe flirting with was the artist himself. And finally Emily has met a boy. A boy that sends tingles through her. The four girls still meet to discuss their grief and pull themselves together for the trial that is about to begin. But when Ian is released on bail to attend to his dying mother, the mysterious text messages start again. Each girl receives messages that are more haunting than the ones before Ian was arrested. Now, the sender seems to be stalking them. The messages are sent at the most inopportune times, and some even come with photos attached; photos that were taken mere moments before the text arrived. As the trial looms nearer, the girls are again thrust together trying to piece together the life that was Alison DiLaurentis. In WICKED, the reader gets a glimpse of the past and how the five girls initially became friends. The story hints at the Time Capsule and the flag pieces that bring the girls together. In WICKED, Ms. Shepard brings the reader even deeper into the intrigue that is Rosewood. Told in alternating voices by each of the girls, the pieces of the puzzle slowly start to come together. The wonderful thing about the PRETTY LITTLE LIARS series is that Ms. Shepard is able to lead the reader down one path, only to leave the ending wide open and wandering off in a different direction. With the shocking ending of WICKED, the reader will be waiting anxiously for the next installment, KILLER, due out in June 2009.",TeensReadToo

9780439706407,"Reason for Reading: One of my goals this year is to finally read this series! So, here I go! Volume One of the Bone series was everything I had hoped it would be. This has been on my must read list ever since Scholastic came out with the colourized editions, so that would make it six years of getting around to it. Happy to say I was not disappointed. The characters are adorable. The writing is funny, even witty, and an interesting journey has begun with a bad guy after one of our heroes for unknown reasons at this point. The Bone cousins, Phoney, Fone and Smiley have been run out of Boneville, crossed the desert, get lost in the mountains and are separated. We follow Fone Bone, who I believe is our hero, as he is certainly the most likable of the three, as he finds a valley and meets the people and creatures there while he searches for his missing cousins. So far my favourite characters are Fone, of course, Ted the bug, Gran'ma Ben and the Red Dragon. Sometimes when one has heard nothing but praise for a book (or series) over the years, once you actually get to reading it yourself there is a bit of a letdown.

9781442403543,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2012/07/03/review-city-of-fallen-angels-by-cassandra-clare/ I am glad that Cassie Clare decided to extend The Mortal Instruments. You might be asking me why I feel that way. Originally I thought the Mortal Instruments series was an okay series; the idea was original, but not so much the plot. But oh my gosh, City of Fallen Angels surpassed its prequels. The plot became so much more complex with this new installment in the series. Cassie's writing style has improved, I think, and the surprises she throws you every which way will throw you off guard, beyond a doubt. You'll be dying to know who the new villain is (or do you already know the villain?), and finally when you find out, you're left with that cliffhanger ending that will leave you itching to get your hands on City of Lost Souls, the sequel. I definitely liked the characters in City of Fallen Angels more too. Clary is no longer that Mary Sue (ugh, I hate those perfect girls); Jace has been teaching her how to be a Shadowhunter, so now she knows how to kick butt! Or, well, sort of. But runes are still her calling, you know. Jace is still, well, Jace. The epitome of a bad boy that stays sweet to those he loves. And Simon! Ah, I used to hate Simon-he was really annoying back in the first few books-but now Simon has cooled his sarcasm (slightly) AND he might be dating two girls. Poor guy, too shy to tell which of them he's going out with. And the romance! I love Clary and Jace together; now that they know the truth about their heritage, they don't have to worry about that pesky problem of incest ... And Simon's relationship with Isabelle and Maia is also really cute (though he's bound to get in trouble). I'm not on either team, really, though I get the feeling that Simon might end up with Isabelle. Hmm. There were some new characters too! I'd always liked Camille in the Infernal Devices series (Cassie's prequel series to The Mortal Instruments), though she scares me sometimes, being a vamp and all. I was pretty cool with Jordan too, though at first his backstory made me hate him. City of Fallen Angels is a delightful installment of the Mortal Instruments series, full of more twists and turns than can ever be imagined. I applaud you, Cassandra Clare.

9780142415917,"After finishing Graceling, I immediatley jumped into Fire although I was curious to see how I would find it; I knew it was a companion novel and thus doesn't direclty deal with the same characters and events in Graeling, but I was optimistic that Kristin Cashore could lure me in to this new story! Thankfully, I wasn't wrong about that- and I don't think I could pick a favourite out of Fire or Graceling. I adored them both, but for very different reasons :) But Fire clearly establishes Kristin as an author to be watched and one of the best found in modern YA. Reasons to Read: 1.A book that stands all on its own: Fire doesn't rely on anything from Graceling to make it a great book; it easily stands all on its own as a new favourite, with diverse & fascinating characters and an equally intriguing storyline. Moreover, I was impressed that Fire stood out as a completely separate story from Graceling. I was wary that the storylines and characters would be eerily similar to those found in Graceling and was pleased when I discovered that they weren't! There is one thread that remains familiar between the two, but ultimately the pair give us a fuller sense of the world Fire and Katsa live in. And even the Dells is such a different world from the one encountered in Seven Kingdoms. 2.But it keeps the good elements of Graceling: Books like this can also turn out another way, when they strike gold once and then try so hard to be different in the second book that they completely miss what made them so enjoyable in the first place. This isn't the case with Fire. You still have contemporary issues being discussed in a fantasy world, plenty of action, romance, and an high stakes. ALSO: I need to add here that I'm a HUGE fan of natural, slow-building, gradual romances. I found that (and loved it) in Graceling and Fire has that as well, so that's a HUGE win in my books! :) 3.A focus on relationships: Fire features a large number of extraordinarly complex and interwoven relationships, something that I found particularly interesting to read about and seems to be a partial focus of the story. It's fascinating seeing how these characters interact with one another and how they react differently towards others, and it's these relationships that truly set the stage for the rest of the novel. It's truly a remarkable feat to capture such realistic portrayals of relationships and interactions between people in writing. 4.Fire & Brigan are NOT Katsa & Po: It's understandable that a comparison between these four would be made, but I was relieved to find out that they are completely different types of people with rather opposite personalities. Marriage makes Katsa nervous and she's more focused on her actions and what she can actively accomplish; Fire desires commitment and a family more than anything, but she fears it as well and puts a lot of time into thinking things through. Similarily, Po and Brigan are different types of men as well. But there are a couple of similarities: Katsa and Fire are both unique, and fear this uniqueness they hold more than anything. Po and Brigan show their love by being supportive and encouraging rather than trying to control. Kristin Cashore's books are so rich in detail and familiarities that it's hard to believe aren't real, and that this is a fantasy world. But the issues she raises (love, relationships, sex, female empowerment, etc.) aren't foreign to us and I think this is where their true impact lies.",Brenna Staats

9781416939214,"I first read this for English class in school back in the mid-90s and it has always stuck with me. I have been meaning to buy it for a long time and just never got around to it but it is being made into a movie due for release next year, so I figured I should get to it before then. It is almost exactly as I remembered it, even after about 20 years and I think this is the book that started my love for post-apocalypic fiction. Ann has been doing very well surviving by herself on her family's farm, after her family and most the world is killed after nuclear attack. Everyday she works hard to survive - fishing, hauling water form a stream, milking the cow, collecting eggs and working the land. She has gotten used to her routine and the solitude and quietness, all that changes after she sees smoke from a campfire in the distance. The lone stranger slowly gets closer and closer in his radiation suit, and so, for precaution, she moves her stuff into a cave. From the safety of the cave she watches as the man camps on her farm and as he makes a deadly mistake. Putting caution aside, she goes to the man and nurses him through sickness. At first, Ann is excited for the company and even plans their future together but that quickly changes as Mr Loomis gets better and it becomes apparent that Ann is at risk from something other than radiation. The story is told through Ann's diary and this helps to make the events seem more immediate and tense. She is a likeable narrator, though at times she is naive but considering her somewhat sheltered upbringing that is understandable. Ann is such a strong, intelligent and resourceful young woman, and you can't help but feel proud of her for what she has accomplished and feel sympathy for her when she loses what she worked so hard for. The story Mr Loomis is a sad one, you feel the hope of a possible future right along with Ann and then devastating disappointment and fear when his true nature is revealed. As I was reading, I kept hoping that it was just the illness making him act the way he does and that he would eventually get better, be normal and he and Ann can be happy together. I kept hoping this even though I knew exactly how it ended. This novel isn't only about surviving in a post-apocalyptic world but a story about fortitude and survival versus humanity. It raises questions of what would you do in Ann's situation - would you be able to survive on your own with no electricity (and no books *GASP*) and would you remove the problem or remove yourself from the problem like Ann did? It might be easy to say to yourself, as you read, that you would just kill the crazy son of a gun, but could you, in all honesty end another human being's life, if there was another way out? I personally think that my self-preservation would trump my humanity in that situation, but hopefully, I will never have to find out.",Natalie Johnson
9781416939214,"Sixteen-year-old Ann Burden has been living on her own for a year, since the nuclear bombs turned everything surrounding her little valley into a wasteland, and her parents drove out to find other survivors... and never came back. Knowing she may be the only person left, Ann struggles with her loneliness and tends to the farm as best she can. But then a man comes over the hills in a protective suit and arrives in the valley. At first he provides Ann with welcome companionship, but as he recovers from a bout of radiation sickness, his actions become more sinister. Z FOR ZACHARIAH is an intense, heart-pounding read. From the moment Ann first sees smoke rising from beyond the valley, each development wrenches her further and further from the life she's adjusted to--seemingly for good, and then with terrible consequences. The pacing is perfect, and with the story being told through Ann's journal entries, every event feels immediate. The personal details and unflinching descriptions of life after a nuclear war make the story even more gripping. As the tension escalates, readers will find it incredibly hard to put the book down before they discover Ann's ultimate fate. While the story leaves this somewhat open-ended, Ann's ultimate victory will make them cheer. Ann is a likable narrator, with a natural voice and a well-developed personality. It's easy to sympathize with her based on her situation alone, but she is all the more admirable for refusing to give up even in the most desperate circumstances. She deals with her problems with intelligence and courage, but still has those moments of carelessness and fear that make her human. Readers will be on her side from the beginning, even as they struggle to imagine how they would feel in her place. Though her final triumph involves some loss, it's clear Ann will persevere and find a way to survive and be happy, which makes the ending satisfying. Z FOR ZACHARIAH is a story that will haunt readers long after they've put down the book. It shows both the good and the bad that can emerge from human nature in the face of catastrophe, and gives hope that even in the worst situations, there are those who will remain strong.",TeensReadToo

To be Honest, i never liked reading and hated it to death but when i picked up this book, it was just amazing to read. I rather choose this book over Twilight, but i feel like Amanda Hocking's books are a bit rushed and need a bit more detail. Most people dislike this book, and remember a book isn't made for everyone. I'd recommend this to mainly teenagers though.",Rosie
9781250006318,"5/5 STARS! Amanda Hocking has a special style of writing. It's honest, to the point, and extremely beautiful. Her imagination is unique, and I have faith she will be a long lasting addition to the Young-Adult genre. I loved her before I read Switched, but now, there is no doubt in my mind that she's one of my favorite authors. She creates worlds that are overflowing with magic, wonderment, love, and originality. There's nothing like Switched out there, and I'm so glad that the whole world will get a chance to read it now. Switched introduces us to Wendy Everly. We quickly learn that she's not like everyone else, and that has nothing to do with the fact that her mother tried to kill her at her sixth birthday party. She's temperamental, strong-willed, and never seemed to fit in like everyone else. After being kicked out of her last school she's determined to make this move count for her aunt and brother. But there's a new guy in her class, and he won't stop staring at her... Let's start with Wendy. It's been a long time since I've connected this forcefully with a main character. Wendy was everything I ask of. She was opinionated, indecisive, real, loyal, loving, strong-willed, and never allowed anyone to change how she felt. I loved her relationship with her brother Matt and her Aunt, because once they're out of her life it's hard to imagine her being allowed to love anyone. Her new life is cold and political, and I loved how she seemed more human than Trylle when everyone around her insisted otherwise. Her duties as a Princess collided painfully with her own wishes, and I found myself feeling her frustration and sadness. I don't know what I would have done in her situation, and I think she handled it better than anyone could have asked of her. I also fell in love with Finn. I absolutely loved the slow progression of their relationship, and the intense sense of forbidden love that surrounds them. Wendy can't have Finn, and that makes me want them to be together even more. He was strong, sexy, dangerous, and loyal. He's definitely on my radar now, and I don't plan on letting him slip past. Overall Switched was fantastic. There was everything you'd need to fall in love: A sizzling romance, an original fantasy world, characters that were strong, well-crafted, and interesting, action that kept you on the edge of your seat, and an ending that left me salivating for the next book. I would absolutely recommend this.",Reading For Fun
9781250006318,"Switched by Amanda Hocking is a beautiful and enchanting paranormal novel about a species I've never read about before in YA -- the Trylle! Which is basically a prettier way of saying ""troll."" Hocking does a great job creating an entirely new mythology about the Trylle and their way of life. Everything about them is explained clearly throughout the book, and I loved being able to learn about their way of life alongside the main character, Wendy. Wendy was relatable, and I liked her. She always felt like she was different from the kids at her school, and even different from her family. Her mother hates her and tried to kill her when she was six years old, but she has a loving aunt and brother. I really liked her aunt and brother, and hope to see more of them in the next books in the trilogy. When Wendy goes to live with the Trylle, she discovers in a very Princess Diaries-like way that she is a Trylle princess and is next in line for the throne. The book from that point on reminded me of a fairy tale, with the girl who is learning how to be a princess and feels like she just can't manage to do it right. If you love enchanting fairy tales, then this will definitely be a book for you! Just like in many YA books, there were many guys vying for Wendy's affections! There was Finn, the hot Trylle who Wendy is forbidden to be with; Rhys, the hot human who is interested in Wendy but she is even more forbidden to be with; and Tove, the hot royal Trylle who would be an appropriate match for Wendy. I can't wait to see how her relationships with these three develop in the rest of the trilogy. I like them all, and I'm not even sure what ""Team"" I'm on yet! In conclusion, Switched is an enchanting tale that I loved and highly recommend. There was also a huge cliff hanger at the end -- I need the next book NOW! On the cover: The cover for Switched is gorgeous. The Trylle Trilogy has been on my to-read list for a while, but when I saw the new covers designed by St. Martins Press, I was amazed by their beauty. The cover represents the enchanting feeling of the book perfectly!",Michelle Madow
9780373210268,"Fearing the inevitable death of her mother Kate strikes a deal with a man she just met, Henry or Hades, god of the underworld. She has to take a few tests to prove worthy of becoming Henry's new queen in order to save her mother. I was looking forward to an impressive test marathon. These kind of stories with game character are often very active and daring and belong to my favourites, like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. THE GODDESS TEST didn't make use of all its possibilites. No grand arena, or crazily exciting tests to endure. The tests are nothing spectacular and often even passed by Kate without us knowing or being told. Greek mythologies are full of quarrels and tests, wars and epic love stories and I was drawn to THE GODDESS TEST after reading its summary. I was disappointed to find out Kate and Henry's story was nothing like that. Henry's still in love with his wife Persephone. I appreciated his honesty but ignoring Kate and keeping something important from her is just no way to treat your potential partner and so I just couldn't think of Henry as a genuine love interest. Their romance is defined by the ever same circle of arguments, whiny statements, excuses, I couldn't hear it any longer. 3,5/5 ***/* THE GODDDESS TEST - A Greek mythology YA debut for beginners. Kate's story was one that had so much potential, especially with the tests she has to pass in order to save her mother. THE GODDESS TEST is a well-written debut and even though I wasn't overly enthusiastic about its characters and their romance, its world building and Greek mythology background made for a promising sequel.",MissPageTurner

""You are still living. The others on the grounds died very long time ago."" A chill ran through me. ""And you?"" ""Me?"" The corner of his mouth twitched. ""I rule the dead. I am not one of them"" About The Book: Kate's mother is dying and her last wish is to move back to her childhood home. How she can say no even if she's starting a new life, with no friends, and fearing her mother's death? She starts her new life there but a girl's prank turn out with her death and Kate decides to safe her. How? She makes a deal with a stranger. Even though the girl was mean with her, she tries to safe her and that's why Henry claims her to be the queen of the Underworld. Kate thinks that's another prank, but when Ava dies again, this time with no return, she decides to try to safe her. Instead she's finds another deal: keep her mother alive until she's prepared to say goodbye, if she takes the test. When dealing with the God of the Underworld could be an easy task, Kate finds out that he's not the only God around her and the astonishing thing is that she doesn't even know. What Kate doesn't know either is that every girl who had taken the test had died. If she fails, it's not her life that's only at risk... ""I care,"" he said in a trembling voice. ""I care so much that I do not know how to tell you without it seeming inconsequential compared to how I feel. Even if I am distant at times and seem as if I do not want to be with you, it is only because this scares me, too."" Review: I had this series on my to-read shelf and it was about time I give it a shot. It turns out that I'm in love with this books. Aimee Carter not only finds the way to keep the story with sense and interesting for the reader, but adds a little of Greek mythology in it. Thing that I love. It was nice to see a good Hades, God of the Underworld, tormented by the loneliness that Persephone left in his heart. You could think that being a God is an easy task, but keeping the Underworld in order is taking everything from Henry and he wants a partner with him, to help him and to ease that loneliness. To be at Henry's side, each candidate must take a test and pass it. The trouble in that? No one knows who is killing the candidates and what seemed an easy task, turns out to be a deadly test. However this time is not only the candidate, Kate, that will die. Henry has made an ultimatum. If Kate does not succeed, he'll let himself vanish forever. Because Gods don't die, they vanish, with no turning back. Kate was a brave and strong character that even though she's not in the obligation of saving a girl who was nothing but mean with her, she safes her and that's what brings Henry's attention. She's a good girl with a big heart and she even cares for Henry. Although we can understand her distress at first, when someone, from out of the blue, claims to be Hades, God of the Underworld, and that he wants you to be Persephone 2.0, can be a little bit stressful and made you judge the sanity of that person. Henry is the tormented character with the little hope of finding a partner to share the Underworld. He's not asking for love, but for caring. He's sweet, but distant and is the one that keeps the mystery in their relationship. James, on the other hand, is supposed to be geeky, but handsome. He truly cares for Kate and he's really cute and friendly. When we found out his secret, we were like OMG! That one we didn't see it coming. However we were glad to know that he'd be around for a while (*wink*). We had mixed feelings with Henry and James, so we would keep them both! As for Ava, she's mean at first, but then she changes completely. She's more sweet and a little bit childish, but is something that suits this character. We don't know how to explain it, but she's a sexy, but childish character that brings the fun to the friends relationship in the story. With a terrific and wonderful plot and fantastic and original characters, this story is full of unraveling twists and unexpected secrets that would captivate you from the first page. Not only we have romance and mystery, but we can see a peek of supernatural and being truthful to the original mythology. We can only tell you that we have already read the other three books of Kate's story. So don't hesitate, Book Addicts, and read this marvelous story full of Greek Mythology. ""Maybe you'll win when hell freezes over."" He raised an eyebrow. ""That could be easily arranged.""",TUABFC
9780373210268,"I had a lot of problems with this book. This is the first book since I've started blogging where I not only didn't enjoy it, but was also kind of angry with as well. The author's writing itself isn't that bad, but it's not very good either. She has the tendency to use YA clich????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Â©ï¸s, over-complicates her story to the extreme, and sets up her characters like Edward and Bella from Twilight. Except worse. Right off the bat, the first chapter was pretty cheesy. Over-dramatic Henry acts like this the entire book. ""It's all my fault,"" ""My life sucks,"" ""I didn't protect her"" blah blah blah. Plus, just because a character is a god, doesn't mean they can't have personality. Every single character was shallow, under-developed, and lacked depth. Believability When we are introduced to Kate, I kind of liked her. She was a little whiny, but I thought she was alright. Then everything went off the deep end. First, the most popular girl in school (who is an immediate bitch, what a surprise!) Ava, pranks Kate in the worst possible way and ends up dying. Only it's okay, because Henry can bring Ava back to life, for a price. So yeah, this is the part where Kate should be kind of questioning this guy on how he raised her friend from the dead. Nope, instead she looks up the story of Hades and Persephone like Henry told her to, and doesn't even clue into the fact that he's Hades. Like, legit Hades, not symbolically, allegorically, metaphorically, whatever. That piece of information goes right over her head, even when Ava is walking around, alive, without her brain bashed in like it was before. Now, all this stuff happens really fast, right at the beginning. When Kate moves in with Henry, all of a sudden everything is at a standstill. Things move at a snail pace. Most of it is Kate figuring out whether or not she likes Henry, and then she ends up loving him (shocker), which I didn't understand because the build up to their romance was non-existent. The author told her audience about Kate's feelings, rather than showing them. Gender Stereotypes Kate has servants, and when one of them asks her to wear a dress (when she doesn't want to), instead of putting up a fuss, she just gives in. She even has a to wear a corset. Umm, so much for feminism. Let's subjugate our character to physiologically altering lingerie for the purpose of being pretty and skinny. This isn't the end to the gender stereotypes that permeate this book, either. Henry is so over-protective, and Kate constantly reacting to him. He's active, she's passive. He's in a bad mood, it makes her sad (but she barely knows him). She agrees to all these tests to prove herself capable of being his queen. Ugh. The whole thing is setting this girl up to the be the perfect ideal of a woman by passing these tests, which are the seven deadly sins. Um, I don't remember Henry/Hades having a perfect track records, or for that matter, any of the Greek gods. They mess up each other's lives throughout Greek mythology. But by subjugating Kate to these tests, it's only promoting this concept of an ""ideal"" woman, that nobody can actually be. Another thing was her skinny-ness. At one point she says, ""I didn't gain weight, and that only gave me an excuse to eat as much as I wanted."" (page 135). You should always be able to eat as much as you want, and not have to constantly worry about weight loss or gain. If you're a healthy person, with an active lifestyle and good food choices, then that shouldn't matter! Whenever I eat, I want to have a full meal. That's how much I want to eat. I shouldn't need an excuse to do that! Plot So the whole idea is for Kate to stay alive, and all the girls that have gone before her have died terrible deaths, and no one knows who is behind them, and for some inexplicable reason, Kate is the last girl before Henry ""fades."" Why he's suddenly fading is beyond me. It doesn't sound like he has it that bad. Lots of friends, some nice family members, but he's severely depressed because Persephone left him thousands of years ago. Okay... Anyways, so no girl has stayed alive past Christmas. Kate gets past it with barely a hitch. And then she's in the clear. She makes clear, moral decisions that anyone would have probably made in her place, but she's exalted for it in the end because apparently they were so hard to pass. Later on some serious stuff happens, but the whole time I'm screaming mentally at Kate, are you blind?? The whole story just did not make sense in my brain. In the end... This book really fell short of my expectations. The plot was so over-complicated with characters making decisions that really made no sense whatsoever. Henry and Kate are Edward and Bella cookie cutters, except Kate is really desperate for Henry's love for some reason, and Henry is a depressed robot. Kate is subjected to age old gender assumptions and just lets it all slide. Apparently feminism doesn't apply to Greek mythological retellings. I know some people really enjoyed these books, but I would personally not recommend them.",Janita Van Dyk
9780373210268,"My opinion about this book is kind of complicated... Although I loved it and almost finished it in a day it lack a few things that I considered important for the plot. For instance, the background story was very good, Aimee did an amazing job bringing the old myths to the present time and making them very appealing. Especially Henry (AKA Hades), a character always misunderstood by people who picture him as a terrible god, capable of doing horrible things and ruler of Hell. But the Underworld has nothing to do with christian's hell and Hades has nothing to do with demons or Lucifer. So, as I said, Henry's personality was good and believable, he had all the things necessary to create a tortured character that will appeal to everyone. His background history is so heartbreaking that I did cry for him a little bit. As for the other gods, since I don't do spoilers I can't say too much about them, sorry. Kate's character was also amazing. Her relationship and the love she shared with her mom was very sweet and warm, I admire Kate's willingness to put her life on the line for the sake of the people she loves. One of the things I liked the most was to see her develop her personality as the plot unfolded revealing a fitting girl to become a queen. I really enjoyed to see Kate and Henry's relationship develop little by little, no rush, no insta-love and no silly things getting in their way. They both gave what they could in every situation and by the end of the book the support they showed for each other was great. But as far as the tests go I was not very happy. I understand what the author tried to accomplished with these tests that the future queen of the Underworld would have to face but I really wanted to see Kate going to each and every one of them... and it never happened. So yes, that was a disappointment. Saying that I also have to point out one very important thing: the ending was SUPERB. The identity of the gods and the truth behind the tests blew me away and kept me reading until the last page no-stop. Overall I think the book was good and the ending, that doesn't finish with a cliffhanger, well thought. That's why the next book, Goddess Interrupted, is already in my TBR pile. If you like Greek mythology then this book will please you for sure.",Alaiel Kreuz
9780373210268,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2011/05/24/review-the-goddess-test-by-aimee-carter/ Books based on Greek mythology have taken a backseat ever since the huge outburst of paranormal romances. And it's a pity, because Greek mythology is one of my favorite parts of fiction. Just trying to remember all the names - from Acheron to Zeus - is what makes it so satisfying for me. The Goddess Test was a bit different from what I normally expect of mythological fiction. Instead of embracing the traditional Greek names of the gods, Aimee Carter adopted American names for each. Hades became Henry, and the other gods whom I will not name (no spoilers!) had Americanized names too. Even the characteristics of the Greek gods were Americanized. They were modern. They were not traditional. And I don't like that. I tend to be more oriented around tradition. Maybe it's because of my being educated in a conservative private school. I don't know. But I like sticking to the same old. And I admit that change is good for you, except sometimes too much change can ruin the entire thing. So basically, I wasn't a big fan of how the gods had changed in this book. But on the other hand, I did love our protagonist, Kate. Kate was pretty. Sweet. Nice. Caring. Determined. Devoted to her mother. At times, I paused and thought that she seemed a bit like a Mary Sue, except I truly did like her character. She was strong-willed, though not kick-butt like my other favorite heroines. But she was determined to keep her mother alive and to pass her test of becoming a goddess. And that's what I loved most about her. I enjoyed the romance in this book between Kate and Henry, though I thought it was a little abrupt at first. These two had a rocky relationship at first, and suddenly they were kissing? I was just a bit surprised. But I took it well and read to the end, where I was left with the feeling that these two may have been meant for each other, despite their relationship's complications. Oh, and the mystery! The mystery! I've always been a big fan of mystery, and this book did not disappoint in that area. I always caught myself thinking, ""Who's killing all these girls trying to pass the test?"" And when the murderer was finally revealed, I admit that I was surprised. Never would I have suspected that (ahem) would be the one behind all these killings! The Goddess Test was a very modern take on ancient Greek mythology. Even with its ups and downs, I loved watching as one determined girl fell in love and showed the nature of a true goddess.",Linda
9780373210268,"The Goddess Test was a book I, initially, wasn't interested in reading, but when I was offered a review copy along with a copy of Goddess Interrupted, to be reviewed at my leisure, no pressure, I accepted. And I'm really glad I did. I hadn't realised I was missing out on a fantastic book. This has become one of my favourite series. I was caught up from the first few pages and I just couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed the mythology in this book. It is loosely based on the story of Hades and Persephone. Having never had much interest in mythology, I really know very little about it. I've learned some in the last few mythology based books that I've read. This was very easy to keep up with though. I didn't feel like I was getting lots of mythology information thrown at me to try to remember throughout the book which I have in the past. Our protag, Kate, agrees to spend the Autumn and Winter with a stranger, Henry, in exchange for the life of her friend. Her mother is dying and she doesn't want anyone else around her to die. She figures she will have very little in her life once her mother dies anyway as she has spent the last four years nursing her mother. The world that Kate creates around Eden Manor is fascinating and exciting, I really enjoyed being immersed in it. Kate finds herself living among the dead and enjoying it. There is some mystery too. Someone wants Kate dead, and has killed the eleven girls who were there before her. Kate has ladies in waiting, a food taster and personal guards. She is rarely left alone. During the six months that she stays with Henry, she must pass a total of seven tests, then she can become immortal, Henry's wife and the Queen of the Underworld. Then she will be required to spend the autumn and winter of every year for eternity with Henry, but for the other six months, she can do as she pleases. I really liked Kate. She steps up to the mark for other people constantly. Even when she has no real feelings for Henry, she wants to pass the tests for him, so she can see him happy and keep him from fading. She is fair when she has to judge and treats people equally. I liked Henry too. But when he was first introduced, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be a good or bad guy. Was he just a jailer who would lock a young girl away for six months of her life. After all, he had kidnapped Persephone. Henry was quiet and distant with Kate at first but he made sure she was comfortable and had everything she required. She just couldn't leave the grounds of Eden Manor. He was always kind and friendly, with a sadness about him, and I really warmed towards him. He is still deeply in love with Persephone and heartbroken over her leaving him. He tugged at my heart strings, but I also felt for Kate, as she really tries hard to get close to him. The interaction and relationship between Kate and Henry was well done and I enjoyed it thorougly. Things move really slowly and we see Kate making most of the advances, which was different. There is an enemy within the walls who wants Kate dead and it was interesting to find out who it was and the reason behind it. But Kate does make a couple of good friends in Ava and James. The ending has a few twists and turns, some of which I did see coming. From the way this ends, I do have a small concern going into the next book, a love triangle. I really hope not.",Suzanne Finnegan
9781408319505,"Through the first half of the book I could't help myself but wonder, how will Teri Terry wrap it all up in so little time and space? Man, I was so wrong. She's done it perfectly. SO perfectly I was speechless till the end. Well, with the occasional crying and sobbing. Cause I did cry. This is one of the best dystopian books I've ever read. And that's a fact. Kyla. Rain. Lucy. Riley. I'll stick with Kyla. This girl, I cannot believe all that she went through and she was still standing. We can call it courage, but I will call it determination. Wow. Really, Kyla in this book was totally badass. Gone is the scared girl full of doubts and fears. In this book we are faced with a Kyla who is strong, determinated, courageous, brave, smart and still fast at running. I actually changed my mind about the boy.. and that doesn't happen often ;) The writing was stunning! And so realistic. Really, I could see it in my mind. Everything, and let me tell you, it was pretty terrifying. I could feel my heart beating so fast, the adrenaline pumping through my body and the feeling was as scary as it was exhilarating! And I quite forgot how amazing it feels to look at the clock and see it 5am and not being bothered about it at all. Some thing are worth it. And Shattered definitely is! Shattered is an amazing conclusion to an amazing trilogy! Slated was awesome, Fractured was incredible, but Shattered takes the whole serie to a whole new level.

9781907411588,"I have yet to read Gail Carriger's The Parasol Protectorate series but I was very curious to see what her spin-off series for teens would be like. Etiquette & Espionage ended up being an intriguing read by the end, although I wasn't too sure about it for the first half. Reason to Read: 1. An endearing adventure: By the end of the book, I was quite taken in with this fun little story. The characters and world charmed me, with their quirks and fascinating little details. I liked Sophronia's spunky, tomboy personality and how she finds a way to apply herself to her learning... in her own unique way. I love that the characters in this story are a little bit different and very normal - perfect for readers to relate to. While the book ended up being a lot of fun for me, it took me a while to come around and appreciate it. I don't think this spin-off series is the best place to start for those who haven't read The Parasol Protectorate series. I felt very lost and confused at first, because the world was so unfamiliar as was the language used. I needed more explanation and it just wasn't there, so the world felt disappointingly underdeveloped to me. But at the same time, for much of the book Etiquette & Espionage felt more like a middle grade read as opposed to a young adult book. Sophronia is 14 in the book, and while I think this would be a great book for many middle grade readers I'm not sure it has much crossover appeal for those who liked Gail's adult series. The book felt very young at first, although by the end it seemed to venture closer to standard YA territory. That being said, I enjoyed Etiquette & Espionage even if it wasn't quite what I was expecting. By the end I felt like I had found my rhythm with this book so that I had a better sense of the world structure.

9781907411588,"I'm a big fan of Gail Carriger's books so when I heard she was writing a YA series I was beyond excited. I immediately fell in love with all of the characters. I thought Sophronia made a brilliant heroine whilst still being a young girl and acting as such. She had a great personality that made me laugh quite a few times right from the very beginning of the book - I really can't wait to see more of her in the next one. The plot was a little simpler than I would have liked but enjoyable nonetheless. I found this book enjoyable mostly due to Carriger's impressive writing style. There really is no end to the humour, wacky scenarios and quirky characters in any of her books. Overall this is a very quick, light hearted read that will make you giggle. I really enjoyed it just as much as the other books by this author so I sincerely recommend both this read and Gail's other books.",Maryam H
9780545055871,"Welcome to the suburbs of Australia as seen through the eyes of author Shaun Tan. This collection of fifteen stories is creatively written and illustrated. A comment on the last page mentions that the book was created with the assistance of ""the Australian Government through the Australia Council, its arts funding and advisory body."" Not only are readers presented with tales inspired by humor and often bizarre events, but they are also treated to unique, eye-catching artwork with each story. One story, titled ""Stick Figures,"" asks readers to imagine twig-like creatures that roam the neighborhoods. Their stick bodies and sod heads are magical and mysterious. ""Eric"" is a foreign exchange student like no other you can imagine. His view of our world and the things he takes from it will make readers look more closely at the little things in their everyday lives. ""Distant Rain"" is created on bits and scraps of paper. It presents the idea that all the snippets, phrases, and sound bytes people encounter daily might all blend together in a massive ball like bits and pieces of poetry. ""A vast accumulation of papery bits that ultimately takes to the air, levitating by the sheer force of so much unspoken emotion"" will have readers appreciating the written and spoken word on a whole new level. My favorite of the stories is ""Alert but Not Alarmed."" Here readers are asked to visualize a neighborhood where every backyard includes a huge ""intercontinental ballistic missile."" Placed there by the government, these missiles are at the ready to protect the neighborhoods from harm. As the years go by and the missiles remain unfired, people begin to develop their own unique ways to utilize each missile. Their protection changes from objects of deadly force and destruction to objects of art and usefulness.

9780060887322,"<b>Actual Rating: 3.5/5</b> The cover: I like this cover. It suits the story better than the new cover featuring the TV Show's actresses as the characters because they simply don't fit the descriptions of the girls in the story. Also, I think the best covers are the Australian ones, their covers for the series are simply beautiful *_* (except they don't have a cover for this particular book -the first one in the series-!). The storyline: Okay. I had the most fortunate and unfortunate luck to start watching the TV Show based on this series before starting the books. It was both good and bad. Good because I knew what to expect from the book and was thrilled to find more details and twists that are not available in the show. Bad because I was spoiled most of the book, I kind of knew what was going to happen. And also because the characters in the book aren't like the ones in the TV show. However, I'm reviewing the book objectively as if I haven't watched the show. So this is my honest review of the book separately. Summary: For those of you who have never watched the show or heard of it (like me less than 2 weeks ago...), here's a short spoiler free summary for you :). This book is about five best friends Alison, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer. They've been best friends for sometime now and it's the end of seventh grade. They're now having a sleepover at the night to celebrate the beginning of summer vacation, however, Ali disappears that night. The book starts by explaining what happened the day Ali disappears, but then picks up three years later with the girls getting ready for Junior year. They're no longer talking to each other and are living separate lives although they are still in the same small-town of Rosewood. It gives us a glimpse to what happened to each girl separately and how they've been dealing with Ali's disappearance. And throughout the story, we get to know more about each character's relationship with Ali and what secrets she had on them. How they've been living and what's up with them now. Then suddenly, Spencer, Emily, Hanna and Aria start receiving anonymous text messages about past secrets that only Ali knew about and new ones that no one knows about. At the end of the book, the girls try to bond back together. What I liked: - The storyline itself is very unique and compelling. - It is full of mystery, sadness, twists, scary moments, thriller, loss and heartbreak. - The girls' friendship is very unique. They had each other and all of a sudden it was taken away from them. We all could relate to that. - I loved the fact that each chapter is told about a different characters. It is mostly in this order: Emily, Spencer, Hanna then Aria. But it changes a bit at the end. - There's no specific narrator. The author tells you the story as she sees it. - It deals with real high school problems. - ""A""! I love ""A"" as crazy as it sounds!! <3. - It was a fast read. - The ending :'). What I disliked: - I didn't like the writing style that much. It was somewhat fast paced and everything was happening so quickly. But it might be just me because I'm not used to it. - There is a lot of swearing words. I don't think such sophisticated, young and somewhat wealthy and well raised girls should swear this much if not at all! - Not to mention, the girls smoke! It's just not right... I'm not against women smoking, but I think 16year olds shouldn't. (Again, a personal opinion.). The characters: Alison DiLaurentis (a.k.a Ali): She's somewhat the main character in this book. A very malicious, deadly and unfriendly girl who becomes friends with Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna. Only she's mostly toying with them, taken their secrets and then threating to expose them if they don't do what she says. She disappears in the summer of their seventh grade and doesn't show up. The girls thought they're safe because their secrets are gone. Guess what? They were wrong. Aria Montgomery: The hippy friend. She's been been always made fun of by Ali for her weird style of dressing. After Ali's disappearance, she stayed a year and a half in Iceland and came back later for her junior year of High School. She meets a very attractive guy and they fall in love instantly. Later on, turns out that this guy is her AP English teacher, Mr. Ezra Fitz. Throughout the book, Aria goes into a lot of trouble keeping an old secret and a new one, but unfortunately, A gets to her and start warning her. Aria is very nice, friendly and cute in her own way. She's one of my favorite characters in this book :). Emily Fields (a.k.a Em or Emy): The jock girl. A very nice, shy and good swimmer. She's the shiest in the group and tries to keep to herself. She tries so hard to hide the fact that she's gay from everyone thinking that they'll judge her and hate her. However, when she meets Maya, the new girl living in Ali's house, she starts to have very serious second thoughts about herself and her feelings. ""A"" obviously doesn't miss a chance to torture her and ruin her life. Hanna Marin (a.k.a Han): Han has serious problems and very bad morals (part of why I don't like her this much in these books so far - reading Flawless-). She used to be treated very badly by Alison, who used to call her Hefty Hanna, because she was fat and had grease everywhere in her body. When Ali disappeared, Hanna continued her commitment to try harder and be the next It Girl, which she achieved, using every thing she could do or get. Now the most popular girl in Rosewood Day, she faces other issues, including ""A"". She's now dating her longtime crush Sean Ackard who happens to be a member of the Virginity Club. Her father also comes back in her life and things are complicated again. ""A"", as always, being the ""nice"" person, intervenes only to make things even worse. Spencer Hastings (a.k.a Spence): The smartest in the group. Her family is very strict, serious and always the first in everything. She has a very nice and unique personality (she's my 2nd favorite character in this book :).) with loopholes as usual. She's always the one who stood up to Ali and was the last one who saw her before she went missing. Now, three years later, she's as determined and serious as ever, wanting to beat her older sister's, Melissa's, records. But, there's one thing she always wants despite her having everything; her sister's boyfriends. And so, she meets her sister's soon to be fiance Wren who's British, an intern to become a doctor, funny and cute. And the problems begin and get more complicated as ""A"" threatens to share her secrets, including those only her and Ali knew about. Other characters worth mentioning: Mona, Hanna's best friend since Ali's disappearance. She used to be harassed by Ali and her group (although Aria, Em, Han and Spence never said anything to help or stop Ali) for being a nerd and she tried so hard to be Ali's friend, but never succeeded, until Ali wen missing. Mike, Aria's younger brother. Darren Wilden, a cop who almost arrests Hanna. Ashley, Hanna's mother. Byron and Ella, Aria's parents. Favorite quotes: You wonder how someone so...well, so much like you went missing. You thought only girls who entered beauty pageants ended up on the sides of milk cartons. Well, think again. --- How it All Started. Aria headed into the classroom and fell into the first desk she saw. She put her head down and took heaving, emotional breaths. ""Hell is other people,"" she chanted. It was her favorite quote by the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre and a perfect mantra for Rosewood. --- Chapter 5: Starts and Fitz. Life's so much fun when you know everything. Just how do I know so much? You're probably dying to know, aren't you? Well, relax. All in due time. Believe me, I'd love to tell you. But what's the fun in that? I'll be watching. -A --- What Happens Next... Conclusion: Ouf. Finally! Well, I do favorite this book. It has been good, the series still has some potential, it could've been so much better. What do I have to say? Okay. If you've never watched the TV show, start this one first. You'll have an idea about the TV show and also you'll enjoy it much more since you won't be spoiled ;). If you've watched/you're watching the show, don't have high expectations! You might be really disappointed... First, you'll be spoiled, second, you'll feel like that there are unnecessarily details and most importantly, you'll probably dislike the characters (the best example for the last one is Hanna, in the TV show she's nice and thoughtful despite her being the It Girl, in the book, she's a complete bitch). From an objective point of view (regardless of my opinion on the TV Show): Give this book a chance. I didn't dislike it. I just think it could've been better :). If you're a fan of: mystery, thriller, murder, suspense, twists and at the same time a quick read then pick it up. You won't regret it :), because whether you like it or not, you'll have an opinion and an experience of your own :). Now time for me to finish Flawless ^_^.",Randa Kerbache
9780060887322,"I simply don't know what to say about this book. I'll be honest, it wasn't as great as I thought that it would be, even though I just had to finish it. For me, I had to try to imagine what it would be like in this rich, preppy, high clad, high class society in order for me understand some of it. I will be perfectly honest, I didn't even know some of the brands of things that the writer was talking about half the time. I did, however, enjoy that the writer took you through the lives of these four girls as they grew apart, I mean, you didn't go through 7th grade to 10th grade with each of them. You saw how their lives were in 7th grade before their friend, Ali, disappeared, and then you saw them three years later as their lives were coming back together again. Each chapter was about a different girl and what they were going through, it didn't jump around in one chapter, which I actually liked. As for how it turned out...I honestly didn't expect the ending. I also enjoy a book where you don't know what's going to happen. Or that you are thinking, ""well, this is how I think it's going to be"" and then at the end, it surprises you. I have to say, my heart felt bad for the character known as Spencer. She did something that was unforgettable, I wouldn't say unforgivable, and then to be treated the way she was by her parents just made me quite upset. As for my rating. I simply gave it 3 of 5 stars because I was expecting more and I didn't get it. I was a little disappointed in that. I love Sara Shepard as an author though. I'm currently reading her The Lying Game series now.",Erin Nation
9780060887322,"Okay, I have to admit that the first time I saw these books around the young adult fiction world; I wasn't planning on reading them. Do you want to know why? The covers! You should never judge a book by its cover, I know, but I just was really put off by the Barbie doll looking covers. When they first aired the trailer for the TV show, I was very intrigued and after the first episode, I was hooked! So I made it a goal to start the series as soon as possible this year. Now I can't wait to continue the series and can't wait for season 2 to air! ABC Family really did a great job at following the books. I mean, of course there is a lot of stuff that is in the books that aren't in the show, and vice versa, but the first book was amazing and the tv show is awesome! But now I'm going to try and stop talking about the TV show now and continue on with my review of the first book in the series, ha ha. Sara Shepard is a very good writer. I don't know how she has so many main characters without getting confused! I'm a writer myself and I normally only have one main character perspective in my novels, sometimes two. But never four! And all four have very different personalities! So kudos to her! Pretty Little Liars is also a very easy and short read. It's another one of those awesome books that you can get through very fast because the words flow so well together. I love the mix of drama and mystery. I know some people nearly consider them as part of the same genre, but not always. There can be a drama-mystery or just a plain mystery that just lurks on the mystery at hand and not a whole bunch of drama, if that makes sense at all. I can't wait to pick up the second book in the series, I am definitely ready to speed through it to and catch up with the books. I'm a bit worried, though, too. I don't want to read the book and have an idea of what might happen in the show. It's so complicated! Ha ha. Overall, this is a really good read. If you love the TV show, definitely pick the books up!",Amanda
9780060887322,"Alison, Emily, Spencer, Aria, and Hanna were once the best of friends back in the summer between seventh and eighth grade. They held private sleepovers, passed notes in homeroom, and shared their darkest secrets. Then a tragic incident shook the safe, suburban town of Rosewood: Alison vanished without a trace. Now years later, Alison still hasn't been found and the other girls are now in the eleventh grade, but are no longer friends. Emily is the sporty teen, obedient, and every parents' dream daughter. Aria is back from Iceland, more mysterious and prettier than ever. Chubby Hanna has lost the weight and has transformed herself into a sexy ""It Girl,"" while Spencer is a smart and preppy overachiever. Perfect lives, huh? Almost. When strange, threatening messages began appearing from a mysterious ""A"", the girls must face their past and the dark secrets they thought they had buried forever. PRETTY LITTLE LIARS is an eerie novel that gave me the chills with every chapter. Well-written and full of suspense, I'm sure it will attract many readers and also make a popular television show. With a cliffhanger ending, I definitely cannot wait for the sequel!",TeensReadToo
9781442435001,"4.5/5 Stars This book = wonderfulness, loveliness and awesomeness, the list goes on. I laughed, I smiled, I thrashed my arms in the air and waved around like a crazy person, and I cried, cried, cried (or shed tears, for the most part). It's just... *sighs*...amazing. The main character Emily's best friend Sloane disappeared at the beginning of the summer without telling her where she went and where she was going. This was utterly shocking to Emily because they did and have been doing everything together for a very long time. They also tell each other everything, as far as Emily knew. (Spoilers-ish up ahead.) About two weeks after her disappearance, Emily got this letter form her --- more specifically a list. It has a list of things Sloane wants Emily to do before the end of the summer. Since Emily have no other lead as to where Sloane could possibly be at, she decides to do her best to complete the list hoping that it'll eventually help her find Sloane. And it did, in the end. I was so glad she did, because I was starting to worry that she wouldn't. ( Since the book only had less than 50 pages left, and I was like: wait, how is Morgan Matson gonna pull that off? But she did. However, I wished Sloane could've appeared earlier or stayed longer... :( ) So, as the summer went by, Emily meets new people, like Frank Porter (as Sloane puts it, ""the most serious guy we've known,"" which Emily later found on out can be fun to be around, as well), Collins (the best friend of Frank, who, btw, is a super awesome guy and a great catch, despite what he and some others might think), and Dawn. All of it wouldn't have happened if it weren't for the list. I feel like I can personally relate to Emily because she's shy and doesn't usually feel comfortable to step out of her comfort zone. Although, like many others I think, wants to. And as the story went on, Sloane as well, especially when she revealed why she left without saying anything. I personally have moved a lot in the past, and like Sloane, leave and have lost friends each and every time. I mean, I still try and keep in contact with some of them (ones I have the phone numbers of anyways) but it just isn't really the same as being able to hang out and talk to them anytime. It's hard saying goodbye sometimes. I remember this theme, if it is a theme, from ??????C/??Amy & Roger??????C/??s Epic Detour,??????C/?? as well; Roger said he never says ??????C/??goodbye??????C/?? in a conversation, no matter what. Despite the fact that I was mad at Sloane for making Emily feel so terrible, and thinking why she would even think of doing something like this to her, I ended up really liking her in the end ??????C/?? mostly because I knew exactly where she was coming from. Plus, I also think she wanted Emily to have a great summer, even without her and that??????C/??s really nice and sweet of her ??????C/?? thinking about Emily and try and challenge her to do things outside of her comfort zone. Sloane is truly a fantastic best friend. (*Sighs* I wish I can have Sloane as a bestie. Wouldn??????C/??t that be nice?) Something I also disliked was the fact that Frank didn't tell Emily about what he had really wanted to say before she cut him off. Now thinking back on it, both Emily and Frank weren't really putting each other in the other person's position. It just really bothers me how they didn't even try to communicate and get things clear up when they both knew they had things to say to each other --- especially Frank. (Spoilers ends here.) I really, really liked and enjoyed reading ??????C/??Since You??????C/??ve Been Gone??????C/?? by Morgan Matson. It??????C/??s an absolutely fantastic read ??????C/?? especially for the summer.

9780330512855,"at first I was obessed with this book, i went crazy had to read them all, but then i was waiting for dark flame to come out and the flame inside of me sort of died down and i didnt like the series anymore. Its sort of like Justin Bieber, at first everyone was crazy about him and now its starting to die down. Then again some people are still crazy about him, so you might really like this book. I must say i think it was written for 10 yr olds but I wouldnt want my sister reading them. its the way it is written is for a young age group but the stuff that it is written about is more for 13 yr olds. hard to say. 2 and a half stars",Jemma
9780330512855,"I've noticed that most of the book I grabbed in a bookshop I found out later that it belongs in a series. I've read a few reviews of this book which only says how they hate or love it and nothing else. Some say that it's going to be another one of those good Twilight knock off books. This book I presumed is marketed for 16 year old girls who I am not. Seventeen year old Ever the sole survivor of a car crash that killed her parents, twelve year old sister and their dog. She then lives with her aunt in Southern California. Consumed by survivor guilt but also by a new ability to read thoughts of people around her. To tune the voices out she often crank up the volume of her iPOD and make herself disappear. Until Damen turns up the new strange and mysterious guy new in town. He convinces Ever to come out a be herself, Ever trying her best to avoid any contact and get close to anyone since the accident but how matter she avoids him she's lured back to him for the promise of silence and serenity. First few chapters I kind of felt bogged down then a while it soon took its own storyline. I like her sister's character, I think she puts the humour that's needed in the story. The main character has lots of issues going on (but won't specify to prevent me spoiling the whole book for whoever wants to read it) thus making her life much more complicated. Although I've noticed some inconsistencies in the book and too far fetched things that I felt was just thrown in there and did not give any explanation how it went about. Damen's true character wasn't show in depth and felt that they feel in love too soon without them spending enough time with each other. Problems with the ending where you felt that it's the end but yet it was not it kind of drag a bit until it lost it lost what it was supposed to have which is the suspense and satisfaction. I'm giving it another chance and decided to wait for book 2 and hope that there's something better in store for us readers.",R.D-Diaz

9780375835339,"Nick and Norah meet by chance in a club when Nick sees his ex girlfriend, Tris, walk in with her new boyfriend. Wanting to not look like the sad sap that is still hung up on her Nick asks Norah to be his 'girlfriend'. One kiss leads them into a night of adventure. I loved both Nick and Norah's characters however they weren't without their faults. Nick was very hung up on Tris throughout the book, which did get irritating and Norah seemed very fickle. It was their interaction with each other that I loved. They seemed to balance each other out. Norah appreciates his music and Nick appreciates her humour and you could see why these two would make a good couple. At the beginning of the book I really disliked Tris and although I can't say that I like her character there are points in the book where she behaves like a human being and I respect her for that. I really enjoyed the fact that this was not an instant love story. The amount of twists and turns and changing emotions made me feel like it was a little more realistic than love at first sight. Even at the end of the book when they both seem to have gotten over their demons there is still the niggling questioning thoughts in Norah's mind and I liked that. The realistic doubts of whether to take a chance on someone and getting hurt. It was nice to read a book that was not afraid to let the main character swear however at times the cussing felt quite excessive and I did question whether or not it was necessary. If you are looking to read a book that is fuelled on alcohol, stale oreos and sleep deprivation I would recommend Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist. However if you are offended by language I might give this one a miss.",Zara @ Page 394
9780375835339,"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist by David Levithan I was very excited to read this book and I must say it was a bit of a disappointment. I love both authors but this book just didn't do it for me. I would have liked this book much more if it weren't for all the cussing. The story is interesting but I had a hard time really getting into it and relating to the characters. . The characters were kind of annoying and could have been written better. I know for past books that both of these authors have done an excellent job in the past and could have done so much more. I just couldn't dig it for some reason. I don't think I'd read this book again. The cover is pretty cool, I like how it's a heart with headphones. I'd rate it a 2/5",Ashlea McDaid
9781405266109,"The Vile Village is the seventh book in A Series of Unfortunate Events by American author, Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler). As we once again join the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, they are sent by their banker, the ever-tussive Mr Poe, to the village of V.F.D under a government scheme based on the aphorism that it takes a whole village to raise a child. Having already suffered the loss of their parents, the threat of marriage, slave labour, hypnosis, a terrible boarding school, being thrown down a lift shaft and the murder of their Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine at the hands of the evil Count Olaf and his nefarious assistants, the siblings are ever-vigilant of his reappearance. Luckily these well-mannered and uncomplaining children are also very resourceful: Violet invents, Klaus researches and Sunny bites. Snicket???C/??s tone throughout is apologetic, sincere and matter-of-fact as he relates the unfortunate events in the children???C/??s lives; his imaginative and even surreptitiously educational style will hold much appeal for younger readers. Snicket???C/??s word and phrase definitions are often hilarious. This instalment sees the Baudelaires lodged with Hector the Handyman and forced to do chores for the village. But their time with Hector is actually quite good, as Violet works on improving Hector???C/??s self-sustaining hot air mobile home, while Klaus scours the library for loopholes in V.F.D. rules and Sunny bites fallen branches whilst waiting on clues of their friends, the Quagmire Triplets. But they soon fall foul of the many village rules : Detective Dupin throws them into jail and threatens them with burning at the stake. And just who is Jaques Snicket and what was the message about the Baudelaire parents he was prevented from giving them before his murder? Of course Count Olaf and his girlfriend, Esme Squalor are up to their usual tricks. As always, the alliterative titles are delightful and Brett Helquist provides some wonderfully evocative illustrations. What is in store for the orphans now? Doubtless the eighth installment, The Hostile Hospital will reveal all.",Marianne Vincent

Alyson Noel has captured her audience through events that have been thoroughly described so that the reader can create a vivid image in their minds. The two main characters, Ever and Damen, have been portrayed with such great personalities that the reader can tell that these two characters are meant to be together because they just fit so perfectly. However keeping with reality, Noel has also conveyed debate and disagreement between the characters like any other couple. Everlasting is crammed full of adventure, destiny, friendship and most importantly love. I believe that Noel has perfected this book by creating tension, mystery and indecisiveness amongst the characters. Following Ever and Damen through this series has been one of my best adventures, and I couldn't be happier with the ending. Alyson Noel is a true inspiration to everyone.",Maria
9780316231657,"My review: This book was already a movie by the time I began the series, which I have since seen and will talk about in a different post soon! I really liked this book, more than I expected to. For some reason, I went into it thinking it was going to be somewhat corny/sappy romance with the other elements to make it a truly well-rounded story. But there is a little bit of everything in this book... secrets, mystery, angst, magic, and more. There were two things that truly made a great foundation for this book, and really the whole series. One was that it is written to be a somewhat multi-generational story, weaving in and out of family histories. There is a lot of richness to be had in that kind of family saga. The other thing I liked was the gothic element that wove together the love between Lena and Ethan and the darkness that made up the paranormal elements of the story. The story is set in a quintessential southern town, still reliving the Civil War and making it a deep part of the town's culture. But, even with the occasional trips back in time, this could not be labeled historical fiction. Instead that history served as a backdrop for the story. Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --The character of Lena. I loved that she wasn't created to be the epitome of teenage perfection. She struggled deeply with darkness and that made her so much more believable and likable. --The alternate world. I loved how the authors created a world for the Casters and laid it on top of our own. The existence of the Caster Library is an example of this. A magical library with a librarian that exists below the regular library. The mythology of magic was thoroughly blended with that of the mundane. --The ending. It left a fabulous opening for the next book. --The POV. It was told from the POV of Ethan, instead of the usual female lead. This was refreshing! Things I wanted more of... --The mythology of the Caster world. I am hoping that this is explored is explored more full in subsequent books. My recommendation: If you like paranormal YA, I would suggest this. I liked the characters a whole lot more than those of certain vampire fiction. There is darkness and angst, but it doesn't overload the teenage emo attitude. I will definitely be reading the next book",Kim

The story starts off with the girls discovering what they believe to be the dead body of Ian Thomas, the accused killer of their childhood friend, Alison DiLaurentis. The girls hear a snap in the woods and quickly go for help. But by the time the cops show up to investigate, there is no evidence of a body. Nothing remains in the space where Ian was moments ago. From this point on, the rest of the story is downhill for Spencer, Hanna, Aria, and Emily. Soon, the girls are branded as liars and can no longer go to the cops for help. Besides, Detective Wilden is acting suspicious. The girls uncover a connection between the detective, Alison's brother, Jason, and Ian Thomas from high school. How deep is the connection, and could there be a cover-up of some kind? Throughout all of the murder drama and hunt for Ali's killer, the girls struggle to move on with their lives. But just as with the police, there are complications. Spencer is positive she's adopted and is determined to find her birth mother. Only, once again, Spencer is taken advantage of. Emily has a new boyfriend, but his mother obviously hates her. Hanna is in a battle of wits with her step-sister, Kate. They are fighting over Aria's younger brother, Mike, and Hanna is determined to win his heart. And a chance encounter with Jason DiLaurentis rekindles the crush Aria had on him when she was younger. KILLER is one of those books that is setting up the reader for what is to come in future installments. There is a lot of stuff going on throughout the book, yet it seems that none of it gets resolved by the time the reader gets to the final page. It will keep the reader anxious for the next chapter and frustrated that the next book is not available yet. The final note from the ever mysterious ""A"" at the end of the novel sums the book up nicely... ""The questions are probably killing you..."" and ""It's enough to make anyone crazy.""

9780141339726,"Chris Bradford has the knack of keeping you hooked. And ""The Ring of Sky"", the 8th book in the ""Young Samurai"" series and Jack Fletchers final push to escape the Shogun's samurai and get home to England is no different. With the plot twisting and turning like a treacherous mountain road, you never know what awaits you behind the next bend: danger, heartache, joy or moments of pure hilarity, a new friend or a familiar foe. The characters are likeable and feel authentic, because they all have their flaws to contend with and their own inner demons to battle. New characters feel like old friends after about three pages and familiar ones, that keep popping up throughout the series when you least expect them to, seem like you've known them for many years and it's not always easy to say goodbye. What I like most about the series though is that it is not merely an action-packed adventure-story with nail-biting tension, but that it manages to be highly instructive at the same time, in a refreshingly offhand sort of way. Through Jack the reader gains an amazing amount of insight not only into Japanese culture and society at that time and of course into the field of martial arts, but also learns some important lessons of life: about determination, loyalty, friendship, kindness and personal strength. So when you have followed Jack through all the highs and lows of his journey and his ultimate effort to reach home, you will have inadvertently absorbed some of that wisdom for yourself and have grown a little bit as a person, whether you are 9 or 90 years of age. I know I did and so did my girls, and that's exactly what will make ""Young Samurai"" always very special to us.

9781849051453,"My 8 year old autistic son recently told me that this was his favourite book. He really identifies with the characters and we are able to relate the situations to things that happen to him at school. It validates the way that he feels and then offers him insight on how other people may feel in that situation. The stories offer a solution and a happy ending. Although my son is verbal, he doesn't talk about school or how he feels. It is really exciting to be able to read something and then have him acknowledge that he sometimes feels that way too. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help talking with their child about appropriate behaviour, particularly when dealing with other children.",Suzanne Ireland
9781416989424,"Hush, Hush is the first book I read that's about Fallen Angels. At first, I though it would be ridiculous to read about fallen angels, but it proved me wrong. It was a fantastic read that was filled with mystery, thrillers, and love. The story revolves around Nora Grey. Patch, the new student, ends up being Norah's biology lab partner. She finds out that Patch is a very mysterious and cocky guy, but she's sure that there is more to him than she thinks. Nora might be described as stupid, but I find her clever. To actually think of the possibility of fallen angels is crazy. She was clever enough to know that something doesn't add up when it comes to Patch and the definition of normal. Norah's sensing of danger is spot on, she even felt something wrong when she met the two new guys at a caf??????Â©ï¸ shop with Vee, one of them being a new transfer student. I thought she would be na??????-ve at first, but she didn't. Her best friend Vee is the one who is careless and na??????-ve. Vee just wants to have fun all the time and gets herself into situations that can actually cause danger to her. However I enjoyed Vee's company, she is supportive of Norah and always looks out for her. Patch is a guy who seems very dangerous; at least he looks the part. He always wears black, and no one knows anything about his background or history. Patch is described as a hot guy, and his cocky comments to Norah never appease to amuse me. I adored Patch and loved his mysterious aura throughout the book. I really enjoyed Becca's writing style. Especially when it comes to internal character conversations. It was full of entertainment, swoon worthy moments, and action scenes all packed into one book. I recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet, and anyone who loves reading a book about fallen angels. Maji Bookshelf http://majibookshelf.blogspot.com/",Juhina & Farah

Oh jeesh, Patch. If I had to describe him using only one word, that word would be 'Yum'. He was dark, mysterious, dangerous, wild, and sexy. He was everything I'd want my fallen angel to be.

Nora is forced to seat with the creepy and obnoxious transfer Patch who incidentally knows how to get under her skin and somehow he knows things about her. Unfortunately, she's eerily attracted to him. As the routine continues, he antagonizes her and makes her flip off her normal self. While driving back home a guy with superhuman strength, wearing a ski mask attacks her after running and getting hit by the car causing severe damage to the car but when the damage disappears and the memory stars diminishing she starts to question her sanity. Nora then seeks to use Eliot a new student who always hangs out with his friend Jules outside of school to distract her of her attraction to Patch at no avail. Patch keeps affecting her and she couldn't control it. Then another occurrence sends her rechecking her sanity again. Soon she stumbles upon a shocking and unsettling news on Eliots past and discovers that the same guy that attacked her the other night had attacked her bestfriend Vee confirming the sanctity of the incident. They decide to investigate their two suspects; Patch and Eliot. Nora is almost certain that Eliot is the guy when other occurrences point towards him but Vee is not so sure. Although Nora doesn't believe Patch was the attacker she was convinced that he has something to do with all that's happened since she met him but he never gave anything but vague answers. Then another incident brings the police to her house but before she could process that, she is thrown over by the possibility that Patch may be a Fallen Angel. After facing an assault from Elliot, she is determined to spy on him at his old school. To her horror she finds herself at a crime scene with the traces of the incident disappearing and the presence of the ski masked guy creeping up her spine. Patch arrived shortly after her panicked call and they were forced to put up at a motel when the weather turned harsh. The night quickly turned to be the night Nora unintentionally discovers Patch secrets and his relationship with her new school psychologist Green and according to Green whose real name is Dabria, he's to kill her and she is his means to regrow his wings and gain passage back home to become a Guardian Angel, a rank he's not contempt with; he wants to become a human. When he gets angered that she unwittingly found out about his secret she is certain that he's going to kill her but her attempts to escape him fails. After another somewhat vague conversation, Patch set off alone to ""take care"" of Dabria while Nora is almost killed by Dabria after she drops her an info about Patchs intention on sacrificing her, a Nephil descendant.. Torn between logical reasoning and her undeniable feelings and trust for him she tries to escape him but he catches up on her trail. She received a blackmail call from Eliot threatening to kill Vee only to discover that the attacker had been Jules and he seeks revenge on Patch using his love for Nora; he had been using Eliot as a spy. She barely escapes Jules to find Vee but he finds her, trapping her alone in the darkened school. She gets to witness the depth of Patchs love for her when he sacrifices his human vessel to save her and she decides to sacrifice herself to give him his wish of becoming human, that will kill Jules in the process but Patch saves her instead refusing. Saving Nora turnes him into her Guardian Angel. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* Patchs dark and deep personality is compelling but I found myself struggling to warm around Nora; felt like she had two different personalities. That said, I appreciated her being untrusting of Patch despite her feelings for him. There are quite a number of holes in the plotline; many unanswered questions after certain scenes. What was impressive was the way the author describes the sceneries. I felt the author could touch more on the emotional side of both and could have revealed more on Patchs point of view to let the readers in on the progress of his desire to kill her turning to love. The lack of the above made it a tad lacking in the romance department. It could have been made more intense rather it felt more of a mystery thriller. Other than that, more on Eliot and Jules could have deepened that plotline and I found the relationship between Nora and her best friends Vee without depth. In whole I felt the plot could have been better executed.",Shayla
9781416989424,"Her best friend Vee thinks she should loosen up a bit. Easier said than done. Nora Grey has no interest in boys, that is, until their teacher comes up with a new seating arrangement. Patch Cipriano is the new student she has never really noticed before, but now finds herself eerily drawn to. Her gut feeling tells Nora to stay the hell away from him one second, just to do a complete one-eighty the next. When someone starts stalking her, there's no doubt in her mind it's Patch's doing. He always shows up when least expected and pins her with dark and smoldering looks. Most certainly not a good idea to fall for him! One by one Nora comes closer to discovering the truth - the truth about Patch, and about her role in a war between supernatural beings. Will putting her trust in Patch be Nora's downfall? I've heard so much about the Hush, Hush series and finally succumbed to my itch to buy the first book. Reading various reviews I got the feeling I'd either love or hate it. Well, let's just say I landed smack dab in the middle on the ""or"". As I've said countless times in the past I'm a fan of prologues. Hush, Hush happens to have a very interesting one. Unfortunately, in the end it felt like there wasn't much connecting it to the plot. It was probably designed to start off the world building with a bang. Didn't cut it for me, though. I prefer books that work as a stand alone even though they're part of a series. What I loved was the absence of vampires. Don't get me wrong, I'm addicted to paranormal romance with a vampire as the main character. It's just that I'm particularly interested in angel-themed reads these days. The idea of a war between immortals and the fallen is good, but the execution turned out to be only so-so. Despite his general demeanor being a bit off-putting at times I liked Patch well enough. What's wrong with a dude who's a little twisted?! Me likey! I was waiting for Nora to take his pushy self down a notch. Sadly, it never came to that. While Patch intrigued me I couldn't make myself care for Nora. She sent out mixed signals all page long. I want him! He's dangerous! I'm falling for him! He wants to kill me! Intended, no doubt, was for it to come across as an inner battle she needed to fight. The outcome for me were two or three deliberate eyerolls aimed at her flakiness. Then again, I understood how frustrating it was for her to crush on someone with such a dark side to him. It bugged her to no end. The confusion about what was real and what just her imagination playing tricks on her gave the story an interesting edge - even scary at times. Nora slowly grew on me. In the beginning I suspected Patch didn't really know what he wanted. His mood swings made me dizzy. Turned out I wasn't too far off with my assumption. A conflicted hero with a touch of tortured. Yay! On top of this I'd kill to have his ability for just one day. Which one you want to know? Uhuhu, sorry, I'm not saying. On the bright side I definitely felt the chemistry, however weird, between the two protagonists and secretly kept my fingers crossed in hope that Patch didn't reveal himself to be the bad guy. One specific moment (Nora on the counter - Patch standing between her legs) had me fluttering my lashes wildly. The villain (it might or might not have been Patch) creeped me out big time. Well done, Fitzpatrick! On to another character: Vee Sky, Nora's best friend, had a very complex personality. I'm sure you'll like this brash girl. She's full of energy and a much needed ray of sunshine in Nora's life. Yes, she talked a lot of smack, but also acted first and asked questions later when it counted. Believe me, the **** hit the fan! There was a lot of constant tension because of the unknown evil surrounding Nora. Always a plus, too, the story wasn't lacking suspense. True, it did start out slow, but eventually gained speed. Whether you'll like this book or not has a lot to do with the expectations you have going in. It's a quick, light read. I enjoyed it, but have read better. Neither can I criticize much, nor give a lot of praise. I will read Crescendo (Hush, Hush #2), for I was entertained enough to want to know what's going to happen to Patch and Nora. It would've been a good idea to buy both and read them in one go. 3 stars for Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick. Beware of Spoilers!

9781416989424,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) The first few pages of Hush, Hush pulled me in. I was hooked to the story before the first chapter even started. I had a little trouble getting through this book, but that's not because of the book, I just didn't have much time to read and I didn't like only being able to read a few pages at a time. Nora was a good character, but she wasn't a favorite. I liked reading about her and Patch, even though Patch was kind of creepy at first. (Sorry to those of you who are in love with Patch!) I mean, I do love Patch, but not very much in the beginning. He's still a bit creepy to me, but towards the end of the book I started liking him. Nora and Patch's relationship is weird. I can't really explain that, it's just so different, if that makes sense. Which different is good. Unique. And gosh, do I looove me some YA angels! Patch is cocky and doesn't care about anything it seems, and Nora stands up for herself (Which I really liked, it's unlike a lot of the main girl characters in YA.) I loved Nora and Vee's friendship, they really show the meaning of best friends. Though Vee, alone, really got on my nerves at times. You'll just have to read it and see what I mean. Overall, this book is really unique, I'm not going to go into too many details because I don't want to give any spoilers away. But Fitzpatrick's writing is really good, can't wait to read the next installment. I'll definitely be trying to get my hands on that soon. =)",Amanda
9781416989424,"Nora Grey isn't your typical high school student in the sense that she spends a lot of time on her own and yet concentrates on her studies and has her head on straight. She is that good girl that doesn't want any trouble and, slightly reminding me of Rory from my beloved Gilmore Girls in the ""has her sights set on Yale and nothing will stand in her way"" attitude (and yes, I know Rory was Harvard-bound, but you get where I'm going). But trouble seems to find her in the form of that mysteriously gorgeous bad boy, Patch. And Patch...how can I describe Patch without turning into a puddle of mush? Well, he's trouble, plain and simple. But he's that good kind of trouble that just about anyone with the XX chromosome is attracted to. He's got the sarcasm down to an art and there's also the fact there's something about him that's not quite right. Becca Fitzpatrick has done a beautiful job with not only the characters in HUSH, HUSH, but also the imagery is phenomenal. There are moments when she describes the scenery and it feels as if you are walking through places they frequented. And yet even in what should be the most innocent of events, there seemed to be this undertone that something dangerous was near. And one thing that makes me over the moon is the fact that every character serves a purpose. There's not all these extra characters thrown in there along the way, with no explanation of why. I like that. The only thing about the entire story that got me was Vee, but just a little. I found Vee to be one of those friends that you have to take care of and keep an eye on like you do a child. A bit reckless and self-absorbed, but she still plays her role. There were times when I found myself literally laughing out loud, like for this particular gem: ""I scribbled Jerk on the first line. On the line beneath it I added, Smokes cigars, Will die of lung cancer. Hopefully soon. Excellent physical shape."" The above was from Nora, shortly after her first couple of encounters with Patch. Despite the many humorous gems I found throughout the entire book, this is also a dark novel, and in saying that, there are moments when I would gasp in shock or surprise. It seemed that over the course of 400 pages, I went through every emotion possible, and that's a good thing! Few authors can create a world and a cast of characters that sticks in your head like these do. Of course, there are already a few different comparisons going on throughout the blogosphere. One being the comparison between HUSH, HUSH and TWILIGHT. Now, of course there are similarities, but they are far from the same novel, or even in the same ballpark for that matter, and the majority of similarities (bad boy/good girl, bad boy has some sort of ""different"" attribute, fall in love) are similar in books with just about any form of romance over the last couple hundred years. Then there are those (the Biology room as a beginning) that are clearly similar, but they don't make the stories the same. Then there's the comparison of Edward from said TWILIGHT and Patch. And there's also this comparison of Spike and Angel from Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and later Angel) and Patch. As someone who was never a fan of either of these shows, I can't comment on that side of the argument because I have no insight on either of those characters. But I can comment on the Edward comparison; and boy, let me tell you, Edward ain't got nothing on Patch! The only thing that Edward has over Patch is those sparkles, but Patch has scars, and scars beat sparkles hands down! HUSH, HUSH seemed to captivate me in a way that no other book has since...I don't quite remember. I haven't stayed up until 2am reading anything in a long while, much less a 400 page book in one sitting! And if my review can't convince you to read this awesomeness, then just look at the cover! It's haunting, beautiful, memorable, and drop dead sexy...just like the story within. This is the hardest review I've written and I mean that in a good way. HUSH, HUSH is a title that for the most part receives automatic squeals and excitement simply from its name alone, and there is a reason for all of this commotion. That reason, in short, is because it is fantastically amazing! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781442421776,"Wow. I was absolutely blown away with this book. This paranormal romance was the perfect blend of suspense and wit. When I wasn't completely freaked out, I was laughing hysterically. The dialogue was killer! Hello, chemistry! Mara and Noah have such a witty but cute relationship. And Noah combines sweet, sexy, and adorable all in the best way possible. As for the ""horror"" part of the book, the hallucinations that Mara has are what I call: trippy. Half of the time, I didn't know what was real and what was just a figment of her imagination. At some point, it was actually very confusing. That was really the only downside to the book. I think, though, that it was meant to be that way. Overall, this is definitely one of my top favorite book series. This is one of those books that you stay up until 2A.M. to finish and then die a little waiting for the next book. I'm super excited to read the next one in the series, and I'm counting down the days for /The Retribution of Mara Dyer/.",Bryce

9780785120124,"Just finished reading Planet Hulk and I have to say - it has been a very fun and enjoyable read! The premise (for those who've not read it) is that the Hulk is betrayed by earth's superheros and blasted off to space, with the purpose of landing on a planet where no one can bother him. But all does no go according to plan. Hulk crash lands on the 'wrong' planet - Sakaar -' ruled by the tyranical Red King. Hulk is enslaved and forced to fight as a gladiator. He forges a bond of brotherhood with his fellow fighters; Korg - a wise rock man, Miek - a crafty insectoid, Hiroim - a shadow warrior and Elloe - a noble born rebel and Brood - an Alien-esque insectoid. Together they start a revolution to overthrow the Red King. Being a big fan of sci-fi and Star Wars, I immediatly started lapping up this awesome comic from the off! The writer Greg Pak had created a rich world full of colour, culture and history. Its a cross between Tatooine and Ancient Rome! Greg Pak had left nothing out, he delves into each cultures belief systems and how most of them see Hulk as their saviour, their prophecised 'Green Skaar' or 'Holku'. The artwork by Carlo Pagulayan and Aaron Lopresti is hugely impressive. The Hulk has never looked more lethal and beautiful (in a weird way!). And the inhabitants of Sakaar look stunning, as does the flora and fauna. I love the whole premise - from slave to gladiator, saviour to king - aspect of the storyline for Hulk. For once - in this alien world, you could say that the Hulk is at home. There are twists and turns aplenty in this graphic novel. One of the most coolest part of the story is the cameo by the Silver Surfer! It may be brief but his appearance contributes to the storyline in a big way. I love the fight between him and Hulk, the fight made more shocking because of their friendship. There are so many characters, so many plot points in this comic, that its easy to get lost! Its best to read it either A) slow, or B) a second time - I myself will go for the latter! The story is so action packed and un-put-downable you just want to carry on and see whats around the corner. It is smashing fun! Another thing I love about this package is the Gladiators guidebook at the end, where we have a good few pages with information on Sakaar; maps, details of its wildlife, plant life, culture, society, customs and beliefs as well as geography and map of Sakaar. Its a welcome addition and makes for a nice read! All in all, Planet Hulk is an awesome graphic novel. Its not perfect, there are flaws yes, but I think those can be overlooked because the enjoyment factor far outweighs anything else! I'm glad to have purchased it and its made a welcome addition to my comic book collection. Highly recommended!",Mahbub Ahmed
9780141328546,"And I thought I'd had enough of vampires. After many beloved and some stereotypical YA vampire books in the past years I felt fine with putting that category on the waiting list for a while. Until I decided to pick up the first book in this series and Richelle Mead's VAMPIRE ACADEMY restored my faith in good and imaginative vampire worlds. I'd had my eyes on the VAMPIRE ACADEMY books for quite a while, many people kept recommending them and I can remember the rave about the last book in the series. Now with the first movie coming out in 2014 I couldn't hold out on this series any longer. Richelle's series isn't your average -There's a vampire in this story and he's gonna bite you, so you become one, too- story. In the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series you don't encounter ordinary vampires. There are different types of blood-suckers, like different links to an evolutionary chain. Our two heroines Rose and Lissa cover the two categories of Moroi and Dhampirs. Moroi are vampires who have the power to wield magic. Dhampirs are a crossing between Moroi and humans and their task is to protect royal Moroi. At the St. Vladimir's Academy they are receiving a special training for the purpose of becoming body guards when they are finished. Those two kinds are co-existing and depending on the other, never purposefully harming humans. The Strigoi make up the third and an entirely different category. They are soulless creatures only existing to destory and hurt humans, Moroi and Dhampirs alike. Strigoi are effortless killers, but they can also be cruel enough to turn the other vampires into one of them and doom them to become evil and heartless, too. They make for evil and seemingly unstoppable enemies in all six books of this series. The fight between Moroi, Dhampirs and Strigoi is the main focus of the VAMPIRE ACADEMY series. Of course you can expect political, social and personal conflicts as well. Now the St. Vladimir's Academy is home to many Moroi and Dhampirs and is the central setting for the six books in this series. Housing, training and study rooms assembled like a small campus, the academic feel is definitely there. But with all the unexpected attacks and complications appearing on the scene it's no wonder Rose and her friends are forced to leave their textbooks behind and step into battle. The characters are travelling a lot, too. Really enjoyed seeing many new places together with Rose and her friends. All six books read on a book binge equal a huge vamptastic adventure beyond imagination. So much action and fights! However the series has its quiet moments, too. The greatest personal focus lies on the bond Rose and Lissa share as best friends and their spiritual bond that's pretty special for Moroi standards. Rose can feel what Lissa's feeling and in certain moments even see through Lissa's eyes. At first this was a very fun aspect about their friendship. The more often Rose visited Lissa's body though, story lows occurred. Sometimes I just felt like skipping these scenes altogether. Rose is the breakaway, tough and sexy warrior. Lissa her well-guarded, spiritual, emphatic protege. They are body and mind, friends who rule the hearts of many readers. They are lucky to have been gifted with two equally appealling love stories, slightly erotic, romantic and steamy for sure. Lissa finds Christian, an outsider, who was not even looking for acceptance until he met Lissa. They are healing each other from the wounds of their pasts and click together like a puzzle meant to exist. And Rose gets her love story with Dimitri. Just like everyone told me, that guy is sexy! Their difference in age and experience puts a forbidden touch to their love story. He is her instructor and she is supposed to keep her hands off him. Is that a dare? Major turn-on! FROSTBITE, the second novel, is one of my favourie parts in the series, sending our friends on a trip to winter wonderland where they stay at a dreamy lodge. And this instalment offers the chance to make new friends and meet another boy who will play an important role in Rose's life, Adrian. The books keep getting longer and longer. Currently LAST SACRIFICE is the longest book I've read so far this year. Not just in page count a?? 2688 pages- is this series truly epic, but in its emotional variety, youthful voices, and imaginative, adventurous story line. 5/5 ***** VAMPIRE ACADEMY Series- One of the most enthralling and memorable YA vampire worlds I've had the pleasure to live in. A series I wish I would have encountered much sooner. I'm so glad that all six books were released already and I could pick up the next book right after one was finished. I wouldn't have wanted to wait one year for each of them to come out. The first three BLOODLINES books are waiting on my Kindle to be read. The decision whether to start the series now or wait till all of them have been released has yet to be made.",MissPageTurner

The kids are running out of food, gaining powers, and a Darkness is calling to some of the members of The FAYZ. I enjoyed this story so much that after I read it I promptly ordered the first book. I am eagerly awaiting its arrival so that I can see how this all started. I thought the story flowed very well, was well-written, and the characters pulled me in from beginning to end. I literally had trouble putting the book down once I started reading. HUNGER can stand alone, but you'll probably want to read the first title in the series, like me, either before or after finishing this one.",TeensReadToo
9780141326085,"It took me a while to start this book. And then it took me a while to read it through. Yes, it's a good read, but the overall writing wasn't as captivating as I expected. It's kind of slow paced, and occasionally just not that fluent. There's the whole thing with the Civil War. Yes, it's somewhat important part of the characters' history, but all the historical reenactments and history lessons just didn't do it for me. Same with the DAR and PTA. Witch hunt also included, but that was a big part of the plot, so that I could have lived with. Parts about the Civil War could have been completely removed, and I probably wouldn't have noticed a difference. They only distracted me, and I wished those parts were replaced with Ethan's and Lena's romance. Since there could have been so much more details about that, then I would've been happy. Overall, I liked Ethan and Lena. A couple, who are destined to be together, though the fate is against them. Especially when we find out the thing about Mortals and Casters not working so well together. Ethan is a narrator, which was interesting considering women authors. Despite that, Ethan was a believable character. He's blind to Lena's flaws, but isn't that how it always is when you're madly in love with someone. They're the perfection and you would do anything for them. So Ethan's quite the knight in shiny armor through out the book. And Lena. She seems so nice. So, so nice. She would never even hurt a fly, except when she loses the control of her powers. But then again, when she gains the control, her niceness starts cracking. The thing with the book and sort of brainwashing her aunt and cousin? Not nice! So even though I liked her and Ethan together, I liked Ethan more. There's a bunch of other people hanging around, but only few I really liked, being Uncle Macon, Link and Ridley. Believe it or not, I really liked her! Especially the thing with ""Sympathy for the devil""- song, that was quite funny. Luckily, there's more of her in the second book! Overall, a good read. The ending saved the whole book, before that I had some troubles following the story, but the end was loud and clear. I cried like a baby. Like I always do, when there's a good story going on. This was the reason I started book 2 right away!",Monaliz @ Mind Reading?
9780141326085,"A lot of people have recommended this read to me so I just had to pick it up. For the most part it was a good read for me. A boy growing up in a town that he wants to get away from and a new, completely unusual girl comes into the picture that interests him because she's so different to what he's used to. It's the basis of a story that can go anywhere. It had a lot of exciting and shocking events within the story that made me feel for the main characters but the problem was it went on too long. It's fine for a book to be over 500 pages, but when it gets repetitive it's hard to finish for the storyline and not for the sake of finishing it because I had already read 400 pages. The characters themselves were great. Lena was a strong character that didn't take no for an answer and Ethan was sweet. The supporting characters were good too. Link (Ethan's best friend) was funny and seemed to be the opposite to Ethan which was probably why they fit so well. The characters that are there to sort of test the protagonists - which they did in bucket loads - were written really well. Beautiful Creatures is all about this curse that Lena has. It's all about counting down to Lena's sixteenth birthday when something disastrous is going to happen. The build up to the birthday is full of suspense which is definitely what kept me reading. Which brings me to another problem I had. The timing of this book was brilliant until it got closer to the birthday. It just seemed like as it got closer to the date in the book the time gap between events got shorter and shorter which put me off a little. It wasn't evenly distributed if that makes sense. Something would happen and then readers are reminded the date is three months away, but then something else would happen and then reader's are reminded that the birth day is the next week. It was a little frustrating. The setting of the story - a small town called Gatlin - was brilliantly written. It was a place that was meant to be suffocating and stuffy. It was meant to put people off, at least people who had any sense according to Ethan. I think it was the perfect place for a story like Beautiful Creatures to take place. Gatlin was probably my most favourite aspect of the novel. Overall, I did enjoy this read because it has a little of everything. I do recommend it for those who like novels filled with suspense, nasty schoolgirls and sweet romance that develops in its own time.",Maryam H

9780141326085,"I like the humor in the story lines. Chapter one, and the book had me giggling on my lunch break with everybody giving me looks in the staff room. I think that earned the storytelling quality a 4 out of 5. The story itself even if it is not terribly original is quite captivating. The authors have seamlessly blended modern day teen culture with paranormal fantasy that as a reader I could believe in. If I have to grade the ""suspension of disbelief"" for this story I will have to give it a 4.5 out of 5. The ending however is a cliffhanger. Although the ending did close the book nicely, it is also the beginning of the next book. Gave the impression that the whole book is just chapter one of a bigger book. That earned a 2 out of 5. The cover art? It could do better. I have seen this book for sometime now in the blogosphere but ignored it for a few months just because I do not find the cover attractive to my fantasy reader's eyes. The art department who did this cover needs to be fired. In a marketing graph, this cover art would be a 1 out of 5. Overall, this book is a 3.5 out of 5.",Cherry
9780141326085,"Firstly, I have to say I had a slight giggle to myself about the green eyes and black hair (I should really start a list to see how many paranormal protagonists we can find with green eyes and/or black hair). The first person narrative is written from the perspective of the male protagonist (Ethan) something I did find hard to relate to being a girl and having three girls myself (J has to get in touch with his feminine side in our house or shut the door to watch sport). There is dramatic tension almost from the first page. The background descriptions of the characters and the setting were fantastic and really fed my technicolor imagination. The use of the Gothic convention of nesting (a story within a story) was deployed with great efficiency adding significance to the main plot. There is clever use of the history of the civil war intertwining the story, although I can appreciate the detail and depth it added to the story it is probably easier to relate to if you are American and studied the Civil War. The references to To Kill a Mockingbird were intriguing and have certainly inspired me to read it. I found the description of Ethan's aunts an ingenious parallel to the mythical fates or even the witches in Macbeth. The references to religion and voodoo were extraordinary and well written, the cross-over element between religions was enlightening. Although, I found the classification of all paranormal/supernatural beings as Casters was too much of a generalisation for me, I appreciate that all things contain good and bad elements, the yin and yang if you will, but I like my neat little categories Vampire, Witch, Shifter, etc but that is just a personal preference. The Gothic imagery was fantastic, I especially liked the description of the libraries (I wonder why!). The use of Latin and Welsh (yeah! WELSH) was just fantastic (not that I am biased because I am Welsh). The action is tightly packed towards the end of the book and the ending is a cliff-hanger. However, there were some elements that bothered me, I found the relationship between Ethan and Lena to be very intense considering their ages (15 & 16) perhaps it is just he mother coming out in me as I do not think I would be very happy if one of my daughters was in such an intense relationship at that age. I guess the point is that soul mates/reincarnation has no age limits. I also found Amma's changing attitude to Lena to be a bit confusing. On the whole an enjoyable paranormal romance/thriller with some terrific quotes.",Emma Davies
9780141326085,"I haven't seen a bad review about this book yet so my expectations of this book were exceedingly high... and I think that ruined it a bit for me. Don't get me wrong, I still thoroughly enjoyed this masterfully written tale, but just not as much as I thought I would. First of all, I loved Ethan. I thought he was extremely sweet and honest protagonist. He wasn't pretending to be a saint, but nor did he do anything bad. Lena on the other hand... I just couldn't bring myself to like her. I tried very hard, but I just couldn't feel a connection with her, and I couldn't see why Ethan liked her so much. Link was another character I adored. How he can manage to be so laid back and funny with a mother like his I'll never know. And he really was funny; I would have loved for there to be more of him in the book; with quotes like: ""Shut up. You're so whipped I should buy you a saddle."" I found the plot to be unique and the writing engaging. I loved the To Kill A Mockingbird (by Harper Lee) references and found the similarities between Gatlin and Maycomb astounding. Beautiful Creatures is almost a modern-day fantasy version of TKAM. Having said all of that, I will definitely re-read this book and I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel! Overall, I'm giving this book 4 and a 1/2 stars out of 5. It misses out on that half a star for me just because I could connect with Lena, but that doesn't mean anyone else will have the same problem. Therefore, I recommend this book to everyone who loves fantasy, To Kill A Mockingbird and YA literature in general.",Amy Mansell
9780552563154,"Anyone who really knows me know that I have an extremely soft spot for Sir Terry Pratchett (I've met him several times and have more than a few autographed Discworld books) and it goes without saying that if it wrote it I'm going to totally love it, and this book is no exception! The book revolves around a very Dickensian London and is the tale of a young man by the name of Dodger. No, this Dodger isn't the infamous Dicken's Dodger this Dodger is a very different kettle of fish altogether. This Dodger is what is known as a tosher, a sewer scavenger who eeks out some kind of living from things he finds in the sewers, things that people have lost like coins, gems and the like. He has no family to speak of but does have a series of acquaintances that you get to meet during the course of the book and some of them are pretty interesting. Dodger is a total nobody until the day he steps in to save the life of a stranger under attack by thugs. Little does Dodger realise what a fateful decision he has made by stepping forward and saving the young girls life. Life rapidly alters for Dodger when he decides that he can do a better job of protecting his young lady than the adults can and he finds himself in the midst of an adventure, in the company of some rather infamous people..... reporter Charlie Dickens, Benjamin Disraeli and Sweeney Todd among many more. This is a wonderful book and is Sir Terry at his best. The story twists and turn in so many unexpected ways as you explore a London of the past with Dodger. The world is beautifully written as you would expect and the humour is obvious through-out and is firmly tongue-in-cheek as you would expect. Dodger is a fantastic character and so very likeable despite the fact that he is a very naughty young man indeed, the proverbial cheeky chappy! Dodger's relationships with all the various characters throughout the book are wonderful, some are sweet, some are a little more tense but some are just genius, such as Charlie Dickens, who is a touch of class and brilliant character introduction. This may be classed as a children's book but as an adult reading I can say that you wouldn't necessarily realise that fact if you didn't know it. Terry Pratchett had again written a book for younger viewers that is just as good for adult and as I said if you didn't know you wouldn't know the difference and I think that is one of the many things that Sir Terry is so talented at doing. I am a HUGE fan of the Discworld novels but once in a while it's very refreshing to read a story that isn't based there, as in this case. It may not be classic Discworld but this book is still a treat for the senses and I would highly recommend it to young and old!",Thea Wilson
9781416903574,"Three troubled teens cross paths at Aspen Springs, a psychiatric hospital, after attempting suicide. Connor, Tony, and Vanessa all have demons that try to pull them under and get them to succumb to the temptation to try it again; this time making sure they succeed. Connor's overbearing family, only concerned about his GPA, or his making the varsity football team, or getting into an Ivy League college, offer no solace during his time of need. Feeling suicide is the only answer after a deeply emotional love affair ends, he takes a gun and points it to his chest before pulling the trigger. Tony, after many years in a juvenile home for a crime that still haunts him, decides to ease his feelings of despair and loneliness by swallowing a handful of pills, only to vomit them up and be found by the police lying on the sidewalk unconscious. Vanessa is a cutter. In order to ease her mind in any time of stress she slices her skin with anything sharp enough to do the job. One day, when she was drowning in her blue ocean of sadness, she cuts too deep. She feels herself slipping into the abyss until her younger brother, Bryan, walks in and finds her. When he calls for their ex-nurse Grandma, she is able to hold off death. After arriving at Aspen Springs, Connor, Tony, and Vanessa are introduced to a life under constant surveillance, strict routines, and hours and hours or counseling. Immediately the three form a bond, feeling drawn to one another as if they might be able to save each other from death. Together they navigate the regulations of the hospital and make progress toward healing as they tell each other their deepest, darkest secrets; things they won't even tell their counselors. Ellen Hopkins uses her wonderful free verse style to weave together the story of three troubled teens as they attempt to heal the terrible scars left by their lives. The consistency the author uses when alternating the points of view makes the story easy to follow. Hopkins gives away just enough information that the reader feels a part of the story while still saving a big bang for the end. IMPULSE is a great story that reveals the importance of family during the healing process and is a must read for anyone who knows a teen. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780064472685,"This book has the first two stories in the Chrestomanci series. The first is called ""Charmed Life"" and the second ""The lives of Christopher Chant"". Chrestomanci is an enchanter who supervises the use of magic and so is more powerful than most magic people. Chrestomanci also has the task of looking for his/her successor. The first story takes us through the lives of Eric Chant and his witch sister (quite literally) who is called Gwendolen. Full of magic and some interesting twists, it's a great treat to read and I give it 4 stars. Then comes along the second story, which happens at least 25 years before the first and follows the life of Christopher Chant who is the Chrestomanci of the first story. This story is amazing! It's full of adventures, people from different worlds and gives us a lesson on true friendship - not to mention weird cats. The whole book gets 5 stars because the second story is really compelling. I had to make myself stop reading it so that it could last a little longer. Diana Wynne Jones always at her best.",Ines
9780064472685,"This story is about two orphaned siblings; Cat and Gwen. While Cat is extremely shy, Gwen is a recognized and powerful young witch. She gets herself brought to live in the castle of Chrestomanci, the most powerful magician, but things don't go according to her plan. A war of wills begins with magic used in every corner. Cat is afraid of his sister but when he gets a new sister, the fun really begins because Gwen has intentions to come back - with powerful and dangerous allies. This is the sequel to 'The charmed lives of Chirstopher Chant' but is an immensely enjoyable independent read. The book is funny, dramatic, fast paced with a subtle sense of humour running throughout it. It deals with magic in childhood and how extraordinary circumstances can bring out the best in all of us. The magic is explained as easily as simple science. The author shows amazing insights into the thoughts of children and how they fare in difficult circumstances. A beautiful and well written book.",Nadia Hussain
9780316122399,"I've wanted to read this since I first saw it last year before it was even released. I don't know what's taken me so long! The story takes place within 24-hours. I thought that would make the book drag, but it wasn't too bad. There are a lot of flashbacks so it doesn't feel like just 24-hours. It's the summer before Hadley's senior year of high school, and she's flying to see her father remarried. There's a lot of emotions that go along with the betrayal she felt when her dad left her and her mom. Jennifer, the author, does a great job portraying those raw emotions. I love the scenes with Oliver and Hadley, great chemistry. There's a bit of mystery surrounding Oliver and my prediction was totally false. :) I enjoyed the growth shown in Hadley's one day journey. This book was great with a wonderful romance! If you love YA contemporary romance, you'll love this book. Content Ratings: sexual: mild language: mild violence: none other: mild",Clean Teen Fiction

9781401237059,"I love Nightwing!! What a wonderful start for Dick Grayson in The New 52! I first really got to know Nightwing when I read Vol. 3 as I read through the ""Death of a Family"" arc and I ordered Vol. 1 & 2 right away as I knew I had to follow him from the beginning. He is one of my favourite Gotham characters. This first volume pretty much starts Nightwing off where he was pre-52, coming off of being The Batman and returning to his own beloved Nightwing. Dick meets up with Haly's Circus again and old friends, though not much backstory is given for him yet, we do get secondhand information, the tale of his parents death and a good feel for where he came from. This is pretty much a self-contained story that ends by the final issue and was a thrilling read with lots of surprises. Dick faces new enemies and only briefly crosses paths with Batgirl so not a lot of familiar faces leaving Nightwing as the main focus. The final issue brings in a small tie to the Court of Owls (which I've read) which was exciting (for me) to get that extra tidbit. Then the book sets up the beginning of the next arc. The art is fantastic. I adore Nightwing's costume and can't wait to catch up with Volume 2.",Nicola Mansfield
9780062059932,"America Singer lives in IlÂ©ï¸a, the former United States where society is broken up into eight different castes. One being part of the royal court. Two and Three being the wealthy. Four and Five being the working class. Six, Seven and Eight take up jobs serving the rest of the castes or none at all in Eighta??s case. The law states you must be married to have sex and not have any illegtemate children. What a crazy world she lives in. The royal family has a contest of sorts that picks the future wife and princess of Prince Maxon. Scores of girls enter, while America is pushed into entering by her boyfriend Aspen and mother. America is picked and she ends up living at the palace, befriending a friendly girl named Marelle, and a budding friendship with the Prince. I liked the beginning. It worked well setting up the plot, but then I got bored. There was a lot of filler scenes such as the photo shoots or watching the IlÂ©ï¸real Report. The amount of getting-to-know-each-other scenes were great , and their friendship seemed genuine, but you can just tell there was going to be more drama than it seemed. The ever infamous scandal over this book on GoodReads catapulted me into wondering if Wendy Darlinga??s review held truth. Indeed it did, but I didna??t hate it as much. I felt like the story could have been finished in one whole novel. It didna??t need to be dragged on as it was. If anyone paying the least amount of attention just by reading the synopsis knew what was gonna happen, raise their hand! *raises hand* I watched The Bachelor when it first came out. It was entertaining, yet cruel to watch as women threw themselves at the same man and watch as the jealously ebbed and flowed. Well it felt like I was reading The Bachelor as a book. Only with teenagers, and a royal family thrown into the mix. I get the plot. Ita??s easy. Who is Prince Maxon going to choose? Who is America going to choose?

9780062059932,"I'm starting this review by stating the main reason why I bought this book - its cover. When I first saw it I just fell in love with it and after passing my eyes through the synopsis, I knew this was going to be a good reading. And it was. I picked my copy up as soon as I got it in the mail. Read one chapter with the intention of killing the immense curiosity I had, and without even realizing it, I was already hooked by the end of the first couple of pages. I found the writing so simple, so straightforward, that I felt like I was having a conversation with a dear friend and that she was confiding me with all of her deepest secrets. Also, due to its easy prose, I couldn't help by reading the entire book in a matter of hours. Actually, it was already morning outside when my eyes started getting a bit blurry and I had to call it a day. I'm not sure if I, personally, would classify this book as a dystopian novel but I do understand why many people see it that way. The world building the author created does capture that essence, you feel a mix of Divergent meets The Hunger Games when it comes to castes and social divisions but that is as far as the comparison goes. Unfortunately, what started by being something really cool and interesting seeing the action was never stopped for the new society to be presented to the reader, it ended falling a little short for me. I seriously hope we get to see this new world explored to its maximum in the following books since its foundation sounds truly promising, although I do believe the romance will be the true core of The Elite, but hey, I might be wrong! I hope I am. About the characters, America Singer might have the most cliche name of the entire literary universe - even though it's possible to start liking it after a while. I did! -, but I do think she is a very compelling and passionate protagonist. She is strong and fragile at the same time, like all characters should be, and ultimately courageous seeing how much she has going on her life when she gets picked to be one of the Selected ladies in the run for Prince Maxon's hand. Plus, she's incredibly talented and super friendly and even when she feels like she doesn't want to be a part of such political games, she doest it anyway, for the more honoured reasons possible. What I kind of disliked about her was how sometimes she sounded a bit out of her edge for someone who is not accustomed on having close friends or any other people around her, so it looked like, at times, she was way too comfortable for hew own good, showing off a certain aggressive and hostile slashes of personality. As for the boys, I was betting my money on Aspen, right in the beginning due to their love appear to be so truthful and special, but the way the relationship came to an end - or to a pause, I'm not really sure - it flushed away all my sympathy for the guy. I understand that it is his job to provide for his family - and now for Mer as well - but I don't think that was enough reason to terminate such a powerful love. So... my attentions moved to Prince Maxon, who is kind and well educated and totally worthy of my compassion once I understood all the pressure he had on his shoulders. Personally, I would give him a bit more salt, just to spice him a little, but I have a strong feeling that a lot is going to change in book two. A lot! And I can't wait for it! The plot is really exciting, and once you get into the Selection show, it becomes a complete page-turner. In my opinion, I just think a couple of things were missing, such as more information regarding Maxon's interaction with the other contestants, more details about both the attacks and attackers - during the scenes where the palace was invaded - and, maybe, a little more tension in general, especially when it came to Celeste hating everybody and actually doing something about it. The big finale, well... was a little nerve-wracking. I think the way Aspen reappeared in Mer's life was a bit too expected, a cliche that could have been solved - and avoid - if the author had decided to give a different twist in the story, but the way America dealt with it by the end was the more mature and correct possible way. It also left a lot of doors open for the following book, which is awesome because we, as readers, get into that state of mind where we don't really know what to expect - in a good way! Overall, this was a great reading. The story was attention-grabbing, the characters were mysterious - and still have a lot to show! -, and the writing was just perfect for someone like me who is not very used to reading in English. And even though, initially, I was expecting something else in terms of storyline - don't ask me what exactly 'cause I don't know -, I truly loved this book. And now I'm anxiously waiting for the release of The Elite, which is to due out in mid April. Can't wait!",Patricia Pilar Pecegueiro
9780062059932,"The Selection drew me in from the beginning. I really connected with America. I could see similar character traits in her as myself, and then others that makes her stronger, others that I knew she had much room to grow and change. Character development and growth is really what gets me involved emotionally and otherwise in stories, and I knew that watching America would be a journey that I did not want to miss out on. I feel like I have read this before. And I can't figure out where. Maybe it is just my readings of Ester or a christian fiction that was based on Ester... But anyways. The addition of Aspen and her loving a lower class definitely makes it unique and puts America, the main character in a more precarious position. I understand completely her choosing to participate in the selection to help her family because while she isn't the lowest class, they do struggle for food. She also decides to do it because Aspen doesn't want to live with the guilt of holding her back. There was a lot of tension going into making this decision, and that was just the beginning of what kept me reading this book. The other girls in the competition were fun to read about. Some, like Marlee made me smile. She was so open and I loved the budding friendship between her and America. Others, like Celeste--well, let me just say that she made a perfect character to hate. There are others that I wished I could get a peek inside their mind and their time with Maxon. And oh, Maxon. At first, I thought much like America, that he was stuck up and unreachable. But as she got to know him, my heart melted and I was pulling for her to be able to leave Aspen in her past and chose him. Ms. Cass did a great job writing this and set this up, because I was all prepared to pull for first love and forbidden romance, but I loved the interactions between America and Maxon. How their friendship formed, and their bantering and open, vulnerable moments together. The ending completely took my breath away, and I can't wait for The Elite so I can figure out where America goes next in her journey, and figure out more to make my decision as well as find out hers. Bottom Line: Breath taking romance with an underdog main character that I was cheering for with all my heart.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780062059932,"Before I knew it, I'd finished the book in a blink of an eye... or so it seems. It was too good to keep down for long. The writing is light and imaginative as the author builds a world of castes, rebels and a government rearing against collapse. America is a wonderful character, in the young adult genre sense, because although she goes through the emotions of a typical girl, she knows how to keep them in check and take control of her situation. She's initially skeptical about Prince Maxon and the rest of the royal family, only because of outward perceptions, but she concedes to changing herself and her outlook on life, which in turn gives her strength. ""That was my great ambition. Not to be Illea's princess. To be Aspen's."" (15) I'm an admirer of Prince Maxon and his charisma, and I wish that Aspen would just stay out of the picture. I'm not sure why, but he annoys me now. I'm not a fan of love triangles and Aspen creeping his way back into America's life, just when she's trying to change, feels overbearing. With America's prolonged love for Aspen and questioning emotions over Prince Maxon, it will be interesting to find out who she chooses... if she chooses anyone... and how. She made it a point, which could be a premise for the second book, to take care of herself first. <b>First Line:</b> ""When we got the letter in the post, my mother was ecstatic.""

9780385754729,"OMG, this is by far the BEST historical fiction I've ever read! I think it's really clever and amazing that Zusak wrote this book from the Death's point of view. In the beginning,he kept me guessing and wondering who the narrator is, and this definitely catches my attention and one of the reasons that kept me go on reading it. This book really brings out the terrible situation of both the Jews and Germans in when they were under the control of Hitler. Well I've learned about the history of that time before, but I've never had such a strong feeling until I've read this book. One of the scenes that haunts me the most is the parade of Jews, how Liesel and Hans try to help them, but they can do nothing and get punished afterwards. This contrasts with the idea of discrimination against the Jews at that time strongly. I hate the ending though, I'm that kind of person who goes for a happy ending. Is it necessary that nearly all the good people have to die? I doubt that. But their deaths get me feel that life is really hard in Nazi Germany and not many people are as lucky as Liesel and Max.

In a sense the book is like a reality show: very enganging once your are in it, and easily forgotten when you are through. But we need books of that kind too, and I am actually looking forward to reading ""Sugar & Spice"".",Norwegian Book Girl
9780061767616,"This second novel in the L.A. CANDY series starts off where the first one left off. Jane Roberts, star of the hit reality TV show L.A. Candy, finds herself in the middle of a national scandal after a tabloid prints some photos of her in a rather compromising position. Not knowing what to do or where to turn, Jane takes the advice of her castmate, Madison, and takes off to Cabo for some much needed peace and quiet with Madison by her side to comfort and console her. Jane can't run forever though, and she can't keep ignoring the persistent phone calls of her concerned friends, family, and crew members, either. Facing reality, Jane heads back to L.A. to make things right. After leaving without as much as a word to let anyone know where she went, everyone is pretty upset with Jane. Her roommate, Scarlett, can't believe that Jane took off with that two-faced master manipulator, Madison. Scarlett tries to explain to Jane that Madison is the one who leaked the photos...but Jane won't listen and this causes a rift in their long-time friendship. At this point, Jane doesn't know who she can trust anymore. To further complicate things, Jane's heartthrob boyfriend, Jesse, is willing to take her back after she publicly humiliated him by cheating on him with his best friend, Braden. Though Jane loves Jesse (or at least she thinks she does), she really can't deny her feelings for Braden. As Jane and Jesse's relationship becomes more and more turbulent - and abusive - Jane has to decide what she really wants. Does she really want the cameras altering her life to fit what works for the show? Or does she want her old life back, where she wasn't America's Sweetheart and she didn't have to do things just because the producer wanted her to? Showing that Hollywood life isn't always so glamorous, this novel really brings the series to another level. Though Jane is extremely naive about everything, it's still a suspenseful and intriguing page-turner. The only question is : Will Jane see the truth before it's too late? You'll have to read on to find out.",TeensReadToo
9780374384678,"I wanted to read The Winner's Curse because I am a big fan of forbidden love when written correctly and what is that more than ""master"" and a slave. I also appreciate when a female lead is strong and Kestrel certainly fills that role. I've also read so many positive reviews from blogger buddies, that I knew I had to give it a read. The world building is nice and it transports me to a different world where women must marry or be a soldier and the in between required escorts among other restrictions. I could picture Kestrel walking down the street to the market with her friend Jess, sweating it out in the slave auction, and playing furiously on the piano or in the stables or blacksmith forge with Arin. I don't know if I am just getting more used to it but the 3rd pov didn't distract me or take away from how much I enjoyed the read. It also gives us a different access to both Arin and Kestrel. The characters of both Arin and Kestrel fascinated me and I really enjoyed their scenes together, working around their chemistry, but also the entire forbiddeness of it all. But neither can resist spending time with the other. Even with the complications of Kestrel officially owning Arin, and then the whole twist of Arin's purpose and how that effects their relationship. Its hard to talk about some of the things that really impacted me, because the twists are serious spoilers and some of it surprised me and others it just hurt to watch all of the heartache and tragedy. The changing dynamics between Arin and Kestrel though was fascinating to watch and how each responded to the changes. I can totally see where both are coming from keeping their secrets and doing things that may seem wrong but just having the other's best interest at heart. Not only is Kestrel dealing with her feelings for her slave, she also has the expectations of her high ranking father. She doesn't want to marry, and she doesn't want to enter the military. But she feels the pressure and wants to please her dad. She has some interest in warfare but not so much sword play and she doesn't want to give up her music. That is one of the things that created the initial combined interests/loves between her and Arin. But she also has no interest in the kind of men courting her. The ending was shocking and full of action and changes, betrayals, secrets that catch up to each other, as well as the feelings for each other that just won't go away and complicates their every decision. I can't wait until the next book and I am so glad that I paid attention to the hype for this book and was finally able to get a chance to read it. Bottom Line: Characters steal the show but still lots of action and a seriously forbidden love.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780374384678,"The cover for The Winner's Curse is pretty (YES, it is) but it doesn't do the story justice at all. This story is, in a few words, devastating, gripping, and thrilling! I haven't stopped thinking about this book since I finished reading it. I've just been pining away for more! The Winner's Curse is a low fantasy read, ideal for those who like a little bit of political intrigue and a great setting in their books. Reasons to Read: 1. Low fantasy at its best: I love (all) fantasy books and while I prefer high fantasy, The Winner's Curse is a one of the best low fantasy books I've ever read. (Sidenote: I'm putting The Winner's Curse in the low fantasy category because while it's a fictional world, the way the world works is rational and real and doesn't contain magical or impossible elements). There's less suspension of belief for readers, which is fantastic for readers who are less interested by magic. While the world is fictional there are some aspects which reminded me of other historical settings. 2. Oh my, swoons!: Do you like your romance to be epic?! Pick up The Winner's Curse - trust me. While the romance takes centre stage in this story, it also wasn't sappy or ridiculous. I was absolutely swept away by Arin and Kestrel and I couldn't get enough of these two. Most of all I loved how they tried to figure each other out, but still remained their rational thinking. And the tension just dragged on forever! So much tension that just wouldn't go away and it was brilliant. I liked Kestrel so much - she stood out on her own and had a vivid personality. She was such a clever girl, yet she had her own faults and she had to overcome those and work with it. But overall, Kestrel is an incredibly strong heroine. 3. An explosive story: I couldn't get enough of the politics and culture incorporated in The Winner's Curse. I was enthralled by these little details, and I'm dying to know what happens to this world in the next book. The plot development was my absolute favourite part of this book! It is beautifully written and the story is so captivating. I am dreaming about this book, its characters, and its world. I cannot let it go. I'm in love with it too much. The characters are flawed which is good, but this also means they aren't instantly likeable. My appreciation for them only grew over time as the story progressed and I was skeptical of Kestrel, in particular, at first. There were also a couple subplots that didn't seem to influence the main plot; maybe they'll come up in later books, but they didn't seem particularly relevant for this book. The Winner's Curse was one of my favourite books released this year so far. I've rarely felt so invested in a book series before, and I have such high hopes for the next one! The situation Arin and Kestrel are put in is so difficult as they're both forced to question values and beliefs they've held for such a long time - The Winner's Curse is reading for that alone. ARC received from Macmillan for review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9780374384678,"I know you guys must have seen about 1000 of these reviews so I'll keep it short and sweet . Kestrel is a powerful General's daughter, the very same General who was in charge of leading the raid on Arin's home land that led to Arin loosing everything and becoming a slave. As a woman Kestrel is expected to marry or become a soldier in her father's army, but the only thing Kestrel really wants to do is play the piano. Then she buys Arin on a strange impulse once she hears he can sing and after a rocky start the two find in each other kindred spirits. Unfortunately this is not a happy love story and as tensions run high and a rebellion threatens to destroy everything Kestrel knows she must chose carefully and find a way to play the game without risking it all. The Winner's Curse was a very well written novel about two young people trying to cope in an impossible situation with growing feelings for each other that they both believe to be wrong. The writing in this novel was stunning and the world was very quickly built around our characters in a way that didn't feel like info dumping but also didn't leave you confused as to what was going on. It was all very precise and incredibly well done. However, don't be fooled, this is not a typical epic fantasy about the world, magic and struggles going on. This is very much the tale of two people caught in the centre of the storm trying to figure out how to make it out with their heads and hearts intact. Kestrel is an intelligent and determined young woman who wants nothing more than to be herself. She does not have the same bloodlust that her people pride themselves on and wants nothing to do with slavery or the military. She very much wears her heart on her sleeve when it comes to the people she cares about, even though she likes to think of her self as someone who is good at bluffing in a game of Bite & Sting. Arin is a bit more of a mystery and explaining him to you might ruin your experience of reading the novel. I expected a bit more passion and a bit more denial through out the novel but even though the romance is slow burning it isn't denied, there just isn't time in the novel before all hell breaks loose and loyalties are tested. Overall, this is a very promising first novel in a series I'm sure I'm going to love.",Iona
9780374384678,"There's so much about this book that is good and generates lots of feels! I really don't want to go into too many details because I'm so tempted to de-brief and release some spoilers. Things that were great... the world building. This world is not set in a specific time period and does not operate in the ""real world"". The care Rutkoski puts into building up a world with customs, traditions and various languages is intentional and done with precise care. There's are several scenes where the narration describes hidden nooks and crannies within the society where you can visualize the layout of a house, town, etc. The author's notes do reveal that inspiration is drawn from the periods of Rome and Grecian empires. You can see this in the availability of technology, currency/trade and clothing. The characters are pretty awesome too! From swoon-worthy to creepy they're all in there... Kestrel is a strong girl having been raised by her father and a slave caretaker. However, privileged life has left her without basic knowledge such as how to do laundry or sew. What she lacks in blue-collar skills she makes up for in brains, specifically war strategy and gambling, and musicianship. She's firm, strong-willed, but not careless. Measuring every move she makes, she's aware of the consequences and weighs the outcomes. Kestrel is a feminist protagonist dispelling the stereotypes of reckless decision making, stubbornness, and a romantic lush. She knows what is expected of her, how to barter and when to play the right card..err...tile. Arin is handsome, deliberate and basically has all the feels for Kestrel. I think it's funny that the synopsis places Kestrel as the dominate ""liker"", I definitely think Arin is more obvious in his affections. Arin is also a master in game playing. The beginnings of the ""relationship"" are more quid pro quo then slave-to-master in nature. Trading a win for a secret and then transitioning into larger odds as the camaraderie develops over time. Yay, no instant love! But, plenty of ahh's, ooo's and swoons. The secondary characters are likable and equally hate-able. Particularly the auctioneer. *shudders* I felt like he was trying to sell me a 1976 Pinto with no A/C in Texas. Creeper! I'm naming him the character I love to hate. Favorite secondary characters would be Ronin, who tries hard to win the affections of Kestrel, and Irex, Kestrel's gambling buddy who hates to lose. About 2/3 through the book I really felt like the storyline was a mix between Disney's Beauty and the Beast and Pocahontas. However, I can't go into why that is so without giving too much away. The pacing is a bit choppy which periods of movement and then lulls. I expect this in book one of a series since so much is put into the world building, so its worth it to me. Overall, due to the game playing nature of the lead characters the story keeps you on your toes because you never know what truth will be revealed next. And is it the truth? Last but not least, the writing is quote worthy. I think I highlighted more quotes than I ever have before. I also enjoyed a straight narrative versus a point-of-view book. I feel like POV is the trend in YA series and I'm always left wanting more. I need a three-dimensional story versus waiting for a novella to pop up after the fact. (4.5/5)",Meghann

9781849419260,"Favourite Quote a?? a??Saba used to say there was a difference between bravery and courage. Bravery was doing something dangerous without thinking. Courage was walking into danger, knowing full well the risks.a?? After reading Just One Day and loving it, I knew I had to get this ASAP! Ia??m sad to admit, I was deeply disappointed in this book and give this book a 3/5 stars! I think I was disappointed because it was completely different to what I was expecting. I thought the book would be split into two parts, the first being Willema??s year since that day in Paris and the second part would continue were the first book left off. It never went down like that. The whole book was about Willema??s year and the ending was practically the same as the first book! It was quite open-ended in my opinion, I never got the closure I wanted and I think that is what upset me the most. Okay, that is my rant over! Onto an actual review of the book. The plot of the book was okay, some of it was interesting, like Willema??s relationship with his mother and learning some of the Indian culture but I felt a lot of it was bland and boring, especially towards the end where I was skimming most of the pages! Like I said before the ending was not my cup of tea but I can see why the author left it this way. As for the characters, I thought I was going to love Willem but in reality he was like the plot, just okay for me. He was a lost soul and I felt for him because of that, but some of his ideas/thoughts/actions I didna??t like or agree with and that put me off him a little. As for the other side characters, his mother grew on me towards the end! And I liked his Dutch friends but the other characters a?? I cana??t even remember their names a?? were not that memorable!

9780061726811,"Originally reviewed on my blog http://ryanndannelly.blogspot.com What I thought made this book so effective was Samantha?C/??s voice. She starts off so self-consumed and oblivious to the impact of her actions on anyone else. During the first hundred pages, I grew to hate Samantha so much that I didn?C/??t feel bad about her death. But when that day?C/??s finished, Oliver essentially calls me out, the reader, for having that exact reaction. When I got to that part, I felt slimy for not caring that this teenager was killed. It was a brilliant moment, extremely though-provoking. I reread that scene four times through before I could move on. It worked so well because Samantha voice starts off so distinctly unlikable, which then as the story progresses transforms into a better person. The story arc of Samantha?C/??s journey in how she comes to terms with her death is realistic, pulling the reader through this emotional journey with her. As she goes through the five stages toward reaching acceptance, so does the reader. During each particular day when she?C/??s angry, sad, hopeless, and regretful, the reader feels her emotions as well, empathizing with each reaction. When Samantha finally reaches a state of peace and acceptance, the reader does too. This book will make you reevaluate how you view people?C/??particularly the people you don?C/??t particularly like. It?C/??ll make you question love and death and will leave you thinking about how your actions and decisions affect the people around you. Like many YA contemporary books, it?C/??s an easy read. I flew through the pages in no time. But the impact and takeaway to this story is still insurmountable. If you enjoyed YA contemporary stories that focus on life, love, and death, like Gayle Forman?C/??s If I Stay, you should definitely check this book out.",Ryann Dannelly
9780061726811,"Originally reviewed on my blog: http://sikbookreviews.blogspot.ca When I first started reading this book, I was sure I was going to give it a horrible rating. However, I clearly changed my mind by the time I finished reading it. At first, the story seems very juvenile. It begins in a seemingly immature manner with the narrator telling her story of how popular she is and how she gets everything she wants in life and so on. These grade 12 girls seemed annoying to me (admittedly, this may be because I am not a teenage girl!) and I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get through the entire book. They are popular and seemingly-slutty girls who only seemed to talk about boys and sex. I also didn't feel any sympathy, or a connection, toward the narrator. Suffice it to say I was not happy with the beginning of the book. I thought: bad plot development, bad character development, immature writing, typical debut novel. And for a beginning like this (with the narrator on her way to her death), you would think that it would catch the reader's interest immediately. But I found myself not even caring what happened to this girl and her friends. At first. About half way through the book, I found myself becoming more interested in the story and in the narrator. Sam was growing as a character, which made her more deserving of my sympathy. I began caring about her and what might happen to her. I ended up finally giving two hoots if she did die. I didn't want her to die, especially now that she is growing into a better and more mature person! I won't say if she actually does die or not, as I don't want to give away the ending. But, I got more into the book as it continued on. The ending was also a tad bit disappointing, but I did not hate it as much as the beginning! The ending seemed like it could have maybe been a bit longer. It ended so suddenly. One minute I was reading and captivated by the story and the next thing I knew it was over. Not a well-constructed ending in my opinion. I'm not sure if I would suggest reading this book. But if you decide to, just be prepared for a bad beginning and if you can make it through and keep reading, the story and character development will get better. Teens might like this book more than adults, as it seems a bit immature for my liking.",Sam
9781408319468,"Finally! A book that is actually a dystopian novel in the classic sense of the word (in which society tries to be an utopia, but with a major flaw,) and not another one of those ""let's just call it dystopian and claim its the next Hunger Games while we're at it"" novels. In Slated, children under sixteen that are deemed detrimental to society (e.g. criminals, terrorists, rebels) will be given a second chance by having their memories wiped and living with a new adoptive family. Slaters are then required to wear a Levo, a bracelet that monitors happiness and negativity. When the user drops too low, the bracelet shocks the user before they can harm society. At first it seems that all is good, until more and more citizens disappear for trivial misconduct and citizens fear government is abusing their power. Slated reminded me of why I love the dystopian genre: its speculative nature is thought-provoking and a great starting point for ethical discussions. However, as much as this futuristic dystopia excited me, the novel as a whole did not. It's not that Slated by Teri Terry had many faults, but just that it didn't stand out and felt slightly heavy-handed at times. The slow pace also failed to hold my attention. However, I still think it succeeded in raising important questions like self-identity (without memories, who are you?) and the nature vs. nuture debate. Heavy-Handed Writing (Stop it! I am not stupid here!): I am a fan of the dystopian genre for its introspective qualities, its tendency to make us reconsider moral dilemmas. It's because I feel what makes a dystopian novel special hinges on its ability to think that makes me extra critical of how ideas are presented in Slated. It was annoying to hear Ben (the love interest) rant on and on about being mind-controlled by the government, that there was no freedom. Okay! I get it. Freedom = good, Mind-Control = Bad. Duh. Now convince me without shoving it down my throat.Another problem with heavy-handed writing arose when it came to characterizing Kyla. In a scene Kyla cries after eating broccoli (I guess she really does hate broccoli or it reminds her of some traumatic experience--it's never explained.) After her cryfest, Kyla thinks: ""And the way I cried, in great gulpy sobs. I didn't know how to cry, I wasn't good at it: it wasn't something I did."" This sentence annoyed me. It was an obvious (and disastrous) attempt to shoehorn in this notion of Kyla being stronger than she appears, to discount her broccoli breakdown--all because SHE'S NOT GOOD AT CRYING. GASP. IT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE DOES! I didn't even know crying was a skill! Can someone tell me how to be better at crying because apparently ""great gulpy sobs"" is not the way to go? And how would she know if its something she did? She just had her memory erased! Girl couldn't even figure out how to open a car door. How dare she think she's knowledgeable in the art of crying! Not Quite Original--At Least To Me: The more I read, the more Slated seemed like a culmination of other stories I've read. I realize that this is more of a personal issue as I've been reading quite a few ""dystopian"" novels recently. The reason I mention this is not because I think ideas were copied, but because I think having read these novels hindered my experience with Slated, making me draw parallels amongst them (as I will explain further later.) With that said, Slated read to me like a better version of Theo Lawrence's Mystic City plot-wise, and Kiersten White's Mind Games tone-wise (especially at the end.) If you like either or both of these books, you might really love Slated. If you had issues with them (like I did,) I don't think Slated would win you any favors. If you haven't read them, you are safe. Lastly, social criticism, the foundation of a dystopian story, echoed ideas from George Orwell's 1984 where the government seems to be constantly watching you. Kyla Davis, The One Who Feels The Need To Constantly Remind Us That She's Different: The depressing, monotonous voice of Kyla was one of my major issues because it made the story move at a snail-like pace. Here is where having read Kiersten White's Mind Games may have hindered my reading slightly. Kyla's voice reminded me of Fia from Mind Games. Like Fia, there is internal monologue. And while Kyla is not nearly as annoying Fia with her tendency to repeat words like she's on drugs, but Kyla does repeat ""Kyla is different."" quite a bit. Like Fia, Kyla also acts on instincts--which are never wrong apparently. But we already sense that she's different early on--because she seems to be the only Slated that isn't enjoying life. Her constant reaffirmation of her difference not only seems redundant, but also narcissistic. Yes, Kyla, you are the special snowflake. You really don't have to remind me every ten minutes. I don't like her and I having her narrate the story wasn't the best idea. She's a reclusive, passive character who seems to spend all her time either running, drawing, and going to therapy. When she's not doing those things, she trains her poker face while trying to navigate around the multitude of adults whose intentions are unclear. She can't trust anyone--except the guy she has the hots for. Even though he isn't too bright. You have to get used to her running because she does it A LOT. Basically one of those characters that don't try to make friends, don't laugh, and are not generally pleasant to be around, but are ""bullied,"" so they automatically turn into a nice person. Or at least decent compared than everyone else. It's really not hard to seem like a nice person, when the entire school is only made up of jealous, shallow teenage girls set on bullying you if their love interest so much as winks at you. You know that poker face I mentioned earlier? Kyla NEEDS it. If not for her own benefit, then for mines. Apparently Kyla is horrible at keeping secrets because her face is an open book, and there have been countless instances where people say stuff life, ""I know you are lying! Tell me the truth!"" to Kyla. It gets tiring after awhile, reminding me of those stereotypical girls who think something MUST be wrong if their boyfriends are silent. However, giving a Kyla a reason to always have a poker face made her even more banal. So on top having no personality, she can't even emote her feelings now. The last shreds of hope I had of Kyla being more compelling than a plank of wood just vanished. Ben, Why Does He Like Kyla? Enter Mr. Nice Guy, who is obviously Kyla's love interest. I have no idea WHY, but he likes Kyla. Ben makes his intentions clear early, but Kyla spends a huge chunk of the book assuming he likes Tori (the beautiful girl) which was frustrating because evidence shows that they are really just regular friends at best. Why would you think he likes a girl he didn't even realize was missing for days? HE EVEN TOLD YOU THAT THEY ARE JUST FRIENDS AND HE TOLD YOU THAT HE LIKES YOU. Her peers claim that Tori isn't even his type (apparently his type are the incredibly slow and dense boring ones.) Perhaps it's her lack of self-confidence that make it unfathomable for her that anyone would ever like her. I which case, she's not alone. I have no idea why anyone would like her either. Despite the fact that the adults adore him and his friendliness, Ben is not too bright. Part of it might be due to being Slated, and how it makes you more susceptible to manipulation, but I'm not convinced. Even when he is supposedly free to think for himself--he acts even stupider and doesn't plan things through. He is just so simple-minded! Here is where reading Theo Lawrence's Mystic City might have influenced my reading experience. Like Slated, Theo Lawrence's Mystic City is also about a girl who has her memory erased. In Mystic City, the protagonist forgets her rebel boyfriend. I am NOT sure if this is what happened in Slated, but there are clues to it plausible as Kyla claims Ben to feel familiar in many instances. In Mystic City, I felt that establishing the lovers past relationship was a cop-out to making it ""okay"" for the lovers to make sickeningly saccharine love proclamations. ""It isn't instalove! They really had a deep and passionate relationship! I PROMISE. JUST TRUST ME. So it it's okay for them to claim that they can't live without one another!"" It was a sign of weakness in Mystic City, and I was glad Slated didn't resort to that (though I was very suspicious.) However, another part of me thinks this it might benefit Slated if our couple did have a past history, because right now--I don't buy their relationship. [SPOILER ALERT: Why did he have to run off to join a terrorist group when he would be free at 21 anyway? Wouldn't it be better to wait? Then he could stay in school and BE SMARTER. ] Uncle Wayne, The Crazy Guy. Or Is He? Uncle Wayne is a minor character, though he plays a major role at the end. As minor characters go, Slated has A LOT of them making them hard to keep track of. Just when you think you got the cast down, another character pops out of nowhere. Wayne is exceptionally memorable because he is supposedly ""crazy"" with stalker-ish intentions. Yet, Kyla, against her better judgment, always runs into him. He is the character I felt was most cheated because I felt sympathetic towards him. Wayne is the uncle of Phoebe, another one of Kyla's school bullies. It is later revealed that Pheobe saves Kyla's cat. But soon after she is taken away by officials, never to be seen again presumably due to Kyla's tattling. He, reasonably, holds Kyla responsible for his niece's disappearance. Despite his hostile behavior towards Kyla, I felt it was justified and made me visualize him as the loving uncle who cares deeply about his niece. To my disappointment, somewhere along the way, Wayne is no longer the loving uncle, and instead given the role of ""bad guy"" to move the plot along. And probably so Kyla can come out looking like a saint once again. It's a pity that he is also given one of the most awkward lines in the entire novel: ""Nice to me, Phoebe was."" I know rearranging sentence structure can be an artistic choice, but can go wrong in dialogue. This line not only sounds weird on the tongue, but also suggests the relationship isn't quite normal. As if there's a reason why Phoebe shouldn't be nice to her uncle. As if Wayne is an abandoned pet, and Phoebe was nice to him out of compassion. OR Wayne only cares about his niece because she was nice to him. Of course, the unconventional sentence structure may also be used to convey the oddity of Uncle Wayne. Admittedly, I am nitpicking at ONE SENTENCE, but I just really wanted Uncle Wayne to redeem himself somehow. Mostly I just wanted someone to beat up Kyla just so she learns to RUN when faced with danger and not walk straight into it. Oh, and Kyla also hates broccoli. howcanyouhatebroccoli,itslikemyfavoritegreenvegetable?! Maybe she was force fed broccoli as a child? I would love to know. Wordbuilding and Plot: Juvenile When You Think About It: As much as I love the concept, the more I think about the Slated society, the cornier it becomes. In an effort to prevent crime, criminals and terrorists under 16 will be slated. You'll be under government surveillance until 21. Before then, the government pays for your hospital fees and therapy. I'm not sure what happens after you're 21, I assume they take your Levo off and let you roam free. I don't know who came up with this slated program, but it seems like more trouble than it's worth. How people under 16 are running off BEING TERRORISTS? AND CRIMINALS? What crime could they ever commit? Steal gum? Actually, getting your brain washed for stealing gum might be an effective deterrent. The only plausible situation I can come up with is a secret group of rebels kidnapping children to carry out crimes, telling them nothing will happen to them with the slated system in place. Maybe this is why Ben ad Kyla are so good at running--because they are trained to run from police. Apparently children are more susceptible to manipulation after being slated, but if my theory is correct: they didn't know how to think for themselves to begin with. Overall, Slated just very disappointing. I liked that it aimed to be contemplative novel that makes us question morals, but as entertainment--I was not impressed. I blame this on Kyla for being as boring as a plank of wood. She MAY seem likable, but it's just an illusion due to everyone else being bullies. Despite my gripes, I still see her as a realistic character, and I liked her tendency to question things. But, I still wish she could crack a joke. Or at least smile once. At first, I thought Kiersten White's Mind Games and Teri Terry's Slated was only similar in character voices. After I read the last few pages, the plot might also be similar. I wasn't a fan of Mind Games, and I fear Fractured, the sequel to Slated, will be an duplicate of that experience.",Lilian (A Novel Toybox)
9781408319468,"(Source: I won a copy of this book! Thanks to Jenny from 'Chocolate Chunky Monkie', and Orchard Books.) It's been 9 months since 16-year-old Kyla was slated (a process that strips you of your memories). She's learned to walk and talk again, and now it's time for her to leave the hospital with her new foster parents. Kyla is different though, unlike all the other mindless 'slateds', Kyla asks questions she shouldn't, and has trouble keeping her monitoring device (Levo) in the 'safe' zone (Slateds are supposed to be 'level' - not too happy or too sad). Kyla slowly adapts to the new life that she has been given, but the 'Lorders' (the men who maintain the peace), scare her, and she begins to question things even more when people she knows are taken away by the Lorders never to return. Luckily, Kyla does make friends with another slater - Ben, and also has her slated sister Amy, and her new mom looking out for her. What exactly is happening though? Why was Kyla slated? And why is she different? I liked this book, although for a lot of it I felt like I was trapped in the dark with Kyla. Kyla knew very little, but had a thirst for knowledge that made her different from the other 'slateds'. She didn't know why she was slated, and she wasn't sure she that she wanted to know, although she did know that not everyone who had been slated had had it done to them legally. I liked the way that Kyla used art as an escape, and how she often learned things by drawing, and then working out what the drawings meant. Kyla had a very active mind for someone who had been slated, as it seemed that the other 'slateds' were a little ditzy and clueless, which wasn't really Kyla at all. Being slated seems a bit of a scary prospect, although I'm sure plenty of people would love to have the option to forget about their current lives and start over fresh. To do this to someone without their consent is truly despicable though, although I suppose it is slightly better than executing them. I liked the storyline in this book, although I did think it was quite slowly paced. This was quite a long book at nearly 450 pages, but a lot of it was taken up with Kyla's reintroduction into society, rather than what was actually going on with regard to people being slated, and the 'Lorders'. What I did want more information on was why exactly certain people were taken. I never really understood why one of Kyla's classmates was taken, and I didn't really get it when a teacher was then taken, purely for making comment about the classmate being taken. Not really sure why this was such a problem? It seemed that anybody could be taken at any moment on a whim, and it just wasn't obvious enough what exactly the government were trying to hide, why they took these people, and what their overall game-plan was. Kyla did find out some information regarding her own slating, but not enough to really tell her what happened, or what was supposed to happen, although I'm hoping we find out more about this in the sequel. Kyla and Ben's relationship felt a little odd to me, but I think that was mostly because Ben was a little slater-ish and ditzy at times which sort of put me off him a bit. It was nice to see how different Ben, and Kyla's adopted sister Amy were compared to Kyla, as Kyla really did seem to behave differently to the other 'slateds'. Thankfully the action seemed to step up in the last 50ish pages, and things happened that I wasn't expecting. Something else happened that I had kind-of guessed at (there were hints throughout the book), but we were left with loads of unanswered questions at the end. Overall; this book had an interesting premise, but the pace felt a little slow to me. I would be interested to find out what happens to Kyla in the sequel, but I'm not desperate to read it, if you know what I mean. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781408319468,Slated. 5 of 5 star rating. No review.,Kate
9781408319468,Slated is definitely a page turner. But once you put it down you are to realize nothing actually happened. This is book one of another young adult book series. The story and ideas are unforgettable and are difficult to argue with. In this book it seems as if the story hasn't even began yet at 439 pages you'd think the protagonist would have made a difference by now. This is a story not finished. I would advise to wait till 2013 when Book 2 comes out (around May) called Fractured before reading it.,Lisa Scott
9781408319468,"I read The Hunger Games series not long ago and was convinced it was the best book I had ever read. After reading it I couldn't get into any book, none of them seemed to compare. Not even Nicholas Sparks who was my favourite author. I went from book to book trying to find one to keep my attention for long enough. I saw 'Slated' in the shop and the blurb sounded interesting. I didn't really expect what I read though. 'Slated' is probably the most unique, unforgettable and interesting book ever. Infact if I had to chose between this and The Hunger Games, I couldn't...and that is saying something. The book kept me guessing throughout, and this kept me curious. I couldn't put it down and I read it in just over a weekend. The small bit of romance is perfect to keep you interested but not make you sick.The ending was surprising and I also felt a pang of sympathy for Kyla. I am just upset I have to wait a whole year for the second. This is a perfect book, infact rating it 5 stars is too low;It deserves 10! I deffiantly suggest this book to anyone! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED! This is deffiantly",Megan-Jo
9781408319468,"Kyla was different. Kyla was Slated. She didn't have the eternal-I'm-harmless-and-oblivious-smile that was pasted on the faces of young Slateds. She was very curious about everything around her. It had become her way of coping - mapping out her world and discovering every detail about it, including details that could get her in trouble. I liked Kyla a lot. I admired how she remained true to herself while adjusting to her world. Most of all, she sought out the truth behind every lie and she never gave up on that search. The concept of Slated was terrifying for me. The idea of being Slated - losing your memories, your personality and your family, starting over without knowing how to claim your life as your own and how to find place in this all-new-world - was too much. Slateds were held back by manacles aka Levos, devices that looks like wristwatches that detect and measure their level of happiness. The stable level was 5 but if a Slated's level would go down, it could lead to blacking out, seizures or worse, death. It was startling to know that they were forced to adjust to their new life with those Levos on. When you're new, you're bound to get upset, sad, frustrated and even angry at this phase. Ben was a well-adjusted Slated. Everybody seemed to like him. He was nice to everyone, including Kyla. As the two became friends, they found out startling things about themselves and the society they belonged to. Lorders, people who maintained Law and Order, were always in school gatherings. People went missing and were taken for granted. No one seemed to be concerned about them. No one mentioned the missing, as if they didn't exist anymore. It seemed that everybody who said the wrong thing at the wrong moment was caught. The tension intensified even more as terrorists made their move. But on top of it all, one of the things that really bothered Ben and Kyla was this: Ben, along with other Slateds, couldn't seem to think for himself, couldn't seem to notice things that were oh so wrong in Kyla's eyes. The government messed with their brains. I enjoyed and savored every page of Slated. It was the kind of novel that took both of your hands and pulled you into its pages, making you hesitant and even unwilling to leave it. As I questioned along with Kyla, I was struck with horror and repulsion at how people could easily be manipulated and silenced in her world. There was too much sugarcoating on every word that people spoke. People hid the truth with perfect smiles and nonchalant gestures. Kyla dug deep for answers. She certainly wanted them and she was willing to take risks. But when she does find them, things will never be the same for her. Another thing I liked about Slated was the fact that not one character was the same from beginning to end. As the story progressed, I witnessed how their multilayered skins and masks peeled off to reveal their cores underneath. Every character had his/her own surprising revelation. Secret after secret exploded in this intense dystopian. Slated is an addictive and unforgettable page-turner that is brimming with deception, suspense and mystery. With a smart, curious and inquisitive Slated heroine, plunge into the futuristic, intense and secret-filled story world of Slated. If you're looking for a great May debut, this one is for you! I highly recommend this to dystopian and post-apocalyptic readers and mystery readers!",Precious

Designated Fat Ugly Friend And with only these four words, one boy has the power to make a girl like Bianca our protagonist feel like only second choice or none at all. Wesley is that very macho guy, known as the school's male ****, who keeps bothering Bianca throughout the entire story. Still Wesley is just the boy a girl like Bianca needs. She uses him as he uses her. And exactly the knowledge of him not caring about her seems to make it easy for Bianca to start distracting her troubled thoughts with him. It's no love at first sight and not the sweetest romance of YA contemporary. Therefore their relationship is rough and carnal. Very different from others, nonetheless attractive. I like that Bianca and Wesley are both so different in personality and yet they've got a lot in common. Although Wesley's the school ****, I couldn't but fall for his extreme charm and ...advantages. Their problems at home make these two characters, that appear shallow for only looking for physical contact, appear more sympathetic and one starts to feel for both of them. We meet their friends and families and see the effects their relationship has on their individual lives. There's a lot of sex. Raw, instinctive and meaningless. THE DUFF for once stands for another kind of contemporary romance. It shows that there doesn't need to be that long painful struggle to get the guy you want. You can get him first and realise your feelings later. Don't be afraid, there is still a big chaos of all kinds of emotions waiting for Bianca and Wesley.You'll get the full package! It's about teenage life and the difficult ways of falling in love, but also about the feeling of being a bad version of someone else, less attractive, less funny, smart, you name it. Kody Keplinger shows all the teenage girls and boys that there's no need to feel like that. The message is about friendship and accepting yourself the way you are, no need to compare yourself to others and feel less important or clever or beautiful. You are just perfect the way you are! THE VERDICT THE DUFF- A snappy, witty, feel-good novel. A sexy debut about the struggles of a teenage life and the true meaning of being the Duff. THE DUFF carries a fantastic and important message and you should definitely not miss Kody Keplinger's awesome debut. A very different kind of love story, but one nonetheless thrilling and engaging!",MissPageTurner

(And don't even get me started on Patch's name). Time has passed. My feelings of dislike have faded somewhat and Hush, Hush has risen a little bit to a more ""okay"" place on my list. I lingers there with a few other books that are quite popular and it hovers over some others that I really could not stand. Crescendo was like a slap in the face. Not only was my dislike of Nora brought back.. but now she's displaying angst and emo-teenage-heartbreak worthy over only the queen of such herself, Bella Swan. The only reason this book rates as high as I've given it is because the rest of the plot (such as it was) was interesting and I liked seeing the bad boys get the spotlight here. But Nora? My goodness, someone needs to slap that girl. There is probably a 5% chance I'll read the final book. Even the cliffhanger wasn't enough to get me to be interested in reading it.

In this book, Cammie encounters a very disturbing and shocking news, where someone she dearly trusts turns out to be the ""bad guy"". This time, Cammie has to decide for herself, on who to trust and believe, which made it very interesting. Since starting this book, it was very catching. It caught me from the start, and i couldn't put it down. The events that were happening were fun and interesting. There was lots of suspense during the story, which made me want to know what happens next. Cammie, as always, was amazing. I love this girl! She is so strong and stubborn and always does what she sets her mind on doing. (Kinda like me! hehe) Her other three best friends are so supportive of her, and they would sacrifice their lives in order to protect her. They were friends anyone would wish to have. I liked how Zach was involved in this story. Cammie wasn't so sure about trusting him, and at the same time, she loved him. It was mixed feelings and Cammie was very confused, which gave it quiet a twist. I love Zach so i enjoyed reading every bit about him. He is so mysterious, and finally, in this book, you get to know many things about him. Im not gonna spoil anything, but you do learn some interesting facts about this young boy. Overall, it is a very interesting book. If you haven't read this series, i suggest that you do. I love spy books because i have this impossible dream of wanting to become a spy.

9780373210572,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Harlequin (UK) Limited and Netgalley.) Ethan Chase's sister Meghan disappeared years ago to become 'The Iron Queen' in the land of Nevernever (fairyland). Ethan isn't happy about that, but he's even less happy that he is constantly on the alert for faeries and constantly trying to stay out of trouble, and all because he can see Them. Starting at a new school, the last thing Ethan wants is to run in to a half-breed, especially one who doesn't want to leave him alone. But as this particular half-breed - Todd seems to be being chased by some sort of faery that Ethan has never seen before, he figures he should help. Then Todd disappears. Ending up chased by the very same freaky faeries that have kidnaped Todd, Ethan does the only thing he can do - escape to Nevernever, and ask his sister for help. Can Ethan rescue Todd though? What exactly are these weird faeries that nobody seems to remember? And what secrets is The Iron Queen hiding? Let me just start this review by saying that I haven't read 'The Iron Fey' series by Julie Kagawa from which this series is a spin-off. Loads of reviews that I have read have all been written by people who have, so I decided to do the opposite, and read this first. I'm sure there are plenty of you out there who haven't read the original series, but might be intrigued by this one, so let me just say that I enjoyed this book without having read the 'Iron Fey' series, and although I think there probably were spoilers form the previous books in this book, I was able to read this book without getting lost or confused, and I still intend to read the 'Iron Fey' series (just as soon as I get round to it - so hopefully before I die). Anyway, I found this book really captivating in the beginning, the first 20% of the book flew by, and I was glued to my kindle. Unfortunately I didn't feel quite this way further on in the book, by the middle my attention was lagging, but the book did then improve again towards the end (making this book quite difficult to rate!). I would have to say that I enjoyed it overall though. I liked Ethan, and I could understand why he wanted to keep a low-profile from the faeries. I got why Todd latched on to Ethan for help, and I liked the love interest - Kenzie. I liked the storyline, although the ending was left very open for the next book. I have to say that I'm interested as to what will happen to Kenzie especially after a shock revelation in this instalment. There were plenty of guest appearances from people who I'm guessing are in the 'Iron Fey' series, and I suppose I would have recognised these if I had read the previous books! There's also a cameo from Puck. Overall; I enjoyed this book, but I wasn't blown away by it. I will probably read the next in the series, mainly to find out what happens to Kenzie. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780373210572,"Well, I cant say I'm impressed at all. Was the story good? - it was okay but it was all just a little too familiar and predictable. Yes there were different characters, different fey, but after it's all said and done; it's the same scenario, the same formula, the same fight as the Iron Fey series. Sigh...I feel like I'm going to repeat myself, in fact, I think I will... There were no surprises, no twists and turns, nothing to make me gasp and squeal with shock, sorrow, happiness...it was all very...meh. Yep, that's exactly what I said about The Iron Knight (Iron Fey #4), and I wasn't terribly fussed with the entire series, which means I probably won't bother reading anymore of Ethan's books. I will say however, that I think the author writes a much better male voice than she does a female, even if Ethan is an annoying little snot. The writing is okay, the characters are okay, perhaps a little shallow, but okay, the storyline is okay - it was all okay, nothing flash, nothing to WOW about. Lovers of the original Iron Fey series will no doubt love this book, but as far as I'm concerned, The Lost Prince is a only worth a read when there's nothing else to do. 3 out of 5 stars :]",cath cowley

Pre-reading reactions: OMG! Another dose of Iron Fey series! Amazing. And, Ethan? The Lost Prince? He's also a fey?? o.O With that title, cover, and well, protagonist, you would really think that Ethan is a Prince. The lost Prince. But really, he isn't. I was actually guessing on some parts of the book when will the another truth will reveal, but it never came. Instead, a different revelation has emerged and another heavy dose of mystery. Being in Ethan's mind is definitely a change. Before, on the entire Iron Fey series, we've been on Meghan's and for the last book, Ash's. Ethan is quite different. One, is he hated the faes and their world. He never wanted to do anything from them. But alas, Julie Kagawa wrote another book about them, and he's not very fortunate to be in their world. Again. I liked the book, I really do. There are comebacks (of course. I just can't imagine how the fans will react if none of them showed in this book) of the Iron Fey series' famous characters. I just missed Grimalkin. And Puck. And Ash. I was actually wishing to get some more of them, but then again, it's Ethan's time to shine and the new characters. I also liked the new characters. They weren't just additional, they were also the building blocks of the book. There are some mentions about Filipino traditions/culture, and a Filipino martial art--which Ethan is very good at--that made me smile. Of course, I'm a Filipino. It's just a weird but nice feeling and all that. It was that..it's just rare, whatever. But honestly, I never heard of that martial art. LOL But hey, I knew all the Filipino words used (of course). :D It was a nice, refreshing comeback to the world of Kagawa's faes. I really missed it. *sniff* I experienced a fantasy with full of actions, magics, mystery, show-stopping scenes in the 4-book series of Iron Fey, but I think here in The Lost Prince, there was something missing. A final spice to make it all perfect. I think it's the excitement I felt before, because there were parts of this book I've predicted, so I think I lost it. But overall, I really liked it, and I would definitely check out the next installments of the series.

9780373210572,"I was in love with Ethan from the start. He is broody, and I connected with his voice. I could understand where he was coming from with his attitude and I liked the glimpses of the person he really is through the shell. I was also intrigued by Kenzie and her motivations as well as admiring her stubborness and tenacity. I loved the interactions between her and Ethan and they really drive the book for me. The addition of Kali, a type of martial art was a breath of fresh air. The relationship between Ethan and Guro is well written and I like having a role model like that in my stories. I like how he didn't press issues, but let Ethan know he was there for him, as well as expecting the best from Ethan. Julie Kagawa twines old familiar characters in and I smiled getting to see what they are up to now. It is neat seeing them from new eyes and seeing how the outside sees their relationships and dynamics. I wanted to know more but the ending didn't do it for me as far as wrapping up the plot. I liked how the epilogue ended things between Kenzie and Ethan though. I definitely want to know more about their lives and where their stories take them next. Bottom line: Absolute page turner.

9780373210572,"The Lost Prince by Julie Kagawa is the first book in the new Iron Fey series, The Iron Fey: Call of the Forgotten. It's about Ethan Chase, Meghan's younger brother from the original series. From the very first page I liked Ethan as a main character way more than I liked Meghan. Well, that's not entirely true. I really liked Meghan, but I loved the way Ethan came across in The Lost Prince. Ethan is a huge jerk for the first part of the book. And I loved that about him. He has his reasons, of course. If you've read the Iron Fey series you know how miserable faeries can make your life if they think you can see them. If not, well, you will find out. So Ethan pushes people away so they won't get hurt. It's interesting to see into the mind of a bad boy. To see why he acts the way he does. I really enjoyed reading about Ethan and watching him grow and change throughout the book. Kenzie, Ethan's love interest, is such a strong female character. Especially in a book narrated by a male protagonist. Usually, I find, that leading male characters don't always go right for the strong independent girls, but like to focus on the whiny, needy ones instead. But not Ethan. He goes right for Kenzie. Though, I'll admit, that's got a lot to do with Kenzie being so persistent and in-your-face about getting what she wants. I really do love her. She's funny, and always has something snarky to say no matter what kind of horrifying things she sees while hanging around Ethan. The cast of characters in The Lost Prince were amazing. I fell hard for everyone single of them. Especially Keirran and Razor. Keirran, oh, Keirran. I can't wait to see more of you in the sequel, The Traitor Son. And oh boy! The cameos. Yes. There are cameos made by original Iron Fey characters. And I squealed every time Ash or Puck or Meghan or Grimalkin stepped onto the page. And it was very interesting seeing how Ethan viewed all of these characters. He had very strong feelings about them. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but his hatred for a certain silver eyed faery made me giggle. If you noticed that this was more of a squealy rant than a review, that's because I loved this book so much I've lost the ability to form sentences. But, here, I'll try. The Lost Prince is a fantastic start to a new series in an already beloved world and lovers of the Iron Fey series and new readers alike will be swept away into the Nevernever alongside Ethan. Trust me, you don't want to miss this one!",Pretty In Fiction
9780373210572,"Engaging and enchanting, The Lost Prince is a much-welcomed revisit to the Nevernever. As someone who is a giddy fangirl for the Iron Fey series, I had high expectations for The Lost Prince. And I've promised myself over and again that I wouldn't read and compare this book to that fantastic series. It's not fair to the story and it's not fair to Ethan, because, really, NO ONE can compare to Ash. But I did. I compared Ethan's reluctant journey to Nevernever to Meghan's and I spent most of the opening chapters anticipating a reappearance of the beloved characters. When those characters actually did show up, I was beyond thrilled, which is awesome, but also not so awesome because I did miss them when they were gone. I wanted more of them, less of Ethan and his journey. But once I got over myself, I really enjoyed The Lost Prince! Ethan is not the sweet, lovable little boy we knew. He's almost grown now, and a life spent tormented by the fey has made him irritable, sullen, and aloof. Ethan is resentful of his sister, who left the family behind to become the Iron Queen, his parents just don't understand what he's going through. He doesn't want friends, or to be anyone's hero, but helping a bullied, half-fey schoolmate land Ethan exactly where he doesn't want to be: in the Fey's sights. Along with Kenzie, a beautiful, sweet girl who won't let Ethan push her away, Ethan travels through the one place he swore he'd never return to, reuniting with family and old acquaintances, and becomes the hero he never expected to be. Julie Kagawa's Fey world is by far my favorite. Her descriptive story-telling is highly visual, but not so heavy handed that it becomes boring or overwhelming. The action sequences are exhilarating, the dialogue is light and intense all at the same time. Her characters, whether you love them (Ash and Puck) or love to hate them (Leanansidhe) are always engaging. Wherever her next story leads, I will surely follow.",Andrea Thompson

9781907411021,"Favourite Quote: ""What's better, to be safe and suffer alone, or to risk pain and actually live?"" I have been wanting to read this book for a while, mainly because of the beautiful cover but the plot sounded really good. After much debate I've decided to rate this book a 4/5 stars! Let's start with the plot, in the beginning it felt very slow to me, and nothing much happened until over half way through but after that I was really fast pace and action packed! It was a little predictable but that didn't bother me. As for Amy Plum's take on angels, I really liked it, very unique and interesting. The main character Kate was okay, I thought she was sometimes immature and stubborn but overall she was fine, and Vincent was perfect, a bit too perfect but I easily overlooked that. Side characters were all great, I loved Charlotte, Ambrose and Jules they were awesome.! The reason that stopped me from giving this book a 4/5 stars was the insta-love. Yes, this book is full of it in my opinion, some people might disagree. I hate insta-love and I couldn't just ignore it so I took of a star. Overall I would recommend this book to everyone as I really enjoyed and cant wait for the next one! But be aware of the insta-love!",brookexx

Kate is extremely likeable and easy to relate to- you want her to find a little happiness from the beginning, and naturally, along comes Vincent and company. With death, revenance, heroism, love and loss this a book that all fans of good YA should read. http://eilishreads.blogspot.ie/",Eilish
9781907411021,"This book was exciting and so romantic! Paris!! Ooo la la! I'm one of those romantics that thinks it would be dreamy to visit Paris one day. Kate was sixteen, almost seventeen, and her sister Georgia was almost eighteen. Their parents died, and they moved from Brooklyn to live with their grandparents in Paris, France! Luckily, from summers of visiting Paris, they already knew French and the area. Plus, outgoing Georgia already had tons of friends. I enjoyed the sister dynamic. It was real. Kate and Georgia loved each other even though they fought sometimes and were complete opposites. I loved how they were always there for each other. Georgia was cute and spunky, a fun side character. Vincent was nineteen and completely charming. I also liked his guy friends Ambrose and Jules. They were fun and entertaining to have around. Charlotte was a sweetheart, and I hope to see her more in the next book. Revenants was a unique idea. I really enjoyed finding out all the rules to the revenant world. A revenant was basically someone who could die for others and come back to life. There's more to it of course so you'll have to read to find out. I highly recommend you check this book out.

9781907411021,"DIE FOR ME centres around a new concept of paranormal being, the revenants, whose existence is caused by nobility on the one hand and by hatred and anger on the other hand. We get to meet protagonists Kate and Vicent and their families.Our heroine is very likely, with a modest and caring character, our male protagonist can be described as a very gentle, understanding and sexy Frenchman. The relationship is really sweet , I am already eager to read more about them and how they are interacting together, always very cautious although there is not really a need to. I sense a love triangle emerging, which could hold some difficulties since the potential charmeur is also a good friend of Vincent. Set in Paris, DIE FOR ME takes us on a trip through the atmospheric and lovely capital of France. Amy Plum worked out a fantastic map of locations and settings by wandering the streets and sharing her favourite spots with her readers. Plum's writing is solid and entertaining. She doesn't bore her readers with dragging dialogues, but keeps them sweet and short. She involves some popular culture references which make DIE FOR ME also a youthful read. At some points DIE FOR ME was a bit slow paced, there are some moments with very few progress for the plot. But I see that DIE FOR ME as it is the first novel in a series is mostly to explain its concept of revenants and introduce its lovely characters. At the moment I cannot see where this story is heading, but that's exactly what makes it an exciting read. THE VERDICT This novel by debut author Amy Plum is like a box of petit fours filled with sweet romance and Parisian esprit, layered with dark enemies and finished with a tasty fantasy frosting. Hungry? Go get DIE FOR ME and give this new taste a try.",MissPageTurner
9781907411021,"This review is based on the audiobook. The synopsis is actually quite accurate, which is why I'm not going to summarize it myself. Instead I'm going to say something about the audiobook. I was extremely annoyed at the fake French accent that was used when pretty much anyone spoke (since the book takes place in France most people speak French ... or English with an accent). It was probably supposed to make it more interesting or something, but it just annoyed me. I'd have liked it better if it had been read in normal English. Like many other reviews have mentioned, the plot and the people are similar to Twilight. The heroine is slightly appalled at moving to another location, when she accidentally meets this so-hot-he's-sizzling guy who of course nearly immediately falls for her. She has a guardian that is no real guardian at all and older than she is (reading books 17-year-olds normally wouldn't even know about). Most of the family of Vincent of course likes her immdiately (like Charlotte and Jules, think Emmet and Alice in Twilight) while two are slightly reserved/mean (Charles and Jean Baptiste, or Jasper and Rosalie). So, yeah. Quite a few similarities. Amy Plum said though, that she wrote Die For Me after watching the movie to Twilight because she ""wanted more Edward"". That sure explains a lot. Still, while I don't like Twilight, I did like Die For Me. I like the original take on ... what Vincent is. And while I immediately recognized the villain for what he was (like ... the first time he was mentioned) it was still pretty intimidating. What I absolutely HATED was the exceptional things. Wow it's so rare this and that happens and then of course it happens to Kate and Vincent (also, I'm tired of plain first names). If this and that happens, the person usually dies but of course Kate doesn't. And of course Kate doesn't think she's beautiful when in turn she is so beautiful (apparently) that she turns heads. So yeah. I like the general idea. I like some of the characters (like Charlotte and Gaspard) but it's just too ... too much. Too similar to Twilight, too exceptional (weird thing to be) and too ... cheesy. I mean, Kate becomes depressive when she's without Vincent. That is neither healthy, nor interesting to read about.",Jill Barrakling
9781607066088,"U.S. War Department, 1940s Five physicists walk into a bar: a cannibal evil twin with multiple personality disorder, an alcoholic impostor from a parallel dimension, a pathological narcissist, an Italian alien and a floating skull with a plutonium-irradiated skeleton body. And one says: ??????C/??Hey, Mr. General, can we recruit nazi rocket scientists (while nuclear bombing the enemy and winning the war) in order to, incidentally, conquer space before being conquered ourselves by potential invaders from outer space???????C/?? And the General goes: ??????C/??Fine, but first you have to turn the corpse of the recently deceased president Roosevelt into an Artificial Intelligence while I deal with his orgiastic freemason successor.??????C/?? Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to THE MANHATTAN PROJECTS , by Jonathan Hickman! ____________________________________ Weird science, historical conspiracies larger than life, parallel dimensions, worlds colliding, races clashing in and out of our world??????C/???????| A story (inside History) of such absurd proportions could only have been written in comic form by one man: Jonathan Hickman. The writer is all the rage nowadays within the superhero scene because, after leaving behind a long lived and acclaimed run in the Fantastic Four , he was commissioned to take charge of the Avengers franchise with the start of the Marvel NOW! initiative. There he orchestrated Infinity which, last summer, was the most successful comic event of the publisher in recent years. But we??????C/??re not here today to talk about the more mainstream Hickman, but his devotion and consummate dedication to science-fiction in his indie projects: in Pax Romana (published as a complete author), the Vatican funded a military time-travel to the 4th century AD to strengthen the Roman Empire and avoid the Islam supremacy in the present; in Transhuman (with J. M. Ringuet), a mockumentary shows us a future in which humans are genetically engineered by rival companies seeking to manipulate the market with the excuse of building a better world; A Red Mass for Mars (with Ryan Bodenheim), facing a threat from outer space that promises to destroy humanity, recounts the last days of planet Earth; in The Red Wing (with Nick Pitarra) we return to a future in which fighter pilots not only master the air, but also time; and East of West (with Nick Dragotta) presents us with a sci-fi western in a dystopian future. It is not difficult to see a pattern: interest in evolution and the future, passion for conspiracies and the power of cults and religions, emphasis on probing the causes and consequences of the decline of human beings as the dominant species??????C/???????| always spiced with a seemingly unstoppable threat that accelerates the motivations of his characters and the plot itself. All this can be found, one way or another, in The Manhattan Projects . Accompanied again by the peculiar style of Nick Pitarra, a mix of realism and exaggeration (the ideal partner for Jonathan Hickman), an unkempt stroke with great attention to detail, cartoonish but overflowing with imagination, and all this, once again, colored by the always professional, and current star in her field, Jordie Bellaire. By their side, Hickman rewrites a History filled with each and every concern of his as a writer. In The Manhattan Projects , the great threat that acts as a catalyst of the story would obviously be World War II, although there??????C/??s a catch this time: under the guise of funding the Manhattan Project (singular; the atomic bombs that would end the war with Japan), those responsible for the nation??????C/??s defense put up a scientific program which, pluralizing the Project, will lead humans to discover what is ??????C/??out there??????C/??. So, what is the real catalyst? The Cold War, still in the shadows. The confirmation of extraterrestrial presence through the Tunguska event, in 1907, led the Soviet Union to be the first to make contact with aliens and build technology from what they found there. But the Americans had already discovered an interdimensional passage before the Roswell incident in 1947. The solution? A secret alliance to fight for the stars as the Cold War becomes a pantomime between politicians. Pure unadulterated Hickman. As you may have learned from my exposition, Hickman is very comfortable in both the genre and the subjects he brings to the table here, so if you knew previous works by the writer in this field, you can take them as reference. However, it is important to highlight a certain recoverable aspect of this book: beyond the ominous speeches and the ambience of pretended epic often featured in Jonathan Hickman??????C/??s works, what must be noted in The Manhattan Projects , as I wanted to imply in the introduction, is the fun and humor that permeate the entire book. Black, absurd, unintended??????C/???????| There is room for all kinds of humor without the story suffering for it at all, and sometimes even being reinforced. And this is because Hickman has created an absolutely brilliant roster of supporting characters, which are actually protagonists, since this is a completely choral book. Each and every one of them have (or will have) the time to shine, but perhaps in this first volume the one who does it more brightly is *Joseph* Robert Oppenheimer, given the personality (and I will say no more) the writer graces him with. In short, we face yet another work that is a worthy representative of the concerns and interests of its creator, Jonathan Hickman, so it may not be pleasing to those who do not connect with the writer. But The Manhattan Projects would be perhaps the most accessible and less convoluted of his proposals, unleashing pure and not-so-simple fun, full of B-movie sci-fi winks, and a humor so diverse that smiling is inevitable for any comics fan. Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnesses to Jonathan Hickman's most wholly satisfying work of recent times??????C/???????| And in the next volume: Franklin Delano Skynet!

She speaks of swallowing her spit and pretending it is soup, tightening her waistcloth to fool her belly into thinking it's full, and thickening her stew with dirt. Lakshmi dreams of going to the city like some girls and working for a rich family to send money back to her own relatives on the mountain. One day her stepfather returns home with a woman he says Lakshmi should call Auntie. He has made a deal for Auntie to take Lakshmi down the mountain to work. It seems her dream has come true, and her journey begins. Traveling down the Nepalese mountain and across the border into India is at once both exciting and frightening. Lakshmi, whose mountain life has been nothing but poverty and hard work, marvels at the sights and sounds of city life. Trains, buses, cars, and trucks amaze her. There are crowds of people and shops as far as the eye can see. Lakshmi arrives at her destination. She is told she will be working for a woman she is to call Auntie Mumtaz. Prepared to work hard and earn her keep, Lakshmi is shocked to discover what her real duties will be. She is thrust into the arms of an old man with onion breath. He kisses her and begins to demand the unthinkable. Terrified, Lakshmi runs. Auntie Mumtaz orders her capture and locks her in a room. After days of starvation, beatings, and cruel treatment, Lakshmi realizes she will need to cooperate to survive. Patricia McCormick uses a blunt and direct narrative style to present Lakshmi's horrific experiences.

It is quite a journey, but I could really feel where Caitlin, the main character, is coming from, why she made the decisions she did, and how an abusive relationship could develop. The relationship between Caitlin and her sister Cass is well done, and it is heartbreaking to read and feel with Caitlin when her sister leaves home. She is jealous of her, the seemingly perfect sister, but she loves her and they know each other really well. The story gets difficult when Caitlin decides to remake herself, and be what Cass was not. She joins cheerleading, which she hates, and then meets Rogerson, the mysterious hair boy. She falls in love with him, and gets past his walls. But he is abused, and then the abuse begins with Caitlin. She goes into this dreamlike state, and tries to deny what is happening to her, that it is not the real Rogerson that does these things to her, but as they happen more and more, she hides it while desperate to be found out. It really shows how someone abused can feel trapped, and not want to leave because they love the abuser, and often the abuser has a second side, who is sweet, smart, and loveable. Dessen's writing is beautiful, and leaves you wanting more.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780375838828,"Travel writers Phil and Ursula York of Boston, MA, the parents of timid twelve-year-old Henry, have been kidnapped while riding bicycles in Colombia, so Henry goes to Henry, KS, to live with his uncle and aunt, Frank and Dorothy (Dotty) Willis and his three cousins, Henrietta, Anastasia, and Penelope. He is given a bedroom in the attic and one night, after hearing some thumping and scratching, discovers that there are 100 cupboard doors under the plaster, which he proceeds to remove. Then he and Henrietta explore the doors which seem to open into other worlds, meeting several odd characters along the way like a boy named Richard Leeds, the strange little man Eli FitzFaeren, and the evil witch Nimiane. What will happen to Henry and Henrietta? Will they be able to get back home? And exactly who is Henry anyway? Author Nathan David Wilson, born in 1978, is the son of Reformed minister Douglas Wilson whose name is well known among homeschool circles as a proponent of classical Christian education. N. D. is a 1999 graduate of New Saint Andrews College, and holds a master's degree in liberal arts from St. John's College in Annapolis, MD (2001). He served as a part-time Lecturer at New Saint Andrews from 2001-2004, was promoted to Fellow of Literature in the fall of 2004, and still teaches as a professor of classical rhetoric part-time. Formerly he served as the managing editor for Credenda/Agenda magazine. His first children's novel was Leepike Ridge, an adventure story. 101 Cupboards is the opening book of the Henry York fantasy trilogy, followed by Dandelion Fire and The Chestnut King. Wilson has now begun a new series, ""The Ashtown Burials,"" which will be comprised of five novels beginning with The Dragon's Tooth and The Drowned Vault. Based on reviews, I was really looking forward to reading 101 Cupboards. Was I disappointed? No. Was I overwhelmed? Not necessarily. It was adequate, all right, okay, pretty good. The plot starts out a little slowly while the characters are introduced and the stage is set, but it builds up to plenty of action and excitement later on. There is little objectionable. I did note a couple of references to drinking beer. Certain creepy, magical elements, such as when Nimiane feeds off people's blood, might be a little frightening to some children on the younger end of the targeted reading level and those who are a bit sensitive. However, anyone who likes the bizarre and doesn't mind a bit of scariness should enjoy the book. A few loose ends are left at the close, but this opens the door (pun not originally intended, but it fits) for the sequels. I guess that I would like to read the other two books, but I really don't feel any mad rush to go out and get them immediately.",Wayne S. Walker

Even though he's stuck in a tiny converted closet up in the attic, Henry almost doesn't mind living with his relatives. In fact, he's kind of excited about it, because for the first time in his life, he can play baseball without a helmet, sit in the back of a truck, and own a knife of his very own (which his Uncle Frank bought for him). One night, while Henry's lying on his bed in the little attic closet, a piece of plaster falls off of the wall behind him and hits him in the head. With his cousin Henrietta's help, he rips down all of the plaster on that one side to discover an entire wall of mysterious cupboards. In one, they can see a glowing yellow room and a man's leg. From another, wind howls and rain pours into the room when the door is opened. Most of the cupboards are locked, but there is another mystery waiting in Grandfather's bedroom, which hasn't been opened since he passed away two years ago.

9781595145840,"Fantasy YA is just my thing - always has been and always will be! Needless to say that when I first heard about Falling Kingdoms I knew this was one I would NEED to read it because I was fairly confident that this book was pretty much written for me. I was right. Told from four POVs, with PLENTY of action, fight scenes, and bravery with just enough romance and intrigue. And for what it's worth, I think the Game of Thrones comparison is a fairly good one. Reasons to Read: 1. A rich, vibrant world: The best part about Falling Kingdoms is the setting, hands down. It's a requirement of mine that the fantasy books I read and love have devastatingly beautiful worlds created - this one was no exception. Each of the three countries stood out on their own, with their own beliefs, culture, and rules. And the interactions between them are vital to the story's progression. Seriously, I was swooning over the culture clash and political relations. (Can you tell I'm a huge nerd?) 2. Interlacing story lines: I'm typically hesitant when it comes to multiple storylines, but the characters here worked really well together and everything just blended so perfectly. It's a fantastic way to see the story from different perspectives, to really flesh out the problems and ideas without much bias. This means that the story is intricate and exciting, with something for every reader to appreciate! 3. A raw, gutsy sort of book: Falling Kingdoms definitely doesn't shy away from the uglier parts of life. Everything is so messed up and crazy, and it doesn't all work out perfectly. But it features strong characters who don't shy away from what they're afraid of or their losses. They stick it out and they're STRONGER because of that. I love reading about brave characters, ones who are able to find ways to survive and move on. Because that's something we all have to go through at some point. Fair warning: Falling Kingdoms is remarkable, in a devastating sort of way. The one thing I didn't love about the book stemmed from it's multiple story lines and 4 main characters. I thought it worked really well, for the most part, but there were definitely a few instances where it seemed like they could have benefited from a bit more personal development and time. A few things, including relationships with others, felt too rushed for my taste and I had a hard time being as impacted as I should by some of the events later on as a result of this. But this is definitely a series to watch out for and I'm really looking forward to Rebel Spring!

Written by three of the funniest women in YA, this collection of short stories chronicles the colourful life of Magnus Bane before the Shadowhunters. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard as I did while reading this amazing collection of hilarious short stories. Since the very beginning of my obsession with Cassandra Clare's Shadowhunters, Magnus Bane has been one of my favourite characters. I was always a little frustrated about the lack of back-story we're given about Magnus, so the second I heard these stories were going to be released, I was giddy. If you've ever read anything by Cassandra Clare, Maureen Johnson, or Sarah Rees Brennan, you know that every sentence any of them writes is bound to make you laugh and cry at the same time. Needless to say, I spent the entire novel in a fit of laughter. I'm so glad we got to see more of Magnus, and I definitely can't wait for The Dark Artifices!

9781595141712,"Wow. What an emotional read. Books that cover suicide--especially teenage suicide--can be tricky to navigate. But this book is done so well. It's such an honest well-rounded portrayal. There's no glamorization of Hannah's suicide (something I wanted to point because that's why I hadn't picked up the book sooner, misguided assumptions). The style of writing makes this book spectacular. It's a duel narrative, going back and forth between Hannah on the tapes and Clay in the present moment. It's so poignantly done. From Hannah's end, I became wrapped up in her emotions and deteriorating will. It was highly frustrating at times because I wanted to shake Hannah silly and say, these reasons aren't good enough to end your life. Stop this, please! And that's where Clay's narrative comes in. Clay is processing everything in the present moment, listening to the voice of the girl he liked explain why she killed herself. It's the most gut-wrenching kind of empathy to share with a character. I felt his pain. I felt his anger with Hannah. I felt his heartbreak in knowing she would never understand how much she had meant to Clay. His perspective constantly left me feeling like I had been punched in the gut. Getting both perspectives about the same memories and the same people is what made the story feel real and authentic. There's more than one perspective on everything, which is what this book captures so well. It might be a completely heart wrenching story, but it's so well done. Read it and find out yourself.",Ryann Dannelly
9781595141712,"4.5/5 Stars When I started reading this book I thought it would be about Hannah and her decision to commit suicide, and it is. More so, to me, it is Clay's story. This is about surviving a friend's death, understanding consequences when bystander intervention is absent and moving on. Asher has taken the time to highlight incidents that occur in most (if not all) high schools in the U.S. and abroad which further reaffirms issues of bullying in young people's lives. This book is also great for starting conversations with youth around bullying, social pressures, stress and suicide. I'll admit, when I finished this quick read I ventured over to Goodreads to mark it as ""read"" and read other reviews posted. I had a lot of mixed emotions and so I went for a walk... *Climbs onto soap box* Below are some of my random thoughts for processing: Suicide does not need a valid reason. What I mean by this, is even if Hannah's thirteen reasons feel petty, they weren't to her and that's the point. Every human handles stress differently. Any one of these thirteen reasons have been someone else's one reason. For some people it's one bad report card for another it may be year's of abuse, and for another it maybe a life long struggle with mental illness. All equally valid reasons and with equal loss. It's not your fault. Clay says this often as he listens to Hannah's stories. He tries to replay events in his head to see when he could've reached out to Hannah and Hannah experiences/witnesses several incidents of her own, all bad things but none of them their fault. It's not even the ""Baker Dozen's"" fault. We need bystander intervention training in schools/workplaces. You see this halfway play out in a scene with Justin and Bryce along with the effect of a failed intervention on Bryce's part. You also see this play out with Hannah and Jenny later on the same night. And you see plenty of characters stand by idly as things happen that should not. Hannah goes through great lengths in her tapes to explain why each of the situations are not acceptable and how they've built onto her snowball of non-escape. Move on. The last person Hannah calls out is Mr. Porter, her guidance counselor and English teacher. ""Move on"" is one of two choices he presents Hannah, which she uses as affirmation of her decision because she already knows that she cannot ""move on"". However, Clay uses the same advice to act as closure and spark a new hope. It's our ability to ""move on"" which allows each of us to wake up and start a new day. That doesn't mean forgive, forget, remain silent or become an activist. It simply means to finish today and begin tomorrow. Just move on. *Climbs off soap box* The book was fast paced, thrilling and a page turner. Asher exhibits a really interesting take on writing with multiple points-of-view. It took me a minute to sort out the voices in my head, but I really enjoyed not having to wait a whole chapter until I could get input from the other POV. I'm looking forward to more writing from Asher.",Meghann
9781595141712,"Ok I know what I'm about to say will seem harsh compared to the other reviews but this is how I felt, and I think people should be warned. It is perverted and disgusting, I only read 70 pages and was left feeling violated and sick in side. I DO NOT think it deserves the credit it gets, one of the reviews say something about being a great book for ""reluctant teens"" but if I didn't like to read and my parents gave me this to read, I would never want to read again. The point is it has a lot of inapropriate content, and it was not enjoyable. I felt sickened all over inside. I would skip this book. I mean I know that these things happen in real life, but I read for fun and enjoyment, not to be reminded of all the sick, twisted things you see on the news every night.",MisteryCat
9781595141712,"I can see why this book came so highly recommended. I would particularly point you in the direction of the audiobook for two reasons: One: The format of Hannah's suicide note is audio. Two: the twin narrators were phenomenally well-suited to their roles. Through the beauty of the audiobook version, it seemed like Clay and Hannah were, at times, having some kind of eerie, post-mortal conversation. This made the book so much more powerful as Clay's responses to Hannah's strange suicide note are so heartfelt and genuine that you have to wonder if he might have been able to help her, if only she had given him a real chance to do so. I really enjoyed the perspective of the male protagonist. It made a nice change in a category of literature which often has a lot of female perspectives. I suppose that we, as an audience, have to be able to see the chance that Hannah passed up on. The message to readers can then point out that there is always one chance of happiness left. We wouldn't want things to be too dismal now, would we? I was worried at first that, as we only get Clay's perspective on the matter, we might only see Hannah's suicidal proclivities as selfish. However, Asher and his protagonist explores perspectives on suicide and how people who try to get help can be seen as pathetic or ""trying to get attention"". Let's be fair, if you're trying that hard to get attention, then you might just need it. I listened to this audiobook while I was painting my bedroom, a job I had not been looking forward to! This is why I love audiobooks, they allow you to read while getting on with the necessary chores of life. This audiobook had me mesmerised from the get-go. I know my mum would tell me to stop reading books about such dismal subject matter ('Iya mam!) because she thinks they'll make me miserable. But I find that such books often deal so excellently with the tough subjects that they turn out to be quite life affirming! Thirteen Reasons Why had such wonderful characters, a great depth of emotion and, in the end, a rather lovely message.",Laura Williams
9781595141712,"I don't often write introductions to my reviews. In fact, the last time I can remember doing so was with the wonderful PUCKER by Melanie Gideon, which I read in 2006. However, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY, the debut novel from author Jay Asher, is the type of book that begs an introduction. So if you'd like to skip down to the third paragraph for the ""meat"" of the story, I won't hold it against you -- but you'll be missing something important. If you have the chance to only read one novel this year, THIRTEEN REASONS WHY should be that book. It's sad, amazing, heartbreaking, and hopeful, all at the same time. I dare you to read it and not become so immersed in the story that you lose track of time and your surroundings. You'll cry, several times, while reading this story. You'll have no choice but to think about your actions, and wonder what type of effect they have on other people. And, in the end, you might also find the need to say ""thank you."" Now, on to the story... When Clay Jensen finds a package on his front porch, he's excited. A package, for him? With no return address? What could it possibly be? What Clay finds is a shoebox full of cassette tapes, each marked as ""Cassette 1: Side A,"" ""Cassette 1: Side B,"" etc. Of course he rushes to the old radio/cassette player in his dad's garage to check out these mysterious tapes. And soon wishes, wholeheartedly, that he'd never picked up that stupid package from his front porch. What he hears when he inserts that first tape is the voice of Hannah Baker. Hannah, the girl he'd crushed on for longer than he could remember. The girl he went to school with. The girl he worked at the movie theater with. The girl who had changed, drastically, in the last several months. Hannah Baker, the girl who committed suicide. Clay soon realizes that these tapes aren't just a suicide note, aren't, really, even a clear-cut rendition of why she did what she did. Instead, these are thirteen reasons -- thirteen people, to be exact -- who created a snowball-effect of events that led Hannah to believe that suicide was her only option. But why is Clay on that list? How could he possibly be one of the reasons that she killed herself? As the day goes on, Clay becomes obsessed with listening to the tapes. And what he hears frightens him, disturbs him, and, in the end, leads him to realizations that he never would have expected. As Clay listens to the role that thirteen people, including himself, led in the ultimate death of Hannah Baker, his view of the world, and himself, changes drastically. You will love this book, because you won't be able to help yourself. You will feel what Clay feels. You will, in a very strong way, experience the highs and lows of Hannah's life right along with her. And there is nothing, in my opinion, that could speak better for the authenticity of a book. Read THIRTEEN REASONS WHY. And then, if you're like me, you'll read it again. And, hopefully, none of us will ever forget it. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781595141712,"I waited entirely too long to read this book. I'm not sure if it was the serious issues I could tell this book was about from the summary that made me hesitate, or if my TBR list was just growing too long or what? But I waited too long and I'm sorry for that. All I can say to those of you out there who haven't read Thirteen Reasons Why, is to go out right now and get yourself a copy and start reading. I'm in love with Jay Asher's writing. To be honest, I thought I was a part of this book. Not just reading the words and turning the pages, but I felt like I could hear Hannah's words for myself, and see the places on the map that Clay was visiting for myself. Asher is that talented, he takes you inside his writing and does not let go. As Clay listens to Hannah's story he decides he won't be able to take breaks or spread the stories out. It's almost like ripping off a band aid - you just have to get it over with. Not just so he can find out how he played a role in the grand scheme of things, but because he needs closure and the it's the type that can only come from knowing the whole story. I was right there with Clay, I couldn't stop reading, I just had to get the full story. This is not a light read, I found no humor within these pages and yet I couldn't, and didn't want to stop reading. Even now, I'm finished and yet still Hannah and Clay are with me. I think Thirteen Reasons Why will be sticking with me for a very long time. I'm not usually one for books with strong morals being forced on readers, or lectures about lessons to be learned, but this was different. Asher made me look at things in new ways and I'm not sure you can go back after something like that. I learned a valuable lesson from this book and I'm grateful for that. Clay says in the beginning of the book that he'll never be able to get Hannah's voice out of his head, and to be honest I don't think I will either. This story was amazing. It was emotional and heavy, but also moving and beyond memorable. I feel grateful to have read this book and cannot say nearly enough about how highly I think of Asher's writing and technique and his amazing gift for story telling. I may not be able to look back at this book and want to re-read it over and over again, it's just not that type of book. But I also can't bear to part with it. I'm not sure I'll ever read another that can even come close to being it's equal. I will never forget Hannah's story.",Katelyn

9780152061548,"If you're looking for one of the best books of 2006, then look no further than Susan Beth Pfeffer's LIFE AS WE KNEW IT. A wonderful tale of family love, loss, and survival, this is one story that will stay with you long after you've turned the last page. There have been lots of changes in sixteen-year-old Miranda's life recently. Her older brother, Matt, is away at college. Her mom is still adjusting to being a divorced parent. Her younger brother, Jonny, is obsessed with baseball. And her dad and his new wife, Lisa, are expecting a baby. Dealing with all of that has been quite stressful, but Miranda's been thinking about getting back into ice-skating, and she's spending plenty of time mooning over her current hero/crush, Olympic-hopeful Brandon Erlich, a hometown hero. Miranda's also excited about the meteor that's headed towards the Moon. Some scientists predict a minor collision; teachers predict plenty of extra homework dealing with the subjects of both Moon and meteors. For Miranda and her family, and for millions of others around the world, it simply sounds like a cool event you'll get to watch from your front yard through a pair of binoculars. What happens on that fateful night is something no one expected. The meteor does, in fact, collide with the Moon. However, the impact was stronger than anyone had previously thought possible, and immediately, all throughout planet Earth, the effects of that collision begin to be felt. Tides, which are controlled by the Moon, become erratic, causing deadly tidal waves. Fissures in the Earth's crust crack, causing earthquakes worldwide, even in places where no earthquakes had ever occurred before. Within twenty-four hours, it becomes apparent that thousands upon thousands of people have died, and that, with the Moon out of its normal orbit, many more deaths are sure to follow. This may sound like a depressing story, but in fact it's a story about hope and survival. LIFE AS WE KNEW IT follows Miranda and her family through nearly a year after the meteor's collision with the Moon, and all of the events that come after it--the power outages, the food shortages, the weather changes, and the loss of human contact. As Miranda and her family come to grips with this new way of living, their bodies and spirits will be tested more than they've ever been before. But this is ultimately a story about learning to survive with what you've got, and never taking what you have for granted. A wonderful, inspiring story, LIFE AS WE KNEW IT is one you'll want to read more than once. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

I honestly didn't think I would like it much, but it was recommend to me so I thought I would give it a try. It really was an amazing read. It's not slow at all and it kept me wanting to read more and more and more. The book is based around the mystery of Kylie and why she can do what she can do and I couldn't wait to find out all the secrets. In the end, I still didn't know and now I must read more of the series. The main character is a bit whiny at first, but she's written well and she gets better. She learns to deal with her issues and embrace the paranormal world and along the way make some really good friends.

9780312624675,"Review: Slowly getting through my long list of TBR, this one has been on my list for a long long while. I have had the book sitting on my shelf, I just never had the chance to fit in my schedule. Finally I did and I am very happy to have finally started this wonderfully talked about series. I really really liked this book. It was a bit slow in the pacing at times for me but there was a lot of building of relationships and laying of puzzle pieces to create a very mysterious paranormal story. Long Story Short: Kylie was in the wrong place and the wrong time and ended herself up in a heap of trouble. Kylie's parents believe that she needs some help dealing with their divorce and that is why she is acting out. They send her to a camp for troubled teens that Kylie's counselor recommended. In only takes a short bit before Kylie realizes she is in a camp for paranormal teens not troubled teens. She is told she herself must be a paranormal but Kylie is positive she is not. She would rather believe she is just nuts or has a brain tumor. What Kylie doesn't expect is to make some great friends, fall for two gorgeous boys, and undercover some dark deep family secrets. My Thoughts: This was wonderfully written story. I am so excited to start another paranormal story that has some of the great aspects of a paranormal read with a very fresh story line. The plot is only just started in this book and it seems to me that its only going to get better. I am happy that all the books are currently available and I can just keep on keeping on and read all about it. The story is definitely one worth reading. The pacing was a bit slow for me at times, but the author did a wonderful job of building the characters and the story. I am just a little bit ADD and when the pace slows I have a bit of a hard time with continuing. I am glad I did though. It really picked up towards the middle and the story went from good to great. So many secrets, so many stories, so many great characters. Every time I thought I had things figured out the story took another turn. It was great. The characters were pretty awesome. I liked the main character. She was in denial for most of the book but she was pretty level heeded, in fact that is probably why she was in so much denial. She was way to level headed to believe anything paranormal existed and she may be one of them on top of that. I also liked her roommates very much. I loved Della and Miranda, their constant bickering was a real comediac act. They were both really loyal characters. I love loyal characters. The love story wasn't the entire focus,which was good for me. I love romance in my books but I do get tired of them being the total focal point. It is still very important to the story and a big part of Kylie's new life but there was so much more going on. There was a bit of insta-love but not the oh my I can't live without you type of insta-love but the kind of insta-love that is clearly insta-attraction. There is a love triangle of course and argh when will these stop. I really don't think it was needed in this story but it's there and I do love both boys already. I know this triangle is going to break my heart one way or the other. Lucas is the brooding bad boy full of passion and Derek is the sweet can't resist you kind of boy. I really did fall for both of them. I am hoping there will be a clear winner for me later on in the books. In The End: It was a great read and I will for sure carry on with this series.",Jennifer McDaid

Trying to escape for free hours, she heads to a party which ends up getting police searched and everyone is arrested. Her mum has had enough and send Kylie to camp over the holidays only problem is this camp is full of supernatural weirdo's and all Kylie can think about is getting home to her normal life the only problem is could Kylie really be a supernatural to. When you start this book, the first thing that hits you is how much I loved Kylie's thoughts and feelings when she is feeling down she always seems to think something so funny you want to laugh your head off. Kylie is really confused with everything that's happening in her life, but I felt that really, deep down, she knew all along that something was not right. She was a great character that you could not help but love and her two roommates are brilliant they all worked really well together, which made the book really easy to get into. Now the story line was all about supernatrals trying to get along at camp but there were also lots of other things going on like Kylie finding out who she is and whether she can trust Lucas and Derek. Then there is the fact that someone at camp is really out to close the camp down your mind spends lots of time trying to work out who's doing it and which boy (Lucas or Derek) you like best and want Kylie to end up with which is really hard because I really loved both guys. The author gave you lots to think about and made the story easy and exciting to read. The ending for me was good it sorted out a lot of loss ends and keeps it well open for the next book in the series all together the book was well written it had lots of dark and light moments that made the book fresh and fun to read.

It started off slow as with most books; it's understandable since it's setting up for the sequel but the second half got more interesting. The characters were well shaped with their distinct personalities and they were fun and easy to relate with especially Miranda and Della, Kylies friends and also Holidays character; it had depth. I liked how all the characters were introduced and grew and progressed slowly. There is a balance in Kylies personality that I appreciate; it's realistic and believable. As with the boys, I still haven't decided which team I am on. Their characters need to grow more into three dimensional. Although I normally go with the ""bad boy"" character, for now I see myself leaning toward Derek. In my opinion, the author could have worked more on physical detail than explaining too much especially in Kylies case.",Shayla

9781442413344,"Where Things Come Back is such an unassuming little book. It's like that small, quiet kid in class other kids never even notice, but if they did, they'd see that he is well-read and fiercely intelligent and has a bright future ahead of him. In Lily, Arkansas, Cullen Witter is living his average life with his average parents and his not-so-average younger brother. He works at a grocery store, doesn't really understand girls and is generally pretty socially awkward. Then one day Cullen's brother Gabriel disappears without a trace and his whole life gets turned upside down. To add insult to injury, the people in Lily are more obsessed with a supposedly extinct woodpecker than with a missing sixteen-year-old. On the other side of the world, Benton Sage is having doubts about the nature of his mission in Africa. He feels that handing out food and a prayer isn't enough to save people. He wants to do God's work, and passing out food, water and Christ as quickly and efficiently as possible seems far too simple and not nearly enough. The two stories come together in a very unexpected way that is sure to take your breath away. Whaley has an amazing talent for telling extremely dramatic stories in a decidedly non-dramatic way. Throughout the book, Cullen seems oddly detached, almost unfeeling, but even when you catch glimpses of his emotions, they're not outbursts but rather quiet confessions from a character who would much rather remain unnoticed. This character, and most Whaley's characters, really, are amazing in their simplicity and all of them are unique, from desperate mothers to religious fanatics. Although it won both the William C. Morris Award and the Michael L. Printz Award, Where Things Come Back is not for everyone. It has the feel of a classic and I'm certain it's on its way to become one, but like all classics, it requires a certain amount of patience and trust in its author.

9781595144737,"First off - why did nobody tell me I would need book two on hand for when I finished this one? because OMG I do. I knew I would like this book going in because a) it's in the VA world and b) Adrian. I was right, I liked it, a lot. I don't like the alchemists but I do like Sydney, she may be uptight and a little bigoted but this book shows how she has grown since we first met her and that she has potential for much more growth. Oh and Adrian, I have loved him since he was first introduced in Frostbite and I love that we get to see a new, deeper side to him here. I think Sydney is going to be really good for him, if they get romantically involved or not. I enjoyed the little mysteries that Sydney sets out to solve, they add more to the main plot of protecting Jill and life in a private high school. I did not see the bad guy reveal coming, I was very surprised I like how Richelle deals with real life problems within the unreal world of vampires and magic - aside from daily issues of fitting in, making friends, finding love and finding out who you are, she deals with tougher issues of depression, self harm and body image. Sydney thinks that she is fat and frumpy, even though she is at size 4 called a twig and skinny a few times. This dysmorphia not only stems from being around naturally slim Moroi and athletic Dhamphirs but also from her fathers stinging remarks on her appearance. Hopefully, we will get to see Sydney come to accept that she is beautiful just the way she is.

However, there is another story tell and not everyone has had their happily ever afters, so now it is Sydney's turn. I remember her very well from the original story and I always thought she had a very original voice compared to many of the other characters in the series. Her distaste for vampires in the beginning is really what captured my interest. She grows to perhaps understand them but she still has a hard time being friendly with them because of her upbringing and the culture of the Alchemists. This book brings back characters such as Jill, Adrian, and Eddie as well. I love the growth that each character faces throughout Bloodlines, while staying true to their original nature. Richelle Mead's writing style brings to life a new world and I loved it! aEURA'"" Sydney, a girl those who have read the Vampire Academy series are familiar with, has always been loyal to those she cares about and from the beginning, she displays this characteristic from the first page. Not only is she still under punishment for her actions during the original books, no one believes they can trust her because she has become essentially a vampire lover according to their beliefs. When she accepts the job to assist in the protection of Jill, I think she still struggles with the initial disgust that she feels toward vampires. It will always be somewhat ingrained in her nature no matter how much she attempts to desensitize herself to it. I loved how easily she manages to take over the role of main character and carries the weight of a complex series that had Richelle Mead not done it, I would not have believed she would be able to handle it. This character brings to life the world of Vampire Academy in a way I never would have anticipated and yet, I love it. aEURA'"" Sometimes spin off series don't work but this one definitely does. aEURA'"" Jill has come into her own in this book. She continues to struggle with her identity after the shock of the finale for VA and she continues to struggle with the concept that she is anything but Jill. Her life has become tied to Adrian's much like Rose was tied to Lissa, which only proves to complicate matters further for the young Dragomir. It's hard not to love and feel bad for her after the story begins. This young woman has grown up a lot since she first was introduced to the VA series. I love, however, how naive she still proves to be, especially in the boy area and she takes to the whole romance thing quite easily unlike Sydney who would rather run from attractive men. aEURA'"" Poor, brooding Adrian still suffers from the emotional blow that he was handed at the end of VA and struggles to maintain his ""I don't care"" attitude. I think in this story, he truly comes into his own as his real aspirations come to the surface with Sydney's encouragement. He wants to be more than he is and move beyond the person who he once was - the one that apparently wasn't good enough for Rose. I've always adore Adrian with his attitude that always appears to be a facade and I love him more in this book than the original ones. And all I need to say about Eddie is that he is adorable. aEURA'"" I love the writer and I love the book. It works somewhat like a stand alone and is the perfect continuation of the Vampire Academy series for those who can't seem to let it go... like, well, me.",Bailee Christiansen
9781907411038,"Favourite Quote: ""It's not a weakness to be traumatised by death."" The first novel in this trilogy, I really liked! And this is one, I'm having mixed feelings! I'm torn between giving this a 3.5 stars and 4 stars! I think I'll just round it up anyway to 4 but in truth my rating is between the two! One of the reasons I took a star off was the plot, I felt it there was too much information given, pretty much the entire plot was all about the information and no a lot of action until the last couple of chapters! So at parts I found it to be quite boring and I was forcing myself through the chapters! However as I said, the ending was really good and completely unexpected to me! The characters I did really like throughout the book! The main character Kate was much more badass than the first novel which I liked and she wasn't living in daydreams, she knew the reality of what her and Vincent's relationship was! That made me love her even more! As for Vincent, I swear he's the most perfect boyfriend ever, just love him! All the other characters Ambrose, Jules etc were all amazing! Though I wish Charlotte was in the novel more cause I really liked her! Another reason why I was conflicted about this book was the hints of a possible love triangle forming and I just LOATHE love triangles!

We fell in love with Die for Me, and we were expecting the same from Until I Die. And let us tell you something, we were absolutely right. Until I Die was an exciting, magnificent, stunning and breathtaking book. Until I Die has all we want in a book; it'll make you laugh, fall in love (especially with Jules *Jules team rock*), cry and scream. And all at the same time. In the second book of the Revenants series, Vincent promises Kate that he'll resist his desire to die. In order to accomplish his vow, he has to do some dangerous things that will bring him a tremendous suffering. Charles has failed saving a children's life and exposed himself and his kindred to the numas. As a consequence, now he and his twin Charlotte have to move to other place and new revenants will take their place in JB's (Jean-Baptiste) mansion. This replace are a couple of old and wise Revenants. But wait...the Revenants have something gross going on. They'll have to face an evil bigger than what they've seen in their lives. Someone of their closest circle will betray them, put everyone they love at risk and cause enumerable suffering. We really love this book, even though we wish things had gone a little different, but just a little. So if you are one of those person who think ""Ok, I've read the first one and ended happily ever after...and I don't want to ruin my little fantasy, so I won't read the other ones"" let us tell you that if you do not read Until I Die, you will regret it. It is fantastic book that, probably will make you be on the edge of your chair all the way through it, but we can assure you that you would be satisfied with the result. We really hope that you follow our advise, and that is why we will leave you one of our favorites quotes from Until I Die. ""Kate, I admit that we aren't in the easiest of situations. But are you always this . . . complicated?"" I opened my mouth to say something, but Vincent shook his head, grinning. ""Actually, don't answer that. Of course you are. I wouldn't be so totally into you if you weren't."" We really loved this book, we wish we can write a lot more than we have done, but we though you wouldn't like to be spoiled, or would you? Because if that's the case...go ahead, tell us! We would be SO happy to do it! *giggling*. ****POST NOT FINISHED.

9781442483729,"The Infernal Devices is a prequel series to The Mortal Instruments, with many fans (unsurprisingly) loving it even more than the original series. The first book in the series is Clockwork Angel, the second Clockwork Prince and finally, Clockwork Princess. The series is set in Victorian era London and offers a unique twist on an already interesting time. The books focuses on a young american woman named Tessa Grey who is forced to leave her home to sail for England. She is unwittingly drawn into a supernatural world filled with demons, warlocks and things she never could've guessed existed, though as she soon finds out, she more than fits in. She is taken in by the Shadowhunters of the London Institute who help her acclimatise to her new found identity (or lack there of). The series is certainly suspense-filled; it seems everyone has their secrets to keep and difficult choices to make, many of which are life-alteringly huge! The characters in the series are fantastically developed and their intricately entangled lives make for some heart-wrenching conflicts of interest (Wessa/Jessa/Heronstairs anyone?) that make it nigh on impossible not to become totally engrossed in their story. There are some incredibly poignant moments throughout the books, some particularly painful aspects include Will Herondale's struggle with his curse and the consequences it bears on his life, Nate's betrayal of Tessa, the breaking of the parabatai bound, Jem Carstair's illness and deterioration and above all the controversial ending to the series! (*tear*). Though there are many serious and somber times in the series, there's no denying that there's also a huge amount of genuinely funny moments, many courtesy of Will, that lift the books and keeps them from being too heavy on the heart. It's clear that Cassandra Clare is a truly great author and The Infernal Devices showcase her talents beautifully. She has the rare ability to create complex and developed characters in an equally complex and elaborate world. Her writing is intense, action-packed and completely engaging. My favourite book of the series is probably Clockwork Princess, though it is most definitely also the saddest of the trilogy. One of my favourite series, I would highly recommend this to anybody (if you think you can handle the heartbreak!) If you would like to see more please visit http://eilishreads.blogspot.ie/",Eilish
9780375838842,"Only a couple of weeks have passed since Henry York and his cousin, Henrietta, had their adventure in the mysterious cupboards adorning the wall of Henry's attic room. Since he'd come to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousins in Kansas, Henry discovered the hidden wall of cupboards accidentally, and learned that each one leads to a different time and place. Built by their grandfather, who listed the combinations to the different worlds in his journal, the cupboards can only be traveled through via the large cupboard in Grandfather's room, which had been locked tight until the battle with the witch of Endor. Henry's aunt and uncle receive a letter from his parent's lawyer saying that Henry must return to Boston in two weeks. Henry can't stand the thought of going back, especially now that he might have more of a history in one of the cupboard worlds than he'd ever imagined, and he grows desperate to escape through the door to Badon Hill, which calls to him in his dreams. Henrietta, who'd stolen the key to Grandfather's bedroom so that she could explore the cupboards on her own, finally relents, and she and Henry go behind the barn to retrieve the key. While Henry keeps watch in the growing storm and Henrietta digs, he spots a curious dandelion that appears to glow. Reaching for it, Henry sees a flash of light and is knocked unconscious, with only a dandelion shaped burn on his hand to indicate what happened. After a stranger visits him in his dreams, and he awakens blind, Henry knows that he must escape into the cupboards to find a better explanation of what's happening to him. Unfortunately, less compassionate forces are already interested in his growing abilities... I must admit that I liked this book much better than its forerunner, 100 CUPBOARDS, if only for the fact that I felt much more involved with the characters and that we find out more about the history of the cupboards. Everything comes together in this volume, and, taken as a whole, this original concept makes for an interesting, action-filled story that will keep horror and fantasy lovers on their toes.",TeensReadToo
9781401237127,"Red Hood is intriguing to me, as I had never heard of the character before I started the new 52. I've read the whole ""Death of a Family"" arc and the Red Hood volume was good enough that I had to backtrack and find out more about him. Of course throughout all my DC reading he's popped up here and there but only very briefly. Roy Harper has made a few brief pre-Arsenal appearances as well. This volume has great dialogue and is very comedic. If you love banter among JL team members, there is a great deal of that going on here and it really made me like both Roy and Jason. Princess K we don't get to know very well but she's very powerful and everything mentioned about her past is very intriguing. Lots of action in this volume as we have a couple of side stories going on but the main theme centres on the new ""team"" tracking down the ""Untitled"" and finishing off the remaining members. A lot of Jason's background with the ""All"" is explored and I feel much more familiar with the character now. Interesting tidbit shows Nightwing's old blue costume having been left aboard Starfire's hideaway when Jason first finds her.",Nicola Mansfield

9780312551513,"I often read books, which are translated from english to german. This time I did it vice versa. The original book is called ""Rubinrot"" and it's a german one. I already read the original. The cover looks nice. You can see a beautiful girl in a red dress in front of London. The story takes place in London. The title sounds nice, even if it's described in too much words. Gwyneth is the protagonist of the story. She's 16 years old and seems to be a ""normal"" teenager. Her best friend is Leslie. She lives with her whole family in a big house in London. And everyone thinks her annoying cousin Charlotte has the gene to travel back in time. The content is great and it has much action. Travelling in the time sounds very interesting. What if you'd have been in 1933 for a while ? To be in france while the french revolution takes place ? It sounds really cool - but the first travel in time was a big shock for Gwyneth. I love the way Kerstin Gier writes. It's always some kind of funny. All in all, I loved the book and I'm waiting to read Sapphire Blue (hopefully soon) and Emerald Green.",Lia

Grace wanted to be sure Amy and Dan could take part in the hunt, as they needed a chaperon. All this time, Nellie's been reporting back to Mr. McIntyre. Amy and Dan can't believe what they're hearing. How could they have trusted her? Now, they realize that they can't trust anybody, except themselves. While in Jamaica, they find a significant piece of a clue. With a little bit of research, they uncover knowledge of pirates with Cahill loot. Directly after their research find, Nellie's forced to visit a woman who wants to speak with her. Nellie and her charges are in for a shock. Grace influenced her life in ways she never imagined - more than just hand-picking her as Amy and Dan's au pair. With this new knowledge, will Amy and Dan trust Nellie again? They're running out of people to trust, and as they get closer to the truth behind the 39 clues, the danger keeps escalating. Without her help, they might end up dead, but would trusting her be more dangerous? I love this series. These are quick, engaging reads that I devour.

The art is the same good stuff and manages to impart a tangible sense of danger.

9781250012890,"I started this series when it came out, and I have followed it since, it is sad to know that my time with these characters has come to a close, but I am happy for them to get their ending. C.C. Hunter doesn't disappoint. This gets right into the action and into the thick of things. Kylie has a lot of hard choices to make and it doesn't really ever give her a chance to rest and figure things out. After all, evil villians don't like to do that, they only make speeches to give you a chance to figure out how to beat them after all, lol. Derek and Lucas are at the forefront, and as usual, I am so torn, but after the heartache in the last one, I don't know if that was actually closing his part or if its just leading to a more epic ending. They both have great things going for them and so sad to have to have one of their hearts shattered along with a piece of mine. But as the book went on, I knew the right choice for her, and totally agreed with it. It was the best possible ending to a love triangle like this, and I didn't know how Ms Hunter would do it, but she gave me the romantic HEA for them that I wanted. As usual, the secondary characters are amazing. I love the bantering between Miranda and Della, and I am super excited to hear that Della will be the star in her very on spin off story. Holiday and Burnett are amazing too, and I love where she took them. The rolling on the floor laughing humor is still in place, and there were several places that had me in stitches and my husband giving me that look and asking if the book needed to be taken away. Then I gave him my look and all was good. The series ended beautifully, I feel like I got the resolution I wanted, I saw tremendous growth in Kylie. The romance was hot and tension filled. Bottom Line: Great ending to awesome series.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781907410178,"I loved this book. I literally devoured it from start to finish in just a couple of sittings (well one sitting broken up only by having to work and get just a little sleep). Its set in the same world as most of Kelley Armstrong's books and having read both the women of the Otherworld series and Darkest Powers series, entering May's world, a little medical research town in a larger world where names like St Cloud and Dr Davidoff (among others) have some significance from previous novels, was like visiting one of those favourite vacation spots that you like to go to once in a while, forget about the where you normally live and catch up on what been happening since youlast visited and discover some new places there to explore. In The Gathering, the first novel of the Darkness Rising series, we meet Maya, a regular teenager living in a small town, adopted but happy with her lot and not overly curious about where she came from. From the beginning I connected with Maya. She is strong and comfortable in who she is and her place in the world. She is still getting over the drowning of her best friend but this hasn't stopped her from continuing to tackle the world arond her and get on with life. Now any veteran of Armstrong's books will have a fair idea of at least part of what Maya's birthmark means but Armstrong, who is using this book also a a set up for a new trilogy (series?) creates a story that leaves even the veterans with more questions than answers. While part fo the mystery might be solved in this book, that also gives the reader more questions than answers and the ending leavves the reader gasping for more. I most definitely recommend this book to both the avid Kelley Armstrong fan and those who are newer to her books as while there are titbits there for the veterans, they are not necessary to know to still enjoy the story being told and as always its an awesome story. I have no hesitation giving this book 5 stars.",Nikk Karlovsky
9780142407387,"Before you read the review of ARK ANGEL, you need to take into account that this is the sixth book in the engaging, entertaining, action-packed adventure series starring Alex Rider. If you haven't read the first five books in the series, you'll probably want to do that before you pick up ARK ANGEL. Although it can stand on its own, you'll feel more in the loop by reading the previous books first. ARK ANGEL picks up immediately where SCORPIA, book five, left off. At the end of that book, we saw Alex Rider on the ground, wounded by a sniper's bullet. For those who thought that Anthony Horowitz was planning to kill off our favorite young MI6 agent, please be assured that ARK ANGEL does not in any way imply dead. Alex is alive and relatively well, recuperating in an exclusive private hospital in London. The sniper's bullet missed his heart, instead bouncing off a rib and exiting out his arm. Now, as he's recovering in posh room nine of the hospital, he becomes friends with Paul. The same Paul that turns out to be the son of Nikolai Drevin, one of the richest men in the world. When Alex saves Paul during a kidnapping attempt, Nikolai invites Alex to finish his recuperation at his estate. Alex soon wonders at the wisdom of being in Drevin's company, however, when he learns that an eco-terrorist group known as Force Three has threatened not only the Drevin family, but the safety of the entire world. Nikolai Drevin's latest project, Ark Angel, is in full swing. Designed to become the first ultimate luxury hotel in outer space, it contains everything the world's richest people could want. It's also, at least according to Force Three, a threat to the environment of Earth as we know it. Now the members of the terrorist group are out to stop Ark Angel from ever opening, and they'll do anything--and everything--they can to see their mission come to completion. Even if it means hurtling the hotel back through the atmosphere and onto Earth's surface. ARK ANGEL is another action-adventure read that will keep you turning pages right through to the end. Alex Rider has come a long way since the fourteen-year old boy roped into complying with MI6, but there's part of him that's still determined to leave the spy organization for good. Yet he knows that his skills are needed, and the unending action of ARK ANGEL show in detail why that is. You won't go wrong with any of the books in the Alex Rider series.",TeensReadToo
9781848452213,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Harlequin (UK) Limited and Netgalley.) This is the second book in the 'Healer' series, and kicks off where book 1 'Touch of Power' left off. **Warning - some unavoidable spoilers for book 1 'Touch of Power'** Following her healing by the peace lily, Avry decides that the best thing for her to do is to allow her enemies to believe her dead, so that she may work under cover. Leaving Kerrick, even though they have only just admitted their feelings for one another, Avry travels back to 'Mom' (who we met in the first book) who helps her with a disguise. Avry then infiltrates the army, and begins teaching them Kerrick's tricks for moving through the forest unheard. Avry's plan is to not only aid the army against Tohon's army (and zombies - which they don't believe her about), but also to try and reconnect with her sister Noelle (who tried to kill her in book 1 - slightly nuts). Kerrick on the other hand travels home (I think?) to give people the news that Avry is dead and rally his own army, but gets ambushed by some large zombie ufas on the way and then gets jumped by the person leading the ufas - Cellina, but she lets him go and lies to the king that the ufas killed him (not sure why she does this). Now Avry is intent on stopping Tohon's zombies, and figuring out exactly what he has been doing with the death lilies. But how long will her disguise fool people for? How will Avry react to the news that Kerrick is dead? And will they triumph against Tohon's armies? This book confused the hell out of me, and the last two lines were an absolute killer! I really liked the first book in this series, I often have problems keeping up with the storyline in fantasy novels, but I didn't really get that with the first book. It seems that all the confusion was being stored up for this book though! It's not even that long since I read the first book, it's only about 5 weeks, and I still got confused! Avry basically wants people to think that she's dead so that they're not looking for her and trying to kill her - good plan if you ask me. What I didn't really get was why she was so intent on making up with her sister when the last time she saw her she tried to kill her! I mean, why not just leave well alone? Especially when you're trying to not get killed, and the woman your sister works for is also trying to kill you! Anyway, Avry can't possibly just go into hiding or something, so instead she finds the army, talks her way in, and then begins training them to walk quietly. I sort-of understood that part, but Kerrick's journey? Not a clue I'm afraid. He got attacked by some zombie ufas, and the girl controlling them (Cellina) took his sword and told king Tohon that the ufas had killed him. What happened to him after this? I don't know, I got seriously confused. Why did Cellina cover for him? Not sure on that one either. Who were the other people he ended up running into and helping? Not a clue. Anyway, there were parts that I understood and liked! I kinda liked the way King Tohon managed to turn Avry on just by touching her, I liked how once again the lilies and their venom was a key part of the story, and I liked how Avry and Kerrick eventually found their way back to each other. The storyline overall was a bit bland though, and in my opinion this book had a serious case of middle book syndrome, it seems that even Avry can't cure that. The ending though? Oh my! This bland, confusing story hit us with one hell of an ending. Ms Snyder - those final 2 sentences made me want to scream!!! 'No!' How can you do that?! To Avry and to us?! Let's just say that those final 2 lines had more impact on me than the entirety of the second book, and now I might have to read book 3! Overall; a fantasy story that was unfortunately a little bland and difficult to get through, with a major cliff-hanger at the end. 6 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780765328670,"Favourite Quote: ""They rationalised their fears away. People shouldn't do that."" I've heard some many good things about this book that I just had to pick it up. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed, and I give this book a 3/5 stars. The beginning of the book was awesome, I loved it and that lead me to believe the rest of the book would be the same. However when it got towards the middle, the story just started to feel bland and was very average. It did pick up about towards the end but not enough to award a higher rating. The plot its self was okay, it was an interesting concept but it was very predictable and not in the slighest scary (like some reviews I've seen). The writing for me was simple and I think that annoyed me a bit. As for the character's Cas was strong, intelligent, witty and just a great character...up until the middle when he met Anna and he became a sap! Anna was boring character, she was like a stone. Plus I wasn't really a fan of their romance. Other side characters were okay, not really worth remembering. Overall this book was okay, not the best or worst I've read. As for the next book in the series, I don't know if I will be picking it up.",brookexx
9780545259088,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) I've been dying to read this since I finished Linger. I won my copy from Ashley (from What's Your Story?) not long after it came out, and even though I wanted to read it as soon as it came in the mail, I was afraid to! I didn't want this trilogy to end. I didn't want to say goodbye to Grace and Sam. This is one of my top favorite young adult series. Even though I'm happy with how Forever ended, I still wish there were another book in the series. I'd love to know what happens after this. After everything they've went to with their relationship and the wolves. This series is so beautifully written, and so beautifully described and so real, that I just didn't want this to end. I cried so hard after I read the last line and realized there wasn't another chapter. I could of swore there was! Maggie is a fantastic author, I will definitely be getting my hands on her other books as soon as possible. I really need to catch up and read The Scorpio Races. I'm so inspired by her writing. It both inspires me, AND makes me want to chuck all my writing and curl into a ball. Her descriptions are amazing and just so..poetic. Her writing truly is beautiful. At least what I've read of it. The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy is. I'm not going to say much about anything with this book because it's the last in a trilogy and I don't want to give away any spoilers to those who decide to read this review before starting the series. So I'm just going to say that the characters are amazing. Even those who annoy you. Cole annoyed me so bad in Linger, but I loved him. I'm glad I got to learn more about him and read more from his point-of-view in this one. Also, Isabel. =) She really made me mad in the first book half the time, but she's become on of my favorite characters. And you can't forget about Sam. Oh, Sam. He's definitely my number one favorite. He's so sweet and caring and he'd rather take care of others, even Cole, than do things for himself. Things to make himself happy. He's definitely one of my top YA dream guys. *le sigh* Overall, I'm sad it's over, but it was a really good book. I'm going to miss this world. If you haven't read the series yet, or you have read the first two books, but not Forever. READ THEM/IT! Now! It's a great series and the writing is beautiful. Maggie is definitely an idol of mine.",Amanda
9780545259088,"The POV's alternate between Grace, Sam, Cole, Isabel and a surprise voice who opens the story of FOREVER. I can't say which character captured me most. They all had something about them which made me love them even more, as individuals and as part of the various relationships. I like them all so much, but I must say that I was mostly craving for more Cole, this man is really an addiction. Sam and Grace, Isabel and Cole are so great together. Still I wished for more moments between Cole and Isabel. Their scenes always ended when they were at their highest. Poetry is not my favourite type of text, still Sam's reciting make the novel an even stronger part of the series. Sam's beautiful texts, whispered words and sung lyrics always made me go all fan girl. In duet with Cole, these two boys are definitely my favourite fictional band. The story around the teens and wolves feels so natural and although sad things are happening Maggie's writing feels comforting and just right. Her describing the wolves, their interactions and wolfish voices felt real. She puts words together and somehow they form this beautiful mass of something that makes sense and affects you. The ending left me with mixed feelings. It was the final to a much-loved series and I felt gratitude towards Maggie for creating the world of the Mercy Falls wolves. Then it left me utterly disappointed at the same time. I never considered Maggie as a writer of stereotypical happily ever afters, but I hoped for a different last sentence, maybe even last few chapters. It was just so unsure, open and very sad (which is of course a more than acceptable feeling to evoke after the incidents of FOREVER). I just wish the open end as I see it, leaves room for another book in the series (despite Maggie's goodbyes). THE VERDICT FOREVER has so many awesome swoon-worthy and fantastic emotional moments. I didn't want the story to come to an end!",MissPageTurner
9780545259088,"Wow... what a fabulous book! Maggie has really gone all out with this one. Forever is the last book in the Wolves Of Mercy Falls series and what an ending it was. The Story has followed the lives of Grace Brisbane, Sam Roth, Isabel Culpeper and Cole St. Clair. It's a book on the werewolves survival and some nice passion and love come along with it. The character Grace, started out when she was attacked as a child and was saved by one particular wolf, which was Sam. It was one of those love at first site things and that is where their love story begins. Then Isabel comes into the mix, when he brother gets bitten by another werewolf and she soon finds the truth, but also swears to help and protect their secrets but in doing so, she does lose her brother along the way. It's around the second book that Cole comes into the story, but he certainly makes an impact. Beck, Sam's adoptive father changed Cole when he was dying, promising a new life and he agreed. But it is a lot harder for Cole to fit in because a lot of people recognize him from the famous band Narkotika. In the end of linger Sam has finally been able to stop shifting but in return the love of his life Grace has finally shifted herself and it seems that Sam can't get a happy ending but he still does not give up. Now in Forever, Sam, Cole and Isabel fight hard to save not only Grace but the rest of the wolves from being hunted. The people of Mercy Falls have decided to many killings have happened and they remove the wolves from the protected list and go on a hunting spree. Sam tries desperately to save the wolves and the ones he loves, while the police try and pin the murders and disappearances on him. The book has so much to tell and not even words can describe the action and the emotions you go through in this book. The suspense keeps you one the edge of your chair right till the very end or the last page in the book. But in the end it comes down to one thing.... Kill or be killed. There is one hero in this story and they certainly know how to go out with a bang. The ending is also quite sad because we do lose a beloved character and it certainly makes you want to cry. At the very end of the book, you will be sad but angry at the ending, I know I certainly was. Maggie has ended the series with an opening for more, but as Maggie has said before, this will be the last book to the series, no matter how much we might not like it. But we can always hope for a spin-off series. Maggie has really won our hearts with this dramatic love story and it will be a series that is remembered and treasured for a very long time to come.",Perri Maddox
9780545259088,"NOTE: You need to read the first two books in this series, SHIVER and LINGER, before you read FOREVER, in order to understand the story. The tables have turned. Now, Sam is the one waiting. Even though waiting for Grace to return to human form is torture, it is nothing compared to the agony he feels when he thinks about the danger she is in while running loose in the woods. Mr. Culpeper has wanted the wolves in Mercy Falls dead ever since his son was killed by them. After a girl is found torn apart in the woods, Culpeper has just the ammunition he needs to get his wish. While Grace is Sam's priority, he also has the added responsibility of saving Beck and all of the other wolves. Sam and Grace attempt to come up with a plan, while Cole St. Clair, ex-lead singer of NARKOTIKA and newest pack member, takes dangerous measures to find a cure for the disease infecting his pseudo-family. With the help of Isabel Culpeper and a very unlikely ally, the wolves finally have some hope. FOREVER has it all - heartwarming romance, angry teen rebellion, and dry, witty humor. It made me laugh, cry, and stress in all the right amounts. FOREVER is the final book in the WOLVES OF MERCY FALLS trilogy. It provides the reader a satisfying ending, while still leaving enough room for us to wonder about the future of the pack. Maggie Stiefvater has given readers a wonderful story in this trilogy. If you haven't read them yet, run, run, run to the store and get them today.",TeensReadToo
9780545259088,"I'm still not sure what I thought. I flew through it and I am relieved to know how the characters I've invested time and emotion into turned out... but the ending really didn't feel complete to me. I read it several times, but I am still not sure exactly what happened and what exactly the goodbye is for.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780545259088,"I absolutely love this trilogy. Maggie has such a unique writing style in all her books. She draws you in from the first page and doesn't let go. The characters are so real it's like you are really friends with them and are there throughout the book. Sometimes I forget that they are supernatural beings and not entirely human. They deal with everyday issues along with their lives as wolves. I have loved Grace and Sam since the beginning in Shiver. That was the start of such an amazing trilogy that I could not get enough of. While they are still teenagers their love has been tested so many times and has just continued to grow stronger. I liked how when they first met and it was all teenage love, boy meet girl. Then it evolved into something so much bigger. Their struggles with friends, family and each being a wolf just brought more to the story. Then add in Isabel and Cole and the story gets even more interesting. I thought Maggie did such a great job with these two characters. I loved their whole love/hate relationship. How they came together to save Sam, Grace and the wolves was truly spectacular. I liked how Isabel and Cole's family science background was brought in without it sounding all scientific. It was really interesting and I'm not into science at all. I was surprised and sad that some of the characters did not make it to the end. The part with Sam and Beck was well written, not going to give away any spoilers though. I was really shocked and was wondering the entire time about the Sheriff. I kept thinking he is just setting them up but happy how that turned out. I also liked how Cole was able to communicate with the wolves while he was human. That was an added bonus. There were just so many moments that I could list that I loved throughout this book and the previous ones. I have read and own all the books Maggie has published, I just can't get enough of her writing. She is truly an amazing author. If you haven't read her books, well you need to, you will not be disappointed. While I am sad to see this story end I'm looking forward to reading Scorpio Races and anything else she writes. This book was given to me as a review copy from the publisher, it did not affect my review in any way.",Unknown
9780312532765,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Despite the fact that this book was a bit different and very weird to read, I enjoyed it. I can't really explain how it was weird, but if you've read it or you pick it up soon you'll know why. It's just so different from the first book and it's just weird how everything is. Which is the point. It's SUPPOSED to be weird. After finishing Evermore, I had high expectations for this sequel. It's a very good book, but not as great as the first one in my opinion. But in the end I was left needing to read the third book. I really hope I can get my hands on it soon. I need more of this world and I'm VERY curious as to what happens next. Just like the first book, the sequel's writing pulls you in and gets you hooked on the storyline and you fly through pages before really realizing it. The same characters are back from the first book, and they've grown a bit and have become more real since the beginning of the first book. I really like Ever and her friends and Aunt, and definitely Damen. I mean, who wouldn't like Damen? There is a few new characters which I'm still kind of deciding about. Other than Roman, I didn't like him from the start. He really bugged me. With good reasons, which I'm not going to get in about. Overall, this was an enjoyable read and I can't wait to continue the series. I definitely recommend it. It has unique characters and a unique storyline and the writing is addicting!",Amanda

Things are looking up for Ever and Damen, who can finally be together. But just as Ever finds her power's growing, Damen's starts to fade. He's becoming weak and he's even starting to forget Ever. Ever travels to Summerland to save Damen, but while there she discovers she might be able to save her family. Ever must choose which path she'll take and who she'll end up saving. I really enjoy sequels, but they make me nervous, especially when I loved the first book as much as I did EVERMORE. But Alyson Noel surpassed all my expectations, and not only is BLUE MOON an amazing sequel - it sets the bar for the rest of this series very, very high! When I reached the last page of this one, all I could say was ""wow!"" There were numerous twists that kept me guessing. Just when I thought I had things figured out, I would get pulled in a new direction, which kept the book fast-paced and full of suspense - I had to keep turning the pages. I really liked the addition of Roman and the twins Romy and Rayne that Ever meets in Summerland. They added to the story but still have a lot of mystery surrounding them, so I'm eager to see how the many stories that were weaved together in BLUE MOON will play out. Another highly recommended book from Alyson Noel, I can't wait to read more about Ever and Damen. THE IMMORTALS series is one you'll want to get your hands on! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

Roman, a mysterious new guy at school is about to jeopardize all of her plans. Damen grows weak and sick and she can't quite figure out how to help him and is willing to do about anything to save him, but the journey promises to not be that easy. Blue Moon was totally amazing, even better then Evermore (which I really liked). I was so taken by Ever's emotion I was blinking back tears at more then one moment. I was so into the moment it was hard to bare to suspense and Ever's grief. The storyline is so well built it's insane, you really don't see the ending coming. I was completely shocked!Very well done Alyson the book is great and I can't wait to read shadowland!",Cindy Bacon

9780141337074,"This is the 6th instalment of a planned 9 book scifi time travel epic. Whilst each book has a near standalone ""adventure of the week"" storyline there is an intriguing and mystifying grand story arc that underlines all 9 books. This instalment however, changes that structural pattern and texture, instead taking us full whack into the main story arc from start to finish, effectively making this the most stunning and exhilarating entry yet. There are revelations here that would knock you out unconscious. With book 5 ending with a cliffhanger, book 6 wastes no time resuming where it left off, after a customary sidestepping prologue. In every previous book, the author, Alex Scarrow, has always exhibited a truly masterful talent for storytelling. He constantly drives the narrative at an entertainingly fast pace, exuding heart pumping thrills and a delightfully grounded, logical sense of imagination when depicting alternate realities, past, present and future, depending on the nature of time travelling tamperings. Every bit of science fiction from technology to social/society behaviour to time travelling are given realistic air of possibilities with logical (sometimes head spinning!) explanations. Scarrow maintains those quality ingredients in this novel but then excels further by sweeping us into the grand story arc, flooring us with the radical plot turns (which have clearly been planned meticulously well from the beginning), and infusing our minds with intelligent thought provoking philosophies on life, society and humanity, through the eyes of our much much loved protagonists, Maddy, Liam and Sal. But for all the mind blowing narrative wizardry, the heart and soul of the book always lie with the journey of 3 lonely teen-aged characters burdened with the simple task of saving the world with the most limited of external guidance, and a surmountable load of murderous obstacles. As much as Harry Potter fans have grown attached to Harry, Ron and Hermione, we Timeriders fans have by now become as equally attached to the fates of these superbly crafted characters and to their support unit sidekicks. The revelations in this book binds us even more towards them than ever. This book is their story all the way. There are other heavily written important elements in the story, characters and locations in time and space that will delight and instil fear in equal measure but I shall not mention any of them, as part of the fun is their reveal and integration with our protagonists' journey. I don't want to spoil any of that for you. There isnt as much action set-pieces and thrills as in previous books but that is compensated for the pure dynamite storytelling and I assure all Timeriders fans, you will be turning those pages no less frequent than the previous books, if anything you will be turning them quicker (I finished the book myself in 3 days). I actually thought book 5 was the pivotal point of the series and prematurely claimed that entry to be the equivalent of The Empire Strikes Back. I take that back, this is the TRUE Empire Strikes Back of the series. This is the game changer. This is magnificent science fiction. If you are new to the Timeriders series than this book may not make any sense, or have any impact if you jump straight to this. It is the least standalone book of the series. I simply recommend, without hesitation, for you to start with Book 1. I shall then envy you as you experience Alex Scarrows' remarkable science fiction chronicles for the first time. But as for you fellows Timeriders fans, ah Jay'zuz, wait til' ye get a load o' this one! Note: Dont be anxious about the last 3 books yet to be written and published. These books have been released at an astonishing frequency, at least 2 instalments a year. At this rate of Alex's incredible, almost android like, frequency of publications, those last 3 books may be all released by the end of 2013 and indeed, the next one is already scheduled for February 2013 release date.",Tej Dyal
9780385739146,"Don't get me wrong I do like this series, but this book felt like a filler to me, we don't find out anything new and Luce is starting to really annoy me, I feel like she only knows how to complain and act like a spoiled child who always gets her way, and I felt like screaming at her to grow up!! On the other hand we do get a little bit of information (hidden of course but it's there) and we meet more fallen angels and ""demons"" (well technically there all fallen angels but some are more fallen than others?? That is a bit crazy but...) and the outcasts (the name says it all, their not accepted anywhere and truthfully their really creepy) and we find out a bit more about the announcers. Other than that the most entertaining bit is when we meet Luce's new roommate, Shelby who is amazing (I seem to prefer the secondary characters in this series much more than the main) and amazing. Also we finally get to meet Callie (Luce's best friend) and Arriane comes back even if it's for a short period of time and I loved the thanksgiving dinner with everyone it was so funny^^",Nathiel Gold
9780385739146,I loved this book I can't wait to read passion it's a great series would suggest it to anyone wanting a good book,rebecca
9780385739146,I agree with most of the other reviews....the 2nd book was not as fleshy as the first book BUT still a good read that I finished in 2 days coz I couldn't wait to see where the story went (btw it didn't go very far). I don't know if it's coz I'm not a teenager but I personally find Luce quite annoying and there was a def lack of any Daniel story in this book. Like Twilight I am def team Daniel/Edward :). I'm looking forward to the 3rd book in the series as the author has stated it will fill in the entire back story of Luce and Daniel's Story - yay!! In the end; it is a good page turning story that is hard to put down but super easy to read.,Melissa Rogers
9780385739146,"Well the other reviewers had pretty much said everything but sometimes, you just need to vent the book out. I'd rate it about 3.75 stars because it wasn't too Twilightly but the aspects of it still there (I'm not a fan of Twilight at all). But one thing I do love about this book is that it introduces a love square with Luce being fought over Cam, Daniel and Miles. I am on Team Cam (if it exists) as you can tell that Cam does care for Luce in his own demonic ways and I hope that it will get explored eventually. I really do hope that Lauren Kate would not make Luce and Daniel togeather, it would just disapoint so many of her fans. If you liked Fallen then you will enjoy Torment as Luce finally gets some character development, even though the whole book is her whining about how she dosn't know everything and her pyning away for Daniel.",TinaTissue
9780385739146,Fallen and Torment! What can I say! They are a really good book. If you haven't read them then I strong suggest that you should because the adventures that Luce has is quite amazing. Well just saying that I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!!!!,Claudia
9780385739146,"EDIT (as of 15/6/2011): After reading other reviews and analyzing the story again, I have to say that I am wrong about Daniel and Luce. Luce is a self-absorbed, whiny and moping twit and I pity Daniel. I think because the author focuses more on Luce's perspective and emotions, she totally neglected Daniel's and thus, making me, as a reader felt as I did based on my first impression below. I take back what I said about Daniel because after looking at it at another angle, I totally feel for him. Ain't easy falling in love with the same girl again and again while knowing you're gonna lose her anyway sooner or later; while the girl know nothing of her past(s). I'm back to Team Daniel and I hope that Luce will actually GROW UP in Passion because I do want to love this series. ____________________________________________________________ I can't believe I'm gonna say this. I'm Team Miles but I know that's not ever gonna happen. *Heart shatters into millions of pieces* I just don't feel for Daniel. I don't know. He just doesn't give me the impression. I kinda got tired of him. Seriously. I was whooping when Luce defied him and was thinking twice about her relationship with him. *Ducks for cover* Gah, I rarely feel like that or don't at all for main characters. Daniel doesn't portray the strong character to me. It's like goody goody-protective-tormented Daniel living forever in his cursed life. Sigh. I didn't hate this book. I just didn't feel deeply for it. I'm sorry Daniel. I just need you to show more stuff. More substance you know. Not just ""Hey, we're unshakable. We're the only one for each other. I can't lose you. Yada yada.."" Plssssss...I need to see more character there. Luce and Daniel don't pull me. I find myself drawn more towards the side characters instead. Jasmine and Dawn had participation in the story for the first half and then they sort of disappeared towards the end. I didn't appreciate that. I find them, Shelby, Arriane, Roland, Miles and the rest more interesting compared to the main. I fell in love with the cover of Fallen and Torment. The synopsis of the story caught mt attention but I was kinda disappointed a lil' bit after I read them. Torment was a fitting title. Luce was in torment and confusion throughout the book. I can't believe I felt so relieved after finally finishing this book. Hopefully Passion will be better.",Joy Chuah Xin Yee
9780060887384,"The cover: This is by far my favorite cover :). I love the colors and the doll ^_^. The storyline: Okay. So this book is my favorite in the series so far. It had more action, more mystery, more twists and I swear I have no idea not even the tiniest bit who ""A"" is or what's wrong with Spencer and I love it!! Summary: Unlike the previous book, this sequel picks up three weeks after Toby's suicide (Yes, in these books, Toby is dead...), and the girls drifted apart again, especially since they thought ""A"" is gone along with Toby and the texts stopped coming. So they continued their lives as if nothing happened. Spencer is now seeing a therapist who's helping her cope with what's happening in the family (between her and Melissa) and deal with Ali's death. She's back at her usual self, studying and playing nice, hoping her family would not know about her essay and what she did. Then she's on the papers for being one of the finalists and suddenly, things start to crumble and crash and the bitter truth hits her. Aria is acting freely and following her heart in this book. She realizes she's not over Ezra, her crush and also her AP English teacher, and tries to deal with everything around her. She tries so hard to deal with her family issues until she makes them worse and gets Ezra arrested (although she didn't do the last one intentionally.). Emily is trying so hard to hide and escape her true feelings for Maya and the fact that she is gay. She swims, does her homework, has fun with Carolynn, until everything spills out and things go from bad to worse and she has to make a serious decision. And, last but not least, Hanna, I left her for the end because her parts in the book are my favorite. Hanna has a lot of problems, issues, complications and twists in her life that there could be a whole new book just about her! First, her dad is not talking to her at all and he won't even respond to her calls. Second, she feels betrayed by Sean for going out with her ex-best friend Aria. Third, and most importantly, she needs to stop her craving for food and throwing up. She has big plans for her and Mona and nothing else matters. Until everything with Mona goes real bad and everything she touches dies. Somewhere in the middle of the story, a private homemade video of Ali, made by Aria and the girls, before she went missing gets leaked to the media. And clues start to gather. The girls think that Toby is ""A"", and now that Toby is dead, ""A"" is dead, right? No. After a while, they start getting the most horrifying texts, threats and then ""A"" starts playing for real. What I loved: - The storyline is so different from the others and also, at the same time somewhat familiar (since I watched the episodes to the mid season finale...*_*). It had some intriguing details and storylines for each girl. - The twists, mystery and thriller! I kept looking and wondering and trying to solve each new puzzle, SMS and chapter's title! - This book could be scary if you read it at night (or actually listened to it at night). - I don't know if I just realized it or if it has been this way since book one. But I think the writing is much much better than before. - I loved both the main and secondary characters and how they had different personalities that added to the storyline. Each character in this book had something to do and it had a long lasting effect. - Aria, Spencer, Emily and Hanna are finally a tiny bit close. They try to talk to each other discuss everything ""A"" related. It a huge accomplishment, if you read the previous two books you know what I mean! - And then there was the ending!! I had no idea it was going to happen like that in the book and also it left me asking a billion questions!! What I disliked: Nothing really. The audiobook: The audiobook was amazing! The narrator did a great job of impersonating each characters, especially the girls, and the way she spoke in those scary moments, it made me feel like I'm being watched too!!! If you're not sure whether you should read the books or you don't have the time, I highly suggest you get the audiobook version. It's amazing! The characters: Aria: Always the nice, friendly and unique girl who does an excellent job in her AP English class and tries to fix things by making them worse whether intentionally or not. She tries to help her mom get over her dad and what he'd done and she ends up getting kicked of the house and disliked by both her mom and Mike, her younger brother. When she tries to make the right thing and goes to Ezra's house, she ends up... Well, making bad choices again. Emily: I really like her. She's shy, friendly and never hurts anyone. She also struggles with who she is and what she really wants but can't say or do anything to change things. Until her sexuality goes to the public in the middle of school and she has to stand up for what she wants. Hanna: Ah, she has the most interesting side of the story, but she's not my favorite character, I'll tell you why. She acts as if no one is better than her, and she keeps gossiping about other people, calling them with bad names and making fun of them like she wasn't once one of those people. Oh, but fear not, the table turns real fast and she soon enough finds herself with nothing but her shame and loneliness, thanks to ""A"" and Mona. Spencer: Seriously? I have no idea why she thought she could get away with plagiarizing her sister's essay. Spencer seems to be trying to be better than Melissa harder than she thought, but she doesn't acknowledge her tries until she meets the therapist again. But by going their, she doesn't only understand her relationship with her sister better, she also uncovers dark, deep and scary truths about herself. Truths that could get her in jail. Other characters worth mentioning: Sean, Aria's boyfriend. He's a really nice, modest and athletic guy. He's fascinated by Aria and really likes her, until ""A"" spoils the beans about her ""errands"" and the nice Sean turns out to have a dark side. Ezra, Aria's crush and also AP English teacher. Since they first met in a bar before he knew he was going to be her teacher, Ezra loved Aria and thought, later when he found out she's his student, that it would be better if they stayed separated. But, he obviously couldn't hold on for much longer. He should have, though, because now he's in jail. Ian, Melissa's boyfriend then and now. He's a very handsome and nice guy who Ali and Spencer used to have a crush on. But even this Angel could have some tricks up his sleeve. Ali, even in her death, she still haunts the girls and their lives. It looked like everyone loved Ali and envied her for everything she had. But the gorgeous blonde had secrets too, ones she hadn't told the girls about, ones that could be the reason behind her death. Maya, Em's love interest. She's a very smart and courageous person. Maya encourages Emily to be who she is and not be afraid of what the others might think of her. Favorite quotes: Her sister froze. The little gremlin that Spencer was certain lived inside Melissa's head was confused. Clearly it hadn't expected Spencer to say something nice. --- Chapter 6: SIBLING RIVALRY'S A HARD HABIT TO BREAK. SARAH WHITTIER, with that Milton quote, DEATH IS THE GOLDEN KEY THAT OPENS THE PALACE OF ETERNITY. Over the hill, Aria knew, were the graves of a dog named Puff, a cat named Rover, and a parakeet named Lily. --- Chapter 17: BECAUSE ALL CHEESY RELATIONSHIP MOMENTS HAPPEN IN CEMETERIES. It's not like it'll be hard: everyone in this town has something to hide. In fact, there's something even juicier than the identity of moi bubbling beneath Rosewood's glistening surface. Something so shocking, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. So I won't even bother. HA. You know, I kind of love being me.... Buckle up, girlies. Nothing is as it seems. Mwah! -A --- What Happens Next... Conclusion: Finally, I'm at peace, even for sometimes, in my brain that I could read and enjoy this book :). This book is that good! I'm really excited to continue reading ^_^. Now to continue with the series ;).",Randa Kerbache
9780060887384,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Wow, I'm not really sure what to say about this book. It's just so weird compared to the TV show. But in a good way, I think. It's starting to get where a lot of things are different in the books than in the TV show (Which always happens, but I can tell why.), but it's still addicting. I think I may have liked this one a bit more than the last two. They are getting better. I think I kind of wished now that I had read the books before watching the TV show, because of the fact that I keep getting confused when they describe a certain character and stop for a minute most of the time and go, ""What?"" because some of the descriptions are different in the TV show. And I keep picturing the actresses that play Aria, Spencer, Emily, Hanna and Alison. Ha! I think this is kind of funny. If you ask me who my favorite character is in the TV show, I would have to say Aria or Spencer. Though I like all the characters, but those are my top two favorites of them. But if you asked me the same question, but with the books, I honestly don't know. The characters are a bit more crazy in the books. If that makes sense. But anyway, I'm going to stop comparing the TV show and books. They are both great. The writing draws you in and keeps you reading. You can picture everything. At least I can. Normally I would have finished one of these books in a sitting or two in one day, but now I don't have much reading time. But I still can finish pretty quickly because of the writing style. It just flows. Overall, this was just as exciting and suspenseful as the last two. Even though I had originally planned to read another library book from my challenge list after finishing this book, I couldn't wait to start the fourth book and dove right in. So get ready for that review next!",Amanda
9780060887384,"PERFECT starts out with a flashback to a time when Ali was still alive and part of the group. Ali receives a phone call but doesn't share with Spencer, Hanna, Aria, or Emily. But that's kind of how it's always been. Ali was always the leader. Playing the girls off each other and keeping secrets on each of them. Now, Ali is supposedly dead and the girls have all gone their own way. Spencer has been nominated for the Golden Orchid. It's only the most prestigious essay contest in the country. The only glitch...no one knows that it's an essay that Spencer stole off her sister's computer one night when she didn't complete an assignment. Aria is still secretly crushing on Ezra, her teacher. When they first met, Aria didn't know Ezra was going to be a new teacher at Rosewood. There was an instant connection, but so far they've been good about not acting on those feelings. Hanna has had a major falling out with her now best friend, Mona. This has caused Hanna to resort to overindulging with food again. And Emily. Well, she doesn't want to be on the swim team anymore. And she does want to date her friend Maya, but knows how violently her family would react to that news. All four girls are still getting cryptic messages from the unknown ""A."" Who can possibly know all of their secrets, the ones that only Ali knew? As the messages keep coming, each girl gets tangled up in a web of her own creation. A cliffhanger involving the remaining girls leaves the reader ready for the next installment of the PRETTY LITTLE LIARS series, UNBELIEVABLE, due out in May 2008. I picked up the first book in the series on a whim the fall of 2007. I kept being drawn to the cover. I sat down and quickly devoured the first story. From there, I was hooked.

9780312624682,"Though a few of the details were fuzzy, it did not take me long to dive back into Kylie's world and character. I love her voice, the sarcasm, the emotion and the kindness and loyalty to her friends. She wants and needs answers, and she takes the avoidance tactic, which I am so familiar with. I really connected with her in the feeling like an outcast at times though. That is a theme in this book and it feels like a theme in my own life. But I really like how she deals with it, and it is so well written how she makes friendships and slowly builds them. And oh the drama in here, there are scenes I totally loved, and could imagine so clearly. Shifter fight anyone? Make out session? Oh yes, please. C.C.'s style is great and she draws me right into the world of Shadow Falls. The range of supernatural all in one place, working together is awesome, as well as the set-up with the tension and the antagonists. It's awesome to watch Kylie come into herself and figure out exactly what she is, and it leaves me with questions and speculations. I also liked how she made better decisions for herself instead of being weak, even when it was hard. I love this series and can't wait to make time in my schedule to read the rest!",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781595146021,"My biggest complaint about this book was the tortuous (to my heart) ending, and the lack of updates on my beloved Rose. And since Richelle has done this to me before, leaving me hanging and wanting so much more, I really expected it, though I have some awesome things to hold on to until Indigo Spell is released. As far as Rose, I know that this series isn't above her, it's about Sydney and Jill, along with smoking hot Adrian, but through Dimitri I hoped we might get a small guest appearance or something... But, that might just make it even harder to let go. So, notice that my biggest complaints were really praises for Richelle's writing? Yeah, safe to say that I totally enjoyed this book. Sydney is such a different main character from Rose, but she is still compelling, and it is such character growth to watch her struggle against what she has been taught her whole life and what she sees with her eyes, and feels with her heart. Are humans really capable of being as evil as vampires? Would you take a room of vamps that you trust over a group of humans that seem to be out to get you? Her answers were once crystal clear, but now, more and more she is changing. It is really hard to write the review without spoiling anything, but I loved to watch Sydney and Adrian. Getting the closer view into Adrian and what he is dealing with is exactly what I wanted at the end of Vampire Academy, and this series is delivering. His one-liners are fantastic, and we get to see a deeper and more intense side of him that VA only hinted at. I love Richelle Mead's young adult books (I haven't tried the adult ones yet, so can't speak for them), and she does not disappoint with this fast paced, page turning sequel and spin off.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

This book gave an in-depth and interesting perspective in the eyes of Bree. The telling of her struggles of confusion on becoming a newborm vampire, of leaving her old life and not knowing what she should do now. Then later conflicted with her loyalty to stay and obey Riley or to believe herself and leave, and maybe to even take a chance to fall in love.

9780007311255,"As part of the Essential Modern Classics series the book starts with an informative paragraph bio. of the author followed by an essay entitled ""Why You'll Love This Book"" written by a famous author, in this case Julia Golding. Then a quick blurb on just who is Julia Golding. This publisher's series also sometimes end with extra material at the back of the book called ""More Than A Story"". Here we have some very interesting pertinent information which really adds to the satisfaction of having read the book. First is a generous Author's Note describing the true story behind the characters who really once existed, then a section on sad but true information about Victorian Work Houses, then another section with bulleted information on the history of Barnardo's Homes for Boys and eventually girls. Finally rounding off with a Q&A with the author about the book which is very enjoyable. This book is based on the true story of an orphan, Jim Jarvis, about seven years old, who Dr. Barnardo credits with giving him the emotional push to start his homes for street boys. Only a basic outline of the real Jim Jarvis's life is known and the author has fleshed that out into a sad hard knocks life that eventually ends on as good a note as could be expected. Jim is orphaned in the work house where he spends a year until he escapes and then he finds a bit of happiness living in a shack on the waterfront helping a girl sell eels and shells, and making friends with other street boys, until her Grandfather finds Jim in his worthless shack and sells him to a coal worker where he is abused and worked like a slave. A few years go by and Jim wonders if he'll ever be free, since the one time he tried to escape has resulted in him being tied to the boat like a dog. An engaging story with many heart-breaking scenes and some that are poignant and heart warming. Though Barnardo enters the story at the end, this is very much Jim's story. A story of what life was like for a street kid in the Victorian era. The extreme poverty, the looming threat of the work house if the police caught you, the inevitability of having to steal or starve and sleeping on rooftops to keep safe from the law. The book is very much full of hardships but Jim is a determined boy with a will to fight to stay alive and avoid returning to the work house. Though his spirit may have been almost extinguished a few times he always manages to gather heart and keep resilient. This is a dark book, there is death and abuse and a sadness permeating its pages. But the writing and content is age appropriate. Jim's small victories and little bouts of happiness stand out in shining contrast to the world he lives in. The ending is heart-wrenching in a good way and leaves readers with a sense of good will and happiness that may make some kids interested in finding out more about Barnardo and his work.",Nicola Mansfield

Through this reading entered in history of Aislinn, that everything could be a typical teenager, it wasn't the fact that it has the gift of being able to see these beings, invisible in the eyes of other humans. When Aislinn was trying to live with the fairies, fulfilling the rules passed by his grandmother so as not to be discovered to have this gift, knows Keenan King of summer (being magical) that to many years trying to find his Queen to rid his Kingdom of the influence of his mother the Queen of Winter. From here we will watching events that are turning to Ash's life upside down, if by one side tries to escape to everything that involves other fairy feels attracted to this world by being forced to enter the game released by Keenan, subsequently we have Seth Ash's best friend the typical bad boy who loves Ash and help it to face this new world in which we see involved. Finally we have Donia, a fairy named as Girl of the winter, since it passed the test to become Queen of the summer, but that still nourishes very special feelings for Keeenan as well as this has for Donia, but despite all the inner struggle that goes on, I think that in the end turns out to be rewarded. In short, although I believe that the world of fairies was not much explored, I think that through the development of this story were released the data for us to awaken the curiosity for the next books.",Nidia
9780061214677,"Aislinn has always followed the rules. Her Grandmother has drilled them into her since she was a young child. Don't stare at invisible faeries. Don't speak to invisible faeries. Don't ever attract the faeries' attention. Aislinn has developed the skill to ignore them. She walks past them without flinching, even when the faeries are pinching or touching others around her like they love to do. Faeries come in many shapes and sizes and Aislinn has seen them all. She's seen them in the glamours they wear in order to pass as humans and can pick one out of a crowd even when they are trying to blend in. Aislinn has never been surprised by what she has seen them do - that is, until they start breaking the rules. Faeries don't like steel. It causes them pain and weakens them. Because of that, Aislinn's ""safe"" place has always been Seth's house. Seth is a long-time friend who happens to live in a converted steel train car. Aislinn always knew that if she could make it there she'd have peace, because the faeries could never follow her into the train yard. But, something has changed. They are creeping closer and closer and paying more attention to her. They are even gathering outside Seth's place. Aislinn really begins to worry when two faeries, Keenan and Donia, approach her and speak directly to her. She gets away from them as quickly as possible, now hyper-aware of the growing number of faeries surrounding and following her. She hears them say things like, ""Do you think she's the one?"" Aislinn realizes that in order to figure out what they want from her she is going to have to break the rules she's grown up with all of her life. Keenan is the Summer King. His mother, the Winter Queen, has limited his powers and is slowly taking over the elements. Days are colder and eventually everything will be covered in ice, unless Keenan finds the girl who is meant to be his Summer Queen. Together they would have the power to overcome the Winter Queen's chill. Keenan thinks Aislinn is the one and she is in danger because of it. The Winter Queen will do everything she can to prevent her son from getting the power he needs to overthrow her. Another problem, of course, is that Aislinn doesn't want to be Summer Queen. She has avoided faeries all of her life and she sure doesn't want to become one now. Especially when her feelings for Seth have developed into more than friendship - and becoming the Summer Queen would mean spending an eternity with Keenan. Melissa Marr has written a wonderfully inventive story that incorporates actual quotes from books written on the subject of faeries dating back to the 1800's. Her ability to keep a complicated story with several important characters clear to the reader is phenomenal. The relationship she creates between Aislinn and Seth is heartwarming, leading the reader to fall in love right along with them. If you aren't usually a fan of faerie stories, you might want to give this one a try. The blending of the realistic world and the world of the fey is masterfully done. You'll almost believe faeries are all around you.",TeensReadToo
9780061214677,"This was my first major foray into the world of Faeries. I have read Lament and Ballad by Maggie Stiefvater. This series of books is like mind blowing on the Faerie courts and laws . Wicked Lovely the first book I think is the easiest to read . They are wonderful books but perservere as the laws are detailed sometimes..but once you get the hang of it you are good to go. Each book cover represents the female character. #1 book is Aislinn, #2 Leslie..and so on I shan't give it away. Melissa Marr is an incredible writer..very detailed, I felt. Seth..sigh!!!! I was trying to work out if he was a little emo or gothic..but friends think he has a touch of emo but not gothic. You make up your mind. All I know is you will love Seth...he is the tattooed, pierced smexi lad with the blue black hair in Wicked Lovely. P.s. boy can he kiss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *fans oneself* You can really 'see' these books as you read them. Some readers won't take to Keenan. I did as he has his court to look after and he needs to do what he needs to do...which of course makes the book exciting. He can be a bit of a spoilt brat..but that just means Melissa is making you really 'feel' the characters. Really worth reading...but if you need to stop and get some bearings..then do it and continue. We helped a friend Carolyn get through them and she enjoyed them.

9780062224736,"Cruel Beauty by Rosamund Hodge is the story of Nyx who's mother died as a result of her father making a deal with the Gentle Lord, the same deal that ended up with her betrothed to marry the Gentle Lord when she turned 17. As a result pretty much her whole life has been in training to kill her future husband, a mission that she is knows will probably claim her own life. The novel starts on the eve of Nyx's wedding, during which time we find out that Arcadia has been infected with demons and placed under, effectively, a papyrus dome by the Gentle Lord who controls everything. Only the desperate and greedy make deals with him, under the belief they can be smart enough to make bargains that play out exactly how they want them to, but no one can out wit the Gentle Lord and everyone loathes him. Nyx believes she is the only hope, something she has been told her whole life, and as a result that has twisted her perception of who she is. She believes she should be a martyr, kind and true to the end, but she can't help but be envious of her sister and hate her father for everything that she has to go through; not forgetting the fact that he's sleeping with his dead wife's sister and yet Nyx is expected to avenge the woman who her father seems happy to forget about when it suits him. Nyx spends so much of the novel believing that her anger makes her a horrible person, but never takes the time to think that maybe it just makes her human, something the novel keeps hinting at but never truly gives Nyx a chance to realise. Of course she should be angry, she has to sacrifice her life at 17 thanks to circumstances she never had a hand in. Ignifex on the other hand has a darkness to him but isn't truly evil either. He was probably my favourite character in the whole book. From the start his teasing nature endeared me to him in a way that I never felt towards Shade. The link between the two love interests I felt was fairly obvious if you just thought about it for a second but it was still an interesting plot device. Overall, I really enjoyed Cruel Beauty. It is set in a wonderfully different world based on Greek and Roman history & mythology, although at times the revealing of certain aspects felt a little info-dumpy. The romance definitely won the book for me, it was sweet, teasing and different from most other YA novels. It felt doomed but wonderful. At times I could see links with Beauty & the Beast, Bluebeard and a few other fairytales, but that felt like a crutch to market the book on and I think it could have just been it's own great story without selling it as a retelling, although maybe there would have been lest interest in the book as a result. I think this would appeal to fans of the Graceling series, and I think it's going to become a series in the same way as Graceling; all subsequent novels being set in the same world but not necessarily about the same characters.",Iona

What she doesn??????C/???C/????!???C/????C/t expect is to fall in love with the monster, and actually want to be married to him. Can Nyx break the enchantment over her village? And was the sky always the colour of parchment? This book was weird. Just weird. Nyx was such an odd character.

She also seemed to like inflicting pain on herself, why else would she fall in love with a monster? And not just any monster ??????C/???C/????!???C/?? a monster that she has sworn to kill, has been raised to kill! A monster who she claimed to hate, a monster who caused the death of her own mother! The storyline in this was also weird. We had aspects of beauty and the beast, we had a touch of Rumplestiltskin and other fairy tales mixed in, and we also had mythology in there, with stories about Pandora! The storyline was complicated and confusing, and while at times I enjoyed parts of it, at other points I was really bored. The romance was bizarre. After being sent to kill her new husband and failing, she claims to hate him, and then when something happens and all she needs to do is step back and watch him die, she saves him and decides that she loves him!

9780062224736,"I requested Cruel Beauty when available to request on Edelweiss because I love the disney beauty and the beast, and I had also seen some highly positive reviews from trusted bloggers and wanted to experience for myself. The beginning of the book wasn't what I expected, and I didn't really get fully into it until Nyx was married and in the castle of the Gentle Lord. It was more about gods and goddesses, and repetitive moanings about her and her sister as well as a rather tedious to me set up of the world. Another thing that was lost in the retelling that was a favorite part of the Beauty and the Beast original was how Beauty sacrificed willingly for her family, and here Nyx really had no choice and she complained about it. However, several of my blogger buddies dubbed this a favorite so I kept with it longer than I might have otherwise. However, I started liking the world and the story picked up when we met Ignifex and Shade. Both had qualities that made me want to know more about them and this is where I started being interested and invested in the story. I began to respect Nyx more and more because she is downright real. She has love for her sister, but also resents her because her father chose her sister as the one to fawn over and Nyx the one to sacrifice to the gentle Lord. But she doesn't just accept these feelings, she really tries to control and let the love win out. The love triangle in this one is great. I was especially falling for Shade, and had a few theories about him, but I won't say because it would be a spoiler either way. He could only say certain things, and couldn't betray Ignifex because he was bound to him, but his gentle and believing nature really drew me to him. He helped Nyx when he could and I really pitied but also admired him at the same time for staying strong and still having hope after being imprisoned for so long. Ignifex was an enigma. He was cruel lots of times, which wasn't a surprise since he is the ultimate deceiver but he also showed concern and care at times when I am sure that he didn't have to. In some ways I come to pity him knowing some of his backstory, but it is hard to keep feeling that when I am reminded of all he did, all the pain he's caused. The romance between the two always took me by surprise seeing his gentler side, but just like Nyx, I questioned it, and wondered what the outcome could possibly be. Nyx has quite some adventures in exploring Ignifex's house, looking for answers, and trying to make things right, to fulfill her purpose and to find herself freedom. The ending was perfect for the story. I was kinda confused at what exactly was going on from about 85% up to well, about 95% but still, I think that I know, or at least I pieced together enough that makes me good with the story. I think part of it may be my sickness haze, but I dunno. Also, the ending was perfect. It somehow wrapped everything I wanted for this story (even when it seemed to be in direct contradiction to each other) and gave Nyx and ending that I couldn't even have conjured up. It had plenty of action, lots of character development and was a satisfying and good read that I am glad I stuck through the slow beginning for. So, I will say that it was def worth the read, it had a slow (for me) beginning, I was confused at the resolution but it had an enthralling love triangle (that I was right about for once), a main character I came to love for her honesty and a heart-pounding and satisfying ending. Bottom Line: A fantasy that had me a bit confused at times, slow in the beginning, but made it totally and completely worth it with the most unique love triangle and resolution I've ever read.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

When she's fifteen, her summer turns for the worst and an accident happens which causes her amnesia. Will she figure out what happened? Will her memories come back? You'll want to read this book even if it's just to read the twisty ending. This was the over-hype monster book that were getting people to grab it and read it. Naturally, I stayed away because over-hyped books are not my cup of tea. I generally don't like most popular books, and I have no idea why, but this popped up on RHC's monthly newsletter and I had to get it. I really did like this book. The wealthy family and their problems reminded me a lot of the Great Gatsby, but there's no Gatsby. No one to redeem themselves, unless you count Cady (kind off). I really wished the book stayed in the present tense because I was constantly pulled back and forth between the past and the present, and it pretty much confused me to what was going on. Pacing was very fast paced and I immensely loved how there were clues everywhere. And when there's a mystery, I pick it up and remember it because if done correctly the reveal can be unraveled. And so my theory was correct.. Wasn't really surprised by the ending, but I was still horrified it happened. As for the characters, I felt wholly disconnected from them. Even Cady's mom and her aunts. Don't get me started on how spoiled they were. One thing that blew my mind was the fact that Cady didn't know who the staff's names were. And that they were all POC. This book is super realistic. Money can really mess up a family and make it the most craziest problem ever. As for our MC, I don't know how many times I counted her saying how ""beautiful"" her family is. The outside appearance shouldn't really count. It annoyed me to no end. I did enjoy the fact that she defied her family and wanted to make amends.. Only did she did it in the most craziest way possible. I'm just saying that she wasn't the smartest person to be doing what she did. This family disgusted me. Through and through. Ripping their family apart just for money. Racism was also touched upon and I loved having a POC as the main love interest! Bonus points for that. Lastly, the ""poetic"" writing threw me off with it's pretentious symbolism. I just don't understand symbolism sometimes and I'd rather have something simple and straight to the point. Did not connect with any of the characters and the ""poetic"" writing threw me off with it's pretentious symbolism. Overall, I would read this for the twisted ending, especially if you're in the mood for a mystery set on a beautiful idyllic island.",Giselle SM

People were raving about the twist, and so I began hunting for this book in bookstores... only to realize that it hadn't even been released yet. Having now read We Were Liars, I can readily confirm that it is a thrilling read, a story absolutely brimming with secrets. Reasons to Read: 1. An emotional narrative: E Lockhart tells a brilliant story, although while not quite as shocking as I anticipated, of the tragic events to befall the main character's family (Cady). The writing style is poignant, and every mixed emotion felt by Cady is likewise experienced by the reader. As a reader, you are 2. A Shakespearean-esque tragedy: The day after having finished We Were Liars I saw a performance of King Lear, and it struck me how similar the two were in some ways. Let me emphasize that they are not the same story; but there are some characteristics the two share, such as the family dynamics. We Were Liars clearly evokes some of the feelings and themes from classical literature. 3. An unreliable narrator: I absolutely love reading books with an unreliable narrator, because I'm left guessing and gradually putting together all the clues and hints as to what actually happened. Cady is particularly effective as an unreliable narrator because even she isn't sure about the truth of what happened. After hearing so much about how the ending was truly shocking and surprising, I was a tad disappointed when I finished and discovered that my initial prediction was mostly correct (but not entirely). Then again, I think this was the ideal ending for the book and I don't think there could have been an ending that worked better with the story than this one. I won't say anything else because this is a story that must not be spoiled! This is the kind of book that stays with you long after you finish reading it. I'll have to find time to reread it, because I feel like I have more questions after having read it than I did before I started!

9780375838163,"TERRIER is the latest from a brilliant author whose earlier works you've got to read if you haven't already! My expectations for this book, as it is by Tamora Pierce, were, of course, quite high, and I was not disappointed. This might be my new favorite of hers (though it still might be beat out by the SONG OF THE LIONESS quartet--it's close), which is certainly saying a lot. It's the story of Beka Cooper, a Lower City girl and member of the Provost's Guard who lives centuries before Alanna the Lioness and those characters of her world known to fans of Tamora Pierce's other work. Beka lives in the dark time spoken of in one of the Alanna books when every sword, whether held by a man or a woman, was needed. Indeed, Alanna was not the first Lady Knight; hundreds of years before, women could earn their shields without having to hide who they were. In fact, one of the many fascinating characters known to Beka is a Lady Knight named Sabine. She reminded me of Alanna. Mattes, one of the guardsmen whose job it is to train Beka in their ways, reminds me of one of Alanna's friends, Raoul. Rosto is quite like George Cooper (whose ancestor Beka is!), as well. And fans of the SONG OF THE LIONESS quartet will also recognize Beka's cat, Pounce! When Beka trains to be a Puppy in the Guard, she knows someday she'll be a Dog, and she wants to be a good one. She's quite excited to be assigned to one of the best pairs in the Lower City; indeed, in all of Corus! She knows it'll be hard work, that Mattes and Clary will work her hard, but she's ready for it. This is what she wants to do. She's aided by her friends, her cat, and her magical Gifts of listening to the winds and to the pigeons who carry the souls of the dead. Soon after she starts her work, Beka learns of some dangerous goings-on in the Lower City, and it's up to her to stop it, as only a true Lower City girl could--one with Beka's listening talents, at that. She knows the people, she knows their ways, and she is uniquely fit for figuring out what's going on in her neighborhood, and that is what she will do. The format of TERRIER is different from that of Pierce's other books. It's told as Beka's journal, for one thing, meaning it's in first person. All of her other novels are in third person! It's certainly a change, but she does quite well with it. The only problem is the length of some of these journal entries! Beka is tired from her work as a Puppy; she's not going to write twenty, thirty pages in her journal at night! She probably won't even remember enough to write such long entries! That is the only flaw I found in this book, and that's easy to overlook. This is a page-turner, a wonderfully written story, with amazing characters.

9780778304340,"The Iron King starts with a high-school setting presenting Meghan Chase and her daily problems as a nobody. She is constantly insecure until her story transforms into a quest when her brother is kidnapped by faeries. As terrible this incident is, as positive it is for Meg's development. Forced to enter the fairy kingdom she dives into her true identity and discoveres who she really is. Meghan is a round character, she still needs to experience her true human and fairy identity and how to combine them. What I like most about her is that she introduces herself, which is no major point, but one small detail that can contribute to a personal relationship between reader and character. An old grudge between both male protagonists puts a new interest on the relationship between the three of them. Puck is Meghan's best friend and Ash on the other hand prince of the Winter Court. They are as different in looks as in personality, Puck is playful and warm, Ash cold and rejecting. Each single character, main and secondary, contribute to the constitution and establishment of the story's magic atmosphere. I enjoyed reading about Meghan and Ash slowly falling in love, especially because this one is once again a forbidden love. Meghan, the princess of summer court is not supposed to fall in love with Ash, who is the prince of winter court. Ash and Meghan are in a constant struggle between hot and cold. The cruelty of winter makes you flinch, the hotness of summer warms your heart. The story around Meghan, Ash and Puck has its origin in the Shakespearean play A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Iron King and A Midsummer Night's Dream have some characters in common like the fairy king Oberon, Queen Titania, Mab and Puck. So Kagawa based her novel on the idea of Shakespeare and further develops her own story around it. Noticeable is Kagawa's skilled writing style and her ability of writing beautiful scenes of romance on the one hand and creepy ones on the other hand. Several popular culture references complete the impression of her great writing style. The Iron King is a fairy novel for people who claim to dislike fairy stories. I am still no fan of pointed ears, but an even bigger fan of the rest that hangs on these two ears and defines the fairy personality. THE VERDICT The Iron King is a modern fairy novel based on the Shakespearean A Midsummer Night's Dream with non of its original magic lost.

An interesting plot line that keeps you haning on for more? Check. A beatiful princess? Check. A prince in disguise? Double check (Ash gets a double check because he is just simply amazing) The books plot is a fairy tale, but it's more like an original one rather than the disney ones, it's full of horror and fantasy, and true love and happy ending aren't garanteed, and everything and everyone has a price. Julie Kagawa is an amazing storyteller and keeps you interested in the story right from the begining. Meghan is the main character, an outcast at school her only friend is Robin. But one day she returns to school to find that her little half brother Ethan has been kidnapped, by Fae. Meghan is loyal and is willing to do anything to save the ones she loves, including sacrificing herself. So with Robin's help she travels to Nevermore, the land of the Fae, where she is in for a few surprises. Robin better known as Puck is a jocker and Meghan's best friend, he also hides a secret. And then we have Ash, dark, handsome and a prince (sigh) he is kind of the antihero who turns out good, more or less. I was crying my eyes out when he told Meghan why he hated Puck!! And Grimalkin he is amazing he kind of reminds me of the Chesire cat from Alice in Wonderland, in the fact that their both amazing cats :) I loved the references to Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare and I'm going to have to re-read that one sometime soon, once I find it^^ I'm sure it's somewhere on my shelfs... If not I'll rebuy it. And of course we have the enemy, in form of the Iron Fae born from the dreams of technology of the humans they are mortal to ""normal"" Fae. Will Meghan be able to save her brother and not loose herself or anyone she loves in the process? Read and find out, you won't be deceptioned.",Nathiel Gold

Seeing the good things of life is an easy forgotten art, despite how simple it may be. This is especially something that happens a lot in today's society. That is why Pollyanna, while being an classic, is the perfect book to read for young and old. Pollyanna is an optimistic girl who plays the 'glad game'. Which is simply just a game of finding stuff to be glad about in every day life. The harder it is to find something, the gladder it'll make you. I found myself to be highly entertained by the effects of Pollyanna teaching people the glad game. It even made me appreciate the small things in life more.

I just found it hard to get into and the story never really seemed to get going for me. I did actually put the book to one side about half way through and had almost decided on taking it back to the library unfinished ... until I read another review which inspired me enough to give it another try. I did end up partly skim-reading the second half but in the end I was glad I completed it - of only because I hate to leave a book without knowing how it ends.

So Ash, the daughter of a gentleman, was forced to become a servant to her stepmother and her two stepsisters.

Ash's world is a mixture of new customs and old traditions steeped in an ancient land full of stories and enchantment.

Fabulously sensory descriptions. As a bibliophile I adored the description of a book left to Ash by her mother. A truly enchanting tale. However, I did find the homosexuality to be glamorised. The book makes it sound like an easy choice to make, I do not believe this is the case. I have a few homosexual friends and know from their experience that it is a very difficult admission and can cause rifts with family and friends. On the whole a beautiful modern fairytale but I don't think I will be giving it to my children to read until they are old enough to understand the full implications of such choices.",Emma Davies

9781405253611,"Forgotten was just what I was looking for during my evening of insomnia (one of many such evenings). The story was gripping, the characters were interesting and I was able to read it in one sitting. Don't let the latter fool you; this isn't a simplistic read with little depth. Quite the opposite. Some of the paradoxes of London's bizarre condition will leave your head spinning. Every morning, at 4.33am, London's memory of the past resets and vanishes. She does have memories, but they are all of her future. This can be heartbreaking and reassuring for her. If she argues with someone, she can ""remember"" their friendship being fine in the future. She can also see all of the trials and arrows that her friends and loved ones might have to suffer. Aside from her name, London was a great character. She only had one moment of cowardice which soured her for me a bit, but I got over it as she was so cool. I admired how together she was in the face of both her inner confusions, and external antagonism. Her best bud, Jamie, did my head in. London tries to do the best by her, but Jamie is too self absorbed to take advice, offered with love, from an infallible source. This irked me. Luke is... well. In the tradition of the yummy male lead, he is yummy. My only qualm about him might be that he was a bit too perfect! He was caring, sensitive, hot, romantic, and did I mention yummy? His perfection put men of the real world to shame! But hush...don't tell my husband that! I thoroughly recommend Forgotten! It might have your head whirling and the ending is, perhaps, a tad abrupt, yet the narrative and characters are engaging and enjoyable. Oh, and it's less than a fiver on TBD!",Laura Williams
9781405253611,"The idea for Forgotten was a really unique one that intrigued me. Ms. Patrick wrote it well, and had me from page 1 and sucked in all the way until the end. How the main character, London, dealt with memories being reset was really cool, and I like that she could see into the future some to balance it out. If I were in her place, I don't know if I could handle something like that, but she lives a normal enough life. Luke was a great addition to the story. He was swoon-worthy and it was fun to see their relationship develop even with the unique challenges. How he was a blind spot was interesting, and I didn't know what to make of it. I can't imagine trying to have a relationship when you can't see him in your past or future, and it was cool how Ms. Patrick pulled that off. I found it all to be very believable. The twists kept me guessing and I couldn't guess what was going to come next. The way that she weaved all together and I could've never put it all together.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

In New Moon (the second book), Bella is left alone after Edward decides its best if he no longer see Bella. Jacob fills Bella's void and she learns that he's become a werewolf. The third book is a twist on that because Jacob and Edward (the warewolves and the vampires) form an alliance to destroy Victoria (an evil vampire) and her newborns (new vampires). Bella no longer finds that she is split - in having to choose between warewolves and vampires (Jacob and Edward) because she can have both. Jacob declares his love for Bella but Bella remains true to Edward. Bella is given an engagement ring from Edward towards the end of the novel. True Twilight fans will find themselves battling between team Edward and team Jacob in this book but I found the story seemed to go in circles between the two of them.

9780062014535,"Unlike the first 2 books, Delirium and Pandemonium, Requiem is told from a dual personality from two different characters, Lena and Hana. As I have mentioned before, I love when stories are told from different point-of-views. However, at first, I was a bit disappointed that Hana was chosen. It didn't take long to realize that having Hana's side of the story and what was going on in her world was imperative and just as intriguing and intense as Lena's world. There isn't much that I can tell you about the actual plot without any spoilers. But I am going to do my best in telling you why I think that this is one of the best endings I have ever read... In book one, we saw Lena on the inside being kept safe from the disease. She was doing what she had to do to just get to her surgery date so she wouldn't have to worry about what happened to her mother happening to her too. That is, until she met Alex. And learned that there is another way to live, as long as you have something worth fighting for. In book two, we watched Lena survive, learn and grow out in the wilds. She creates a new life, new friends become her family. And she meets Julian, who is sweet, safe and exactly what Lena needs at this moment in her life. She makes new discoveries about people she cares deeply about and we watch her reactions and the consequences to that. Now, Lena has come to the ultimate battle. Where does her alliance stand? With whom? What does she want out of her life - to make a stand and live with new consequences? Even death? Or will she try to take the easy way out, travel far, away from all the fighting and hide for as long as she can? And, what most of us have been waiting for... who will Lena choose? But there is so much more to just Lena's story. And Lauren Oliver makes it loud and clear, no matter what life brings, you always have a choice. Don't hide from anything, no matter how scary it may be, or how hard, you have the right to do what you believe in. Follow your heart. Yes, at times you may choose wrong, you may fall down many, many times. But in the end, what truly counts, is that you are honest with yourself, with others. And don't let anyone ever stop you from doing what you want to do. The last page of Requiem, page 391, will forever stay with me. I've told many people already - I want to get another copy of this book so I can tear the last page out and frame it. It's something that I want to remind myself of. It's something that I want my kids to know... ""Tear down the walls."" Don't build barricades around yourself, or you'll always live in fear. I highly recommend this series to everyone. Love is not a disease. Fear is.",Margarita Cortina
9780062014535,"Originally reviewed on my blog, here http://iloveteenbooks.blogspot.com/2013/02/book-review-requiem-by-lauren-oliver.html Some reviews are so hard to write. You loved the book so much, and you feel so many emotions about it that you can't concentrate and write the review that it deserves. Right now, I am going to try to write this review, which I believe it's the toughest one to write since I began reading and reviewing. Where do I even start? I will start with the characters and do a short analysis and tell you what I liked and disliked. I'll start with Magdalena. Lena Haloway I love you! Lena has grown so much since the start of the series. Remember that little, hesitant, slow in acting Lena we met in Derlirium? In Requiem you will see the opposite of the old Lena. Like she said in Pandemonium, the old Lena is dead. That was definitely proven in this book. She was tough! She was fierce! She was determined! SHE TOOK DOWN THE WALLS! Alex and Julian. Ahh those two.. You know what happened at the end of Pandemonium. (Pandemonium spoiler alert) Alex got back. In Requiem, he was kind of weird, and did not know what to do. I felt sorry for him at times. Watching your love, hugging and kissing with another man is tough. HE TOOK DOWN THE WALLS! I grew to love Julian a little bit more. He was a great character. Since it was his first time in the Wilds, he was awkward at times, but still got his way right. HE TOOK DOWN THE WALLS! Let's discuss about Hana a little bit. SHE IS ONE JEALOUS BITCH! And, I love her! I totally love her. I am now aware that, everything she did, and the ways she acted, was because she was cured. You will grow to love her again! I almost died at one of the chapters near the end of the book. What she did was unbelievable! SHE TOOK DOWN THE WALLS! Now, I have to say few words about Lauren Oliver's writing. You all know that her writing is unbelievably beautiful! She proved that she can write in Delirium and Pandemonium. But in Requiem.... She took her writing to a whole different level! She really out-did herself! Her metaphors could make you think about your life! Her writing can make you cry and laugh at the same time! Bravo! I guess she kind of took down the walls too! All I could say now, is READ THIS SERIES!!!! You don't know what you're missing if you haven't read it already! Breathtakingly beautiful. Astonishing. Remarkable. Requiem will really surprise you! TAKE DOWN THE WALLS!",trayche
9780062014535,"I had a significant number of worries coming into Requiem. This book was easily my most anticipated read of 2013; I've invested so much emotion and energy into this story and its characters. Delirium easily stands as one of my favourite books ever. But there was so much riding on this one little book! I'd say that Alex, rather than Lena, is my favourite character of the bunch and Pandemonium just didn't seem to set things up for the ending I wanted to see. And there's always something heartbreaking about the ending of a series; bittersweet, like saying goodbye to old, familiar friends. I'll say right away that I was not nearly as disappointed or as devastated as most other readers seemed to be by Requiem. It made me look at the trilogy from a whole new light, and I'm curious to see how I'll feel after re-reading the three books. Also: this review is the hardest one I've ever written, hands down. Reasons to Read: 1. A story about love that's about more than romance: One thing I've noticed is how easy it is for us readers to get caught up in the Julian/Alex debate. But while reading Requiem, I soon became aware that this was not the biggest focus of the book or even the series. I'm so appreciative that Lauren Oliver took the chance to explore other avenues of love, from the relationship between Lena and her mother, to her best friend Hana, to the deep, life-altering friendships she makes in The Wilds and within the resistance. I think it's easy for us to focus so much on these swoon-worthy boys that we miss some of the other heartbreaking moments; for me, it was notably the deterioration of Lena and Hana's friendship and Lena's lack of a relationship with her mother, Annabel. And you know what? I was honestly & pleasantly surprised by how much Requiem didn't focus on the romance. That's a blessing in YA these days and really great for those who want to see more from a book than just romance. Yet it still has some of the best romance I've ever read about (in the series, as a whole). 2. Lena's epic character transformation: I'd hate to call this ""character development"" because it's much more than that - rather, it's more like an evolution. When you compare the old Lena from Delirium to the changing Lena in Pandemonium with the new Lena in Requiem, it becomes apparent how drastic these changes have been. Yet, one thing I noticed re-reading Delirium is that the seeds of change were already planted in Lena before Alex ever came along. I might even say that she's more like her mother than she may ever realize. But I believe it is entirely consistent with her character and who she is for this transformation to take place. 3. A world falling apart: One of my favourite parts of this series is that Lauren has so much attention on the world she's created, and really works to bring it to life through her stories. I found Requiem to have a bit more of an emphasis on this, and we really get to see a society that's crumbling apart. I'm incredibly curious to know what happens in the future, but I think it's clear that big changes are coming for society. 4. Hana offers a fresh perspective to the book: Hana is easily one of the most interesting characters from the Delirium cast, and I think this is another reason in support of saying that by Requiem, it's very clear that the books are about so much more than a love triangle or even just Lena's life. While Lena is busy with the resistance, Hana is our insider view to Portland and the ""upper class"" of that community. I found Hana's story to have the potential to be just as heartbreaking as Lena's, and her voice stood out so much from Lena's narrative that it was a great way to freshen up the series. I'll also admit that it would take a lot for me to truly hate this book - I'm well aware that I'm biased (and maybe partially blinded?) by my love for these books. And I can understand why so many readers may be disappointed by how few plot elements are actually wrapped up. That is disappointing, but I can see how the open-endedness works well too. (For me, I'm happily convinced that Alex and Lena are together forever and have ten happy little babies and they spend a lot of time reading poetry and kissing. It doesn't matter what happens in these books, that has always been the ending I invented.) I was, however, a tad disappointed with Lena at a few points. I was surprised by her reactions a few times, particularly when it came to Alex and Julian because most of that felt so immature. While something so big is happening with the resistance, it didn't fit to have so much angst between a handful of characters about personal problems. Maybe it was the stress of it all that brought out their worst, but it largely felt out of character to me (and yes, I'm pointing my blame-finger at you too, Alex). I've tried my best to be spoiler-free here, but I have a lot of ideas and thoughts I'd like to discuss more in a spoiler-friendly format. So expect a spoiler-y letter where I vent all my feelings to Lena for catharsis. SOON. And I'm most excited to read the special short from Alex's POV in the first edition Requiem books! I'm hoping that it will give me my necessary dose of Alex Sheathes",Brenna Staats
9780062014535,"Originally reviewed on http://michelleshoutsrandom.blogspot.com/2013/01/book-review-shatter-me-by-tahereh-mafi.html *** Rating: 4.5 stars *This review is based on the advance reading copy the publisher sent me. There might be some changes with the finished copy. Love is not a disease. Love is a natural feeling one deserves to feel. That's the knowledge Lena kept fighting for all throughout the trilogy, along with the other Invalids. Requiem is the much-awaited last installment of Delirium trilogy. I've been waiting to read this book the moment I finished Pandemonium, the second book of the trilogy. Like Delirium, Pandemonium has its killer cliff-hanger. The stakes became higher and love has never been so difficult. Could it be Julian or Alex? Requiem is told in two POVs: Lena's and Hana's (Lena's best friend). On Lena's POV, she continues to live in the Wilds together with her Invalid friends and Julian and Alex. She struggles to be with the two guys that she loved, and choose one from them. Moreover, she also met a person she didn't expect to meet again, and together with the Invalids, runs and hides from the government while planning for their attack. While on Hana's POV told her life as a Cured with her guilt, her past and her struggle to be the perfect girl her family and community wants her to be. Both related, both confused, both trying to prove their worth, both have a hard decision to make but both willing to fight. This book took me by surprise. Mainly because I didn't expect anything. Well, maybe the more complicated life of our dear main characters and their fight for their freedom. But yeah. This book is really good. Bettttter. As always, Lauren-Oliver style, this book was written intelligently. The scenes, the twists and add ons are well-thought. Requiem also contains a well-defined Lena. She becomes braver, risk-taker while being the same old sweet Lena. She's grown and I couldn't imagine her as the old Lena: afraid of breaking the rules, and always hiding behind Hana's shadow. What I didn't liked about her is her fast change of feelings about Julian and Alex. When one is gone, she likes the other and forgets about the other one. It's confusing me and doesn't convince me that much when she says she love this guy, later on. Alex is back, of course. But I kept on searching for him. There are changes about him and he didn't received any highlight in this novel. It's like he's there but I want to feel him. I hope he had more spotlight since he disappeared in Pandemonium. Julian is pretty cool. And cute. I want to give him a hug and I want to be a fairy godmother so I can give him a happily ever after (don't freak out; he's not dead or something!). It's just I want to do those things when I think of him. I can really say that Requiem got really better. Very nice. Exciting. I didn't even realized the time and how much pages I've turned til the sun dropped down the horizon and I barely have a light for reading. I'm totally absorbed. The ending is unbelievable in a it-cannot-end-that-way-I-need-to-know-more way. I want more than the ending the author gave it. It doesn't have to be that way, can it? I mean, I'm not asking for one more novel, but an e-novella's not a bad idea! I want to know what happens. To their community and the lovely characters. I want to congratulate Hana and smile at Grace. I kept imagining things what happens to them. Or maybe that's what Lauren Oliver thought to do--keep us thinking and never forget this last novel. Of this trilogy. Because you know what? I wouldn't.",Michelle Sedeno

9780316234498,"I received a digital copy from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I hoped. I liked the characters, I enjoyed the setting and I liked that not every thing had to be about love - even though it is quite prominent in this book. Somehow I really like Clarke, how she cares for others and how brave she is. But something I hate about her is how quickly her emotions change, one second she's forgiving and happy and the other she's so mad - sometimes for a reason but other times out of the blue. It kind of annoyed me. Glass... I don't really know what to feel about her. Some part of me like this hopeless romantic who'd do anything for the boy she loves - but another part thinks she's weak and has to stand on her own. I also feel like this love story between her and Luke (=the boy she loves) is just Kass' way of throwing some 'Romeo and Juliet' in the book. Wells, again, another character I both love and hate. I kind of admire him for going to Earth because he wants to make sure nothing happens to Clarke, he loves her which is both a bad and a good thing, I think I like him a bit more than I hate him due to him maybe drawing the short straw too many times. To sum my feelings up on characters I don't think there's a character that I absolutely love or hate, they are all 'neutral' I guess, which is pretty frustrating. I liked that we see the story from different point of views, we have Glass, Clarke, Bellamy and Wess who's basically our main character and eyes. In a way it was also quite confusing at times but I still enjoyed it. I also specially loved that we both see what goes on on Earth and on the Spaceship as well. To be honest though, until about 60-70% of the way through I was pretty neutral about the whole book, but those last 30-40% was pretty intriguing and it ended up being quite the page turner. Nevertheless I ended up enjoying this book and I hope the sequel is better or at least just as good as the last part of this one.",AmandaEmma

Doing this, I felt that the story flew without any hesitations - and there were so many emotions: very powerful moments and decisions. Oliver's words have a way of imprinting themselves on your heart... I felt Lena's struggles, not only within herself but with the elements around her too. I ached so much for Alex. I missed him more than I ever thought was possible. Such raw emotions and writing is a rare thing to find in a second book to a series. Then: We see Lena as she was when she was found in the Wilds. How she survived and the things that she had to learn. This Lena is scared and questioning whether or not she made the right decisions. She's also heartbroken and so lost without Alex. But her thoughts of him are what keep her going, sane and hopeful. Being in the Wilds is scary and tough. Lucky for Lena, she 'found' a good homestead with caring and experienced people that took her in - Raven, Blue, Tack... Now: We see Lena in the present, a year after she has entered the Wilds. There's a mission that has to be completed and her role is very important and pivotal to the story. This is where we also meet Julian. And there are many other discoveries to be made - there are other people and worlds hiding and living within the system. At this point, this book, it is so crucial to know everything about Lena... it helps to prepare you for that unpredictable ending! Yes, it is a grand cliff-hanger! But one that I didn't mind at all and loved! Now, onto Requiem!!!",Margarita Cortina
9780061978067,"This second installment of the Delirium series takes place both in the wilds and in New York during a resistance movement, moving back and forth in time. The chapters are pretty clear about where you are. The story starts soon after Lena escapes over the fence and how she survives in the Wilds. I loved the addition of some of the new characters, especially Raven. I have to say, though, that there were a few logistics about their life in the Wilds that drove me crazy, like: Why do they wait until winter's there before they move camps? Why don't they just live somewhere warmer and set up a homestead and try to become self sufficient? Why do they have to rely on the cities for so much? Why, if there is a hardware store nearby, do they only have one shovel? OK, enough of that rant. These are not deal breaker issues, the story was still great, just things that frustrated me. On the other hand, this time in the Wilds was compelling, the dynamics of the community, the constant peril, the heartbreak of peoples stories... In contrast, the story alternates in a future time as part of an underground resistance movement in New York. There were some great twists in this part and, again, the addition of some new characters. I liked Julian, the son of the DFA leader, and how he grew and how the alliances and betrayals worked out. I really love this series, though I didn't like this book as much as Delirium. Oliver's writing is brilliant and absolutely beautiful - she crafts words like an artist. And, I love the premise behind this book - that of a dystopian future where love can be ""cured"", along with the consequences of that. After the dramatic twist at the end, I can hardly wait to get my hands on Requiem (one of the advantages to coming to a series late!)",Coreena McBurnie
9780061978067,"I KNEW it!!! That's all I have to say about the ending of this book. In a good way. It's one of those endings that has you saying ""No way!"" while at the same time you were secretly hoping for it to happen the whole time. This second book in the series started off slow for me. In terms of plot, things move a little slowly in the first half while we find out what happened to Lena in the time after she escapes Portland. We learn more about the ""Invalids"" and how they live. There is more world-building. All of this is interesting and necessary but the book really gets going in the second half which has a lot more action. In terms of character, we see a lot of Lena's progression from soft, sheltered, whiny girl to hard, competant, strong and smart. She still has an emotional vulnerability that draws the reader in without being too angsty. I loved Julian! It was refreshing for me to see a male character who is vulnerable and emotional while still remaining masculine. He really became a favorite of mine. I started off thinking I was going to rate this about a 3 but after finishing I give this a solid 4 stars. I'm very much looking forward to the third book in the trilogy!",Cherie
9780061978067,"Pandemonium is the thrilling sequel to Delirium, one of my most anticipated titles for 2012. While it was a great book with a great story line, for me personally, it didn't live up to the awesomeness that was Delirium. The first book set a really high standard and after that ending I was eagerly anticipating the sequel. Where Delirium explored the setting and the characters, Pandemonium focuses on Lena and her survival in the Wilds and her involvement with the Invalids she meets there (this is not a spoiler imo, the blurb reveals just as much). I didn't like Raven, who is a pretty important character in this book, and I couldn't relate to her in any way. She appeared inhuman, being as harsh as she was, and I didn't like that she wasn't made more believable. I quite liked the other new characters, who include Tack, Julian and Sarah. The story is less dystopian than its predecessor, focusing more on Lena's survival instead of on the dystopian society that's in place. Lena really grows up in this book, learning how to survive and how to resist the 'cure' and make a statement against the people who believe in it. I really liked her development and her way of adapting to her new life. Don't let my slightly critical review put you off reading this book - it's a great book and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I'm just being a bit critical, since I loved the first book in the series so much and this book isn't as good, in my opinion. Having said that, Pandemonium is a fast paced, twisty tale of survival, full of suspence and betrayal, love and desperation, hope and a strong female character who will ensure you will want to read Requiem right after you flip the last page.",Daphne for Loving Books

9781416960607,"I received my copy of LIVING DEAD GIRL right before it came out in September. I read it the same day, and promptly hid it in a huge stack of other books, hoping to forget about it. I didn't. I came across it last week, and sat down and read it again. This time, I knew that, just like before, I'd never forget it, but I finally decided I was ready to write a review on the story. Alice has lived with Ray since she was ten. Now that she's fifteen, she knows her time with him is about to come to an end. The only question will be how it will happen - whether Ray will kill her, or whether she'll kill herself. You see, Alice wasn't always Alice. She was once a girl with a mom and dad who loved her, until the day Ray abducted her during a school field trip. Although they don't live far from her childhood home, Alice has only once made an attempt to escape, and that was right after she was abducted. Ever since then, she's become the emotional/physical/sexual slave that Ray has turned her into, and she does what she's told, when she's told. When Ray sets his sights on Lucy, a replacement girl, Alice couldn't be more thrilled. Her time with Ray is finally, finally coming to an end, and all she can do is experience immense relief. She may have a moment's doubt about setting up a small, young girl to go through the same torture and torment she has endured, but basically, that overwhelming sense of relief is all she can bring herself to feel. Events unfold quickly, and the ending of the story is not a resolution so much as a beginning to an entire new set of complications. I hated LIVING DEAD GIRL, in a way that made me love it. With a storyline that could have been ripped from today's newspapers, the feelings and emotions that it will invoke within you are myriad - horror, sympathy, outrage, disbelief. When I heard a similar story in the news about a year ago, my first thought was how a child who had been abducted could so willingly stay with their captor. What I learned through the pages of this book is that fear - the kind of fear many of us have never known, and will hopefully never have to know - is a huge motivator. Alice lives by fear. Fear of eating something she's been told not to eat. Fear of talking to someone she's been told not to talk to. Fear of bathing when she's not been told to bathe. Fear of saying something, anything, in the wrong way, or at the wrong time, or with the wrong tone of voice. Fear, plain and simple, can cause people to do all sorts of things. Elizabeth Scott is to be thanked for writing a story that brings the issue of child abduction to light. As Alice says, there are three life lessons: No one will see you. No one will say anything. No one will save you. Unfortunately, she's all too often right. I hope that after reading LIVING DEAD GIRL everyone will see, everyone will speak, everyone will be compelled to save. Hope for Alice may be gone, but there are many Alice's out in the world, and thanks to this story, they don't always have to live in fear that no one will save them. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781416960607,"This novel picks up right from the start. The main character ""Alice"" is abducted by a man named Ray who calls her his ""little girl"" and this is where everything goes wrong. Since she is his little girl, he goes to great measures to prevent her from growing up. She was 10 when she got kidnapped and now she is 15. He starves her all the time, gives her pills to stop her periods, forces her to get Brazilian waxes and worst of all rapes her whenever he pleases. You might be thinking why doesn't she just run away. Well, since she has been living with him as a child, he has planted this idea in her head that if she tells ANYONE he will burn down her old house and kill her entire family. Just because of this Poor Alice takes in all the unbearable abuse, pain and beatings from him. This book is a real eye-opener to the world most of us are unaware of, sadly. The reader of this book needs to have a strong heart to take in all the unbearable cruelties. The scenes are not too descriptive and graphic, but the author tells them in a way where you know exactly whats going on. You might not want to believe it is what you think it is, which leaves you wondering,often. I had to put this book down a countless amount of times just to take in all the information. I really felt for Alice and wanted to rescue her every dreading moment i read. The ending was good and satisfactory because it could not have been told any other way. We always hear such cases happening on TV and newspapers.But this book allows you live the nightmare along with the victim. After reading this, every time you hear of such cases, you'll know exactly what went on behind closed doors. Which makes me wonder exactly how did the author know what the victim was feeling. Seems like a you had to be there kinda moments. Like you have to walk in someones shoes to feel what they felt. Anywayz, i would really recommend this book to all girls, mothers and women because we all need to take great measures to protect ourselves and this book just might give out a few very helpful pointers.",JiYa

Chloe Saunders is a very special girl. Not just because she has an in-depth and intense obsession with movies, filming, and directing. Not just because of her unusual home life. She is special, because on top of all this, Chloe Saunders can see ghosts. On the day of her first period, she goes to the bathroom and skips class. She dyes her hair, feeling particularly rebellious. Upon exiting, Chloe sees a strange man wearing an old custodian's uniform, who follows her around school. She thinks she is in trouble for skipping class... When he starts to talk to her, she ignores him. He gets angry, and deliberately shows her his face... and she sees it is burned so badly she can barely distinguish his features. When he disappears into thin air, she starts making a scene and freaking out, and school officials round her up. When she accidentally punches a teacher, they sedate her and take her to the hospital. From there she is sent to Lyle House, which is a place for troubled teenagers. There she meets a wide variety of people - a pyromaniac, a girl with a poltergeist, an unusually moody girl, a boy with extremely bad people-skills, and a boy who, strangely, she finds nothing unusual about. As her new friends' stories unfold, Chloe begins to question the motivation behind Lyle House. With everything from ghosts and magic to romance, humor, and growing up, THE SUMMONING will have you laughing, wondering, and in disbelief.

9780061450549,"Kelley Armstrong took her creativity to new heights if you ask me, with her series opener, The Summoning (Darkest Powers, #1). I'm not sure what I was expecting and I know I'm late to join the fan club for this series, but I'm joining all the same. The Summoning is chalk full of mystery, paranormal events, suspense, budding romances, and bite your nails because you can't stand it tension and of course tons of fun in between. Chloe is our main character and narrator in this series and the poor thing can't have her dreams come true for a normal life. No, normal is not how you would describe someone who can see ghosts, now is it? She's sent to a group home following a pretty scary incident at school revolving around, you guessed it...ghosts, and Lyle House is not your typical ""rehabilitation"" facility for troubled teens. She's introduced to her ""house mates"" and although reluctant to make friends and trust her ""crazy"" fellow inmates, Chloe quickly learns to befriend some of her co-residents. Along the way Armstrong unfolds a mystery that still has me thinking. This is a mega-mystery, a conspiracy and an all out complex puzzle that will keep all readers guessing and questioning everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) the whole way through. The ending was also a turn of events I did not see coming for all the world, whoa! is all I can say! I love when an author can keep me entertained and not frustrated with the lack of answers, but instead has me chomping at the bit and flying through the pages to know more, more, more. I'm officially a Kelley Armstrong fan and I'm going straight to the bookstore to pick up The Awakening (Darkest Powers, #2) to see where the fun and mystery goes from here.",Katelyn

9781416972198,"Methamphetamine use, commonly known on the street as crystal, tweak, the New Prozac, and crank, has become a growing problem in the U.S. in the last several years. From what I have read, there is no worse drug addiction than crystal meth. It not only affects the person using but the personal relationships they have, as well. It is not just my humble opinion when I tell you that these drugs have the power to kill or cause great harm. A great example would be Nic Sheff, the author of TWEAK. At an early age, just a babe himself, Nick had his first taste of drugs and alcohol. Drug use escalated in Nic's case - he went from just smoking pot to abusing cocaine, heroin, and crystal meth. For over a decade, on and off, Nic used drugs. The book opens up with a bang - Nic relapsing after 18 months of being clean and sober. You can call TWEAK a young adult book if you like, since Nic is a young adult, just in his twenties, but in actuality it is a book that will appeal to any age level, young and old alike. Teens will definitely gravitate to Nic's story because of the fact that it is someone about their age using drugs, and they can relate to it (maybe not completely but on some level). The general public may find it of interest, because it will give them an insight into the mind of an addict. Perhaps a reader may find comfort in this story, knowing that he is not alone. It occurred to me as I was reading TWEAK that the book was like a cleanser for Nic; a way to cleanse his soul. Writing TWEAK couldn't have been easy for him, as Nic had to relive everything he did and put it down on paper. Some of what I read admittedly shocked me. I can't imagine what goes inside an addict's mind. The book was so honest; at times I ached for him. Other times I wanted to strangle him for what he was doing to himself and his family. I hate to say that I didn't think his clean and sober status was going to last very long. It was as if it was too good to be true. At the end of the book, we learn that Nic is now clean and dealing with his demons on an everyday basis. I expect that this is not going to be an easy road for him or for his family. Everybody participates in addictive behavior in some way or another. Some people believe that people get involved in addictive behaviors because they are reckless, self-absorbed, and have no self-control. For the most part, I stand in the camp that believes that drug and alcohol addictions are diseases. You may choose to get treatment, but once an addict always an addict. Nic is never going to escape the addict label even if he does remain clean the rest of his life. Nic's father, David Sheff, also has written a book about meth addiction. BEAUTIFUL BOY looks at Nic's addiction through the eyes of a parent. Mary Pipher, a psychologist and the renowned author of the book REVIVING OPHELIA, says on the jacket of David Sheff's book: ""When one of us tells the truth, he makes it easier for all of us to open our hearts to our pain and that of others.""

These ghost-like beings are called wraiths and might be new to the reader, but have a long history that has in some way always related to vampire's. We learn more about their history and also the origin of the supernatural beings that inhabit the Evernight universe. Stars and astronomy are a present motive in this series. They support the melancholic and romantic aspect of our lover's relationship. This part of Lucas' and Bianca's story is all about longing! The title STARGAZER suggests a romantic and dreamy read which this novel definitely offers. But like many other second novels in a series, this one is a bit slow and uneventful, too. Bianca expands the relationships to fellow classmates and also to characters that could threaten her life any instant, but that is what makes it more interesting. And also new villains are always needed, so Gray introduces a few more of them. Gray's writing and her varied vocabulary fit the novel's spirit and fill her cast and dialogues with substance. In comparison to other vampire novels, STARGAZER throws light on the transformation aspect of vampires. It's interesting that the concept of vampires is not rigid, but malleable. THE VERDICT I give it 3,5/5 stars. A romantic and melancholic novel that is supported by a skilled writing.

So when Lucas manages to get a message to her, arranging to meet in secret, she's willing to do anything to make that happen. Even if it means sneaking around the school trying to discover the secret Lucas's family so desperately wants to discover. Even if it means pretending to date Balthazar, Lucas's rival, as an excuse to leave school grounds. As if all that didn't complicate her life enough, Bianca realizes there's something scarier than vampires lurking within Evernight's walls. Something that has a particular interest in her. Soon, Bianca finds herself questioning everything she thought she knew: about vampires, about her love for Lucas, and about who and what she really is. Fans of EVERNIGHT will be delighted with this sequel, which offers the same passionate romance and Gothic mystery as the first book, combined with intriguing new characters and conflicts. Bianca continues to struggle to take control of her destiny, balancing strength and vulnerability.

Holland Jaeger is the ""It"" girl everyone envies--she has great friends, she's President of the Student Body, she's the girlfriend of Seth, she's the popular girl who can be counted on to always get along with everyone. That is, until Cece Goddard transfers in, and Holland's once-perfect life no longer seems so great. The first time she sees Cece, Holland feels something that she's never felt before. Although sexually active with her boyfriend, Seth, having sex is more like a chore--she'd much rather sit around talking, the way they used to do when they were friends rather than lovers. As Cece flaunts her homosexuality, wearing shirts proclaiming herself out and proud, Holland wonders what it means when her attraction to Cece becomes almost an obsession. College looms on the horizon and no one, especially her mother, will quit asking her where she's going. They have big plans for her, you see, both her mother, who became a single parent way too young, Seth, and the career counselor at her school. Forced into a role she doesn't want, Holland escapes into her art class, drawing away from her former friends as feelings and emotions she can't control rush to the surface. As Holland realizes that she is, in fact, a lesbian, her perfect life is suddenly out of control. She's shunned by her former friends at school, her mother kicks her out of the house, she's forced to live in a run-down motel that's now a shelter, and she's not sure she'll be able to attend college at all.

9780141326122,"The Bunker Diary is a brilliantly written novel. This is the first book I've read by Kevin Brooks, and I have to say that he's a very talented author. The synopsis caught my attention for this novel. It seemed mysterious and creepy. I was intrigued to find out more. So I bought it and started reading straight away. Right from the beginning The Bunker Diary was a page turner. I was up 'till all hours reading. It had such a mysterious story line, and I couldn't put it down. A very gripping novel during the beginning. But about halfway through the book the story line started to get a bit bland. I was always expecting something to happen, something big, but nothing did. Very clever, Kevin Brooks. But not clever enough. You everything was building up for a climax, but we were disappointed. You left us stranded. And that's when The Bunker Diary started to bore me. ""I thought he was blind. That's how he got me."" It was at that point, halfway through the book, that I realised that there weren't any twists, and it didn't look like there would be. The situation the characters were in didn't seem to be changing one bit. But I still had that little bit of hope that the ending would make up for this. That Kevin Brooks purposefully kept us waiting for a spectacular finale. I was wrong. The ending left me disappointed and quite disturbed. It was a very unsatisfying ending. I felt empty after finishing The Bunker Diary. If there was even an epilogue to give us some closure. It was very disappointing and left me feeling pretty bad, because I probably would have liked the book a lot better if the ending was a satisfying one. Why? We never found out the answer to that question in the story. Why were six people kidnapped and placed in a bunker, trapped? Was it just a sadistic man trying to have some fun? Was it a cult rebelling against the community? We'll never know, and it kills me. It kills me because I had hoped that we would at least have been left with an explanation for the mysterious story line. Kevin Brooks, why? Why didn't you give us a proper ending? ""He's watching us."" The Bunker Diary was extremely disturbing and creepy. The idea of the story line sends chills down my spine. It's a phycological thriller that's actually quite scary at times, just the overall idea of the situation in the story. And the ending made it all the more disturbing. It was realistic novel, but I would've like to have a little insight to the after-effects of the story. The characters in The Bunker Diary are brilliantly developed. Especially the main character, Linus, who narrated the novel through the writing in his diary, hence the title. Their personalities were realistic and that made it a much more enjoyable read. I liked the diverse personalities Brooks included in the story. Again, it made everything more realistic. Overall, The Bunker Diary is a disturbingly chilling novel. Not my favourite, because of the frustrating ending, but can't deny that it was a page turner. Kevin Brooks writing style is truly amazing and I admire the way The Bunker Diary was written. The Bunker Diary is not the kind of book that you read again and again, it's a one-read-wonder.",Jack

We find out more about the powers of the teens and Maya has no choice but to face what she realized about herself, That she has healing powers over animals and that she shape shifts into a cougar. She has always understood cats and had relationship with the animals, so much that she helps her dad with the hospital for wounded animals. Her friendship with Daniel was strong again in this one, and we see further proof that he is a leader, and has influence over them, Daniel is such a nice guy and I like his character. Rafe was in this one but we are in a lot of suspense with him and his sister and he's not really as big a character in the first part, We instead get a closer look at the others in the helicopter with them: Sam, Nicole and Corey. The action did start to pick up and threw in a lot of twists and surprises. There were betrayals and of course they never knew who was telling the truth and who was out to get them. Like the first, the book just kinda ended. I know that the third will pick right up, but its still hard not to get at least some closure. I mean I know why it stopped at sort of that place, but a little more or a little less would have been great. I will definitely read the last and excited to get time.

Sloane Price is suicidal and has no sense of self-preservation whatsoever. I find her interesting as the main character and narrator of the story because her thoughts and instincts go against everything that one is supposed to do in her situation. She's depressed and well, considering her past, it's not a surprise that she wants to just end everything for her even when the world around her is on the verge of ending, too. But despite her suicidal tendencies, Sloane possesses strength that she's not even aware of. And that's where the other characters come into the picture. Somehow, they all helped Sloane find her courage and heart to survive. The prose is really good and poignant. Courtney Summers knows how to use her words to maximum effect, whether the scene involves running away from zombies or making out with a boy in the locker room or just happening inside Sloane's head. Every page seeps with emotion that my heart practically aches for Sloane and all that she's lost. The writing is that vivid and effective. There's not much in character development though, because Sloane basically stays the same all throughout save for one major change in her towards the end. The other characters, too. (At least the ones who made it to the end.) Tragic is only one way to describe it but I guess that's what happens when the world, or at least your town, gets overrun by zombies. Not everyone makes it and the ones who do are never really safe. This is Not A Test is an ironic story of a girl who survived even when she didn't want to. And in surviving, she gets better and stronger, if not whole. A really good read.",Julie Rimpula
9780312656744,"Argh *zombie noises* Can zombies be excited about really great zombie books? Because if they could I bet they would be excited about this one. This Is Not A Test is a horror/zombie tale with a strong contemporary feel and somehow, that just works. With contemporary, I sometimes find myself a little bored as the pace feels slower. However This Is Not A Test kept up the contemporary tone and feel but also kept the action and sense of danger, despite the majority of the book being set in just one building. I would say this was one of the scariest zombie books I have ever read. My heart really went out for Sloane, her life was just rubbish, seriously. She was constantly being beaten up by her father, like seriously beaten up, the can't go to school because the bruises are showing type. On top of that her sister had recently run away and now there's actual real life (dead life?) zombies banging on the doors. She was so broken I wasn't sure we were going to make it to the end of the first couple of chapters with her, let alone the whole book. She had literally lost the will to live, in the worst possible time. The other characters had their own faults too, although I won't lie, I kept getting Cary and Rys mixed up at times. I felt that the most interesting person was Harrison, who was one of those wet type of guys who I would probably shoot first or use at bait during a zombie apocalypse. While he moans and complains about not having one anything in his short life, he won't do anything about it either. He's more than happy to follow around whoever he senses as the leader. However I didn't hate him as much as I hated Trace. He was damaged, having just lost his parents but his twin sister Grace didn't act anywhere near as much of a ass as he did. Every time he started getting at Cary it set my teeth on edge. At around 95% I was wondering how Courtney would end the book and if there would be unfinished questions or if she'd kill everyone off at that point but somehow in the little bit of extra percent left, she managed to finish off the story perfectly. There was unanswered questions but I felt like it ended in the right place. I enjoyed her writing style so much I went out the next day and bought two more of her books. I would happily read a sequel to this or more zombie books though...",Vickie Ramage
9780312656744,"tw: domestic abuse tw: suicide This was such a brutal book! For those expecting mindless zombie carnage, look somewhere else - yes, there is some of it in the book, but that's not its main focus. Instead, This is Not a Test focuses on people. On who they are, on how they react, on what that tells us about them. Our main character, Sloane, has lost the will to live. Is it the hopelessness of the Apocalypse, you ask? No, it's the hopelessness of being trapped with an abusive parent in a absolutely normal world. The hopelessness of being alone, since her sister and only friend, has left her alone with the abuser. So when the Apocalypse strikes, Sloane isn't particularly upset. It's merely a change of plans, she doesn't mean to hang around for long, this is just a another way to leave. But Sloane finds herself trapped in her high-school with other survivors: her former classmates with whom she never really connected. This was masterfully written. When abuse is addressed in books you seldom witness the loneliness, the inability to form relationships other people take for granted, because your life is defined by the abuse. Courtney Summers did not shy away from that. And while they all struggle to survive, and conflicts arise from living in such close quarters, Sloane sits quietly with her secret: she doesn't intend to survive.",Isa Vidigal
9780312656744,"It's so hard for me to talk about this book. I don't want to forget it, I don't want to read anything after this, I feel kind of numb actually, and I sure don't want... I don't even know what I want or don't want anymore. All I really do know is that This is Not a Test has touched me incredibly, and I seriously hope I'll never be in a situation like the one Sloane or any other character from the group, was. It's desperation to its maximum. It's constant fear. It's dealing with the unknown, with the infected ones, the starved ones, who will haunt you, hunt you, chase you and eat you at the first chance they get. This story is so well written, the characters are so astonishingly damaged and scared and lost, the plot is so damn emotional and raw and thrilling and mysterious... that anything can happen and everything undoubtedly will. I fell in love with Sloane at first line. I'm still in love with her. I'm still in love with Rhys, and Cary, and Harrison, and Grace, and even with Trace. I absolutely love them all, because every single one of them is special, was special, in their own way, and every single one of them served a purpose. Not all had a happy ending-or when you come to really think about it, they just might have had their happy ending-but they were certainly all memorable. Sloane for her numbness and persistence, Rhys for his passion and loyalty, Cary for his leadership and strength, Harrison for the innocent panicked comments and questions that somehow made me laugh even when they were not intended to be funny, Grace for her beauty and forgiving will, and Trace... Trace for his devotion to his sister and his beliefs and, of course, his edgy side that always kept me in alert mode. But more than just a book with remarkable characters, this is a story about tension, about sacrifice, guilt and about being unable to move on, to subsist, when all we care about and everyone we love are simply taken away from us. It's a book about will, about what's truly important, and more importantly, about survival. Nothing could have ever prepared me for the journey I was about to enter when I started this novel. Ingenuously, maybe, I thought I was going to read a cool book about zombies-I admit, I haven't read many living dead stories so my curiosity was really high-but this ends up being so much more than that. In fact, this is not a zombie book. This is a book about a group of kids who clearly have no idea or are even prepared for what just happened to them and to their city and that, somehow, have to manage to survive together... oh, and with some zombies in the mix. What I mean with this is that the zombies are just a small piece of this overwhelming puzzle, and although their presence is a heavy burden, they are not the main core of the book or the reason-in my opinion-why this story was written. I will always cherish this book deeply. I felt it in my bones, with my entire being, and whenever I had the opportunity to turn some pages, I would go completely oblivious to the world. I would hear nothing, see nothing, and speak nothing. Gosh, what a powerful experience this reading was! It's so wonderful when, a day or two later, you can still sense the characters around you, sense the pressure they were under, and still think about them like they were real to you, like they exist. To me, that's the most gratifying gift an author can give me. At the end of the day, I just wish I was Sloane's sister and that Lily would continue to be a ghost in her life. I wish I knew what happens next, 'cause that ending was literally to die for. I guess, ultimately, I just wished there was more, because I need more, I want more. Absolutely amazing.",Patricia Pilar Pecegueiro
9780312656744,"Zombie books seem to be growing in popularity and that's something that I have no complaints about! I've mentioned before that I have a certain weakness for zombie films, and books are no exception to this. But what I found particularly intriguing about This Is Not a Test is how the zombie storyline serves more as a backdrop to the real story; which deals much more with Sloane's personal growth and development than anything else. That's something largely unexpected in a zombie book, but it does make for something new. It does a fantastic job of questioning who the real zombies are - the killer undead wandering around outside, or the absolutely broken and shattered living girl who can't feel anything? Reasons to Read: 1.A zombie book with depth: Like I mentioned above, it's really great to see that there's so much more to this than just undead humans trying to kill living people (with some good old government conspiracy thrown in). Sloane is desperately unhappy and angry; quite frankly, she really isn't concerned with her survival at all. Which makes it rather interesting to throw her into a survival scenario. And it's so enriching to see what the motives are behind her actions, and the changes which take place to her as her situation moves along. And it's especially interesting because Sloane doesn't feel like she's really missing out on anything with the zombies taking over- her life wasn't any better before that happened. 2.Realistically scary: Even though the zombies don't play a huge role in the story, they do create a very effective setting just by being there - it's like a looming dark shadow over the entire plot. And the fact that everything is so still, so quiet for such a long time it just makes the reader more anxious for that JUMP moment. And there are so many other dark, frightening aspects to it that add to the overall ambiance - it's impossible to escape. But these other aspects are ones we can easily relate to because they're so familiar to our society and happen all the time (as unfortuante as it is). That feeling of loneliness and losing those we care about - that's terrifying. But unfortunately, I found that there wasn't quite enough development of the story for it to really appeal to me as a reader. I applaud Courtney Summers for being able to create a rich zombie book with so much more going on than zombies - but I also have to admit that I was expecting a bit more action, and to identify with the main character both of which I found to be areas lacking. I wasn't particularly taken with many of the secondary characters either - it was understandable that they would be upset and angry, but it seemed like they were all working against each other in rather petty ways simply to get back revenge. Every character lacked an idea of what they needed to accomplish in the long-term, and ended up stuck on short term desires. Normally I would expect such heavy, dark books to move me but for whatever reason I found it far too difficult to root for any character because I just couldn't identify. And without that relationship, I couldn't LOVE the book although I can clearly see why so many others would. Courtney's talent as a writer is exceptional and beautiful; lovely imagery, and captivating words that draw you in. A zombie book that truly stands out among the rest- it even has a vaguely contemporary feel to it, which could make it appeal to a large group of readers. E-galley received from publisher for my honest review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9780312656744,"Courtney Summers delivers a unique take on zombies in her genre-bending book. Sloane's home life sucks with her abusive father. Sloane had her sister Lily to turn to, to love her, to support her, and to suffer with. They made a plan to escape their house together when Sloane turned 18. Except Lily breaks the promise, leaving Sloane to fend for herself. The abuse is so much that Sloane has no reason to have hope anymore. In the initial scenes of the book, it's evident how brutal her life has been, and she immediately garners sympathy. Even though what she wants to do isn't necessarily sympathetic, it's understandable. And when the zombies arrive, Sloane is elated; it's her chance to die. Then we're tossed into Cortege High School, where Sloane and five fellow students have barricaded themselves. It's frantic and desperate, at least to those five; Sloane is annoyed. Her plans were ruined, and now that she's been dragged to safety, she's even more frustrated. The thing is, she can't seem to find a way away from these people who want to live, and even when she has the chance to end her own suffering, she doesn't. Sloane is one of the most interesting characters I've read, but she's very challenging. She is obedient in every sense of the word. Because of her father, there's a sense of reluctance in her. She allows herself to be dragged to safety (where it would be easy for her to not), and she doesn't actively seek out her options for dying when she has the chance. Rather, she continues to follow what she believes is the right thing to do. To stay alive. Anything she could feel for herself has been taken away, physically and emotionally. That's part of why she's unable to actually go through with ending her life. Amid all of this, Sloane is likable; there's just enough hope inside her and just enough desire to move forward to make readers pull for her and believe she can survive. This is a powerful character-driven novel. Despite the zombie apocalypse occurring, what matters is not the undead coming alive but the living coming alive. Secondary characters are fully developed, and they each serve distinct purposes for Sloane. Summers excels in her use of subtlety to develop the characters. There are single lines or short scenes so raw they sting, and they speak volumes to who Sloane really is (who she is, not who she's told she is or who she has come to believe she is). The pacing in the book is deliberately slow, begging the reader to pay attention to these things. The story doesn't drag, though. Summers delivers on strong writing that doesn't try too hard and works to advance these characters. This is an extremely physical book. Each blow can be felt, as can each of the more tender moments. The book doesn't shy away from brutality nor from being gruesome; despite being heavily vested in reality, it's still a novel about the zombie apocalypse. I felt beat up and bruised reading this; fortunately, I had the same moments of hope and promise Sloane did throughout. There's a definite conclusion to come away with at the end of the book, and the way it's done is savvy. Sloane has to make a series of very difficult choices that force her to confront everything she's been so eager to shy away from. She'll revisit everything with Lily and her father and come to realize her body and her choices and her life are hers. So while this is a story of survival, it's also a story about what we fight for, and why we fight for things at all.",Kelly Jensen
9781250011916,"May contain spoilers Whispers at Moonrise is the fourth book in the Shadow Falls series. And with only one more book planned in the series, I know I'm going to be deeply saddened to leave this world which I've really enjoyed spending time in. Kylie is living at Shadow Falls, a camp for supernaturals. But Kylie isn't like the other kids at camp, she's not a vampire, or werewolf, or shifter, or fae. She's a chameleon, which means she has the DNA for many different types of supernatural. Not many chameleons exist and very little is known about them, so Kylie feels like a freak. She hasn't yet learned to control her changes so she's never sure what she's going to be at any one time. She's also a ghost whisperer which means she sees spirits and helps them to solve their problems so they can cross over. And if all that doesn't make her weird enough, she's also the first half blood protector. She gains amazing strength and speed when someone else is in danger but she can't protect herself in dangerous situations. Kylie has two amazing, hot guys vying for her attention. Derek who's fae and Lucas, a werewolf. When she appears to have made her choice, a whole new can of worms opens up and she's left miserable. She has two brilliant best friends, Miranda who's a witch and Della, a vampire, who she also shares a cabin with. The trio really care for and look out for each other. Kylie has an extremely close relationship with the camp leader, Holiday, a fae. Burnett is another camp leader, a vampire, who is crazy about Holiday. Kylie has been trying to get them together for a long time as she's sure Holiday feels the same but won't give in because she's been hurt before. But being a chameleon, so unusual and so powerful, brings with it it's own danger for Kylie. She's on the radar of a gang run by Mario, also a chameleon, who previously kidnapped her and wanted her to marry his grandson. He is ruthless, killing his own grandson when he tried to protect Kylie. And the FRU, kind of like the supernatural FBI, want to carry out tests/experiments on her, the same experiments that led to the death of her grandmother. Her grandfather wants to take her away to live with him so he can protect her and teach her what she needs to know to survive as a chameleon. She doesn't want to leave Shadow Falls as it feels like her home, the only place she belongs. Whispers at Moonrise is a brilliant instalment in the Shadow Falls series, maybe the best one yet. A killer is on the loose. Having already killed three girls, Holiday is next on his list. And with only the help of one of the dead girls, Kylie must try to find out who the killer is before time runs out. She's also dealing with her own problems of being on Mario's hitlist, trying to figure out more about being a chameleon and not feel like such a freak and, deal with the fact that she and Lucas are spending very little time together, the reason being, that the pack doesn't approve of her. From the very first book, this series reeled me in and has kept me riveted since. And now, with only one more to go, Chosen at Nightfall will be a bittersweet read. I can't wait to have it in my hands yet I don't want this series to come to an end.",Suzanne Finnegan

I loved it more than I can even say. I am a huge fan of the Shadow Falls series, and had waited too long to read this, (Ok I did the Audible audio book thing with my Kindle purchase) and if it wasn't for being able to listen to it on Audible, I would still be waiting. As I would be able to listen while doing housework, or other tasks that I could not do while reading, lol. I have so many tour books to read, I have to read them every-time I can actually read. Anyway, so happy I was able to do this. Fans of Shadow Falls will love this book, its funny how the series gets better and better, if that's even possible. I do not want to spoil anything, so will keep this short. I will say, I was disappointed to not get more of Derek, as he is my favorite guy by far, and I always thought he should be the one Kylie to be with, but after what Lucas does to Kylie, I really believe it even more. He is a JERK. Will not say more, if you read it, you will know why. If not, better get too it. lol. I loved how Kylie got to discover more on her powers and what it means to be what she is. I wont mention that either, as I worry someone will read this who had not read the last book at least, that spilled the big answer to what kind of supernatural Kylie is.

9780375846144,"Before I start the story that is Nick and Norah, I decided we needed to get some misconceptions out of the way first. 1) I don't live in Manhattan, so I won't understand what the characters are talking about. Wrong! I don't live in Manhattan--actually, I've never been farther East than Ohio, but I still got the gist of the story quite easily. Sure, I might never have visited Times Square, but I've been on the Square in my hometown (population 3,400), and the same types of things went on there that go on in New York. 2) This book is full of cursing. Right! And if you haven't heard a lot of curse words (do I really need to spell them out?), especially from the mouths of teens, in the last twenty years or so, I'm guessing you live on a commune somewhere in the middle of Utah. 3) This book only covers one night. Right again! And oh, what a night it is! One night, filled with all the ups, downs, and sideways that being a teen in todays world brings. Now that we've got that out of the way, we can concentrate on the story. It's about Nick, a bassist for a band with an ever-changing name, who recently had his heart broken by a b***h named Tris. It's about Norah, an uber-complicated girl with more issues than The National Enquirer, who not too long ago had her virginity broken by Tal. And then there's Caroline, and Jessie, and Uncle Lou, not to mention Dev and Thom, and Randy from Are You Randy?, and Hunter from Hunter. There's beer, and there's drugs, and there's sex, although none of it is Nick or Norah's. There's heartbreak, and devastation, and lust, and forgiveness, and acceptance. There's parents to deal with, and friends to attempt to deal with, and a boy and a girl who wish that, just once, they could be themselves and not deal at all. There's a love story, and a song about a girl on a street in the middle of the night, and a band that just might make it big, and a car that won't start, and a subway ride that requires jumping the turnstyle. There's love, and anger, and disappointment, and desperation, and redemption. There's life, and then there's Nick and Norah. There's a story here, and you need to read it.",TeensReadToo

The last year and a half has been hard on Macy. After witnessing her father's death after a Christmastime morning run, she's strived to be the ""fine just fine"" girl--a perfect helper for her mother, a perfect balance to her older sister Caroline's wild days, and a perfect girlfriend to her genius boyfriend. But when Jason heads off to Brain Camp for the summer and unexpectedly asks for a ""break"" in their relationship, Macy's world is thrown even more off-kilter. She'd already committed to taking Jason's place at the Library Information Desk for the summer, and she hates the job, and the Miss Perfection girls she gets snubbed by on a daily basis. Her evenings are spent dutifully studying for her SATs the following year, and even her weekends are filled with helping her mother with her business and ironing her clothes for the week. Then, during a party her mother throws for prospective clients, Macy meets the staff members of Wish, a chaotic catering business. Delia, the very pregnant owner; Kristy, the scarred girl in the outrageous outfits; Monica, the Queen of the One Word Answer; Bert, who's convinced the end of the world is near; and Wes, a boy who spent time in reform school after his parent's divorce and then lost his mother to cancer. During this particular summer, Macy comes to realize that being the perfect daughter, sister, and girlfriend doesn't stop the world from being a crazy place. It doesn't insulate you from hurt. In fact, being spontaneous, creating new friends, looking outside the shell of a perfect existence, is the only way to realize the truth about forever--it can be two seconds long, or a hundred years. The moment you're living now is your forever, and Macy finally learns how to reach out and grab the moment. I really loved this book! Although touted as a YA read, I think any woman would enjoy it. It's sad, humorous, and compelling, a definitely wonderful read. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

Some like Seth are funny and adventurous, while his sister is more cautious and careful, yet there qualities both mix together in their adventures. I also like all the mythical creatures. I love myth, so having all those different mythical creatures in there made me giddy with joy. I also love all the different preserves they visit and how each one was very different than the next.

9781416947202,"It's very rare, in this day and age of Harry Potter mania (and yes, I admit I'm a very devoted victim!) to find a fantasy story that can actually hold your attention. With FABLEHAVEN, though, new author Brandon Mull manages to do just that from the very first page to the last. Not to mention, thank the fairies, that there's already another book planned in the series. The premise is simple enough: two siblings, thirteen-year-old Kendra and her eleven-year-old brother, Seth, are relegated to spending time with their paternal grandparents, Grandma and Grandpa Sorenson, while their parents enjoy a seventeen-day Scandinavian cruise. At first glance, that might not seem so strange, but you have to understand that their family's relationship with the grandparents Sorenson is sort of an odd one. They don't visit much, they don't call; in fact, Kendra and Seth don't really know their grandparents that well at all. This is a forced, mandatory vacation though, so the kids don't have much choice in the matter. And when they finally reach Fablehaven, where, unbeknown to them, their Grandfather is the caretaker, they're a little overwhelmed. First, there were the No Trespassing and Private Property signs that gave way to one that said Certain Death Awaits. Now, they find out that however pretty and secluded Fablehaven may be, there's no television, no radio, and a ton of rules -- not all of which make sense. What follows is two weeks of more adventure, trouble, suspense, and magic than the kids could have ever dreamed of. When their rash actions, and disobedience to some important rules, leads to retribution from the magical world of Fablehaven, Kendra, Seth, Grandpa Sorenson, and even Grandma, who seems to be missing, are in for a ride. FABLEHAVEN is a great fantasy novel perfect for everyone, from young adults to those young at heart. With a cast of characters ranging from witches to fairies, satyrs to imps, strange chickens and conniving trolls, there's definitely something for everyone. I plan to give my copy of FABLEHAVEN to my ten-year-old son to read next, and I'm pretty sure he'll enjoy it as much as I did (not to mention my mom, who gets it when he's done!).

9780399162411,"This. Book. Rocked. Like, seriously. The 5th Wave is all about the end of the world--alien style. But there's no little green men in space suits, no shiny flying saucers with laser beams, no ""Take me to your leader."" This is not Area 51, people. It's much worse. Cassie lives in a world where the only person you can trust is yourself. She has survived the first four waves of the invasion (whether by good luck or incredibly bad, she can't decide), and she's on a mission to keep the most important promise she's ever made. She's smart, resourceful, and she does what she has to do to survive: shoot first and get emotional about it later. Because you see, The Others, they look just like us and Cassie's not entirely sure that there are any humans left other than herself. I have to give props to Yancey because this book kept me guessing, and that doesn't happen all that often. I'm all like: Who's an alien? Who's not an alien? Wait, I thought that guy was an alien. He is. He's not. I don't know. Ok, I know that guys is, so why is he doing that? Hold up, why do they want those? What are they going to do with them? What's that thing do? Wait, what just happened? What's the 5th Wave? Holy crap! That's the 5th Wave?! How sneaky and utterly evil! Aliens suck, I hope humanity kicks some serious arse! Man, I can't wait for the next book to come out! In the interest of not giving anything away, I'm going to quit while I'm ahead. I'm also going to emphasize how much I liked this book: A LOT. Tons. Thiiiiiiiiiiis Much. And, just for good measure, I'm going to throw in one of my favorite quotes, because if anything will make you want to read The 5th Wave, it's this quote :). Happy reading! ""I still could be the last human being on Earth. I might be--no, I probably am--doomed. But if I'm it, the last of my kind, the last page of human history, like hell I'm going to let the story end this way. I may be the last one, but I am the one still standing. I am the one turning to face the faceless hunter in the woods on an abandoned highway. I am the one not running, not staying, but facing. Because if I am the last one, then I am humanity. And if this is humanity's last war, then I am the battlefield.""",Diana

When the aliens arrived, they didn't respond to messages, their ship just hovered out in space, and Cassie chose to ignore them. Then came the EMP, and it was lights out. Then the aliens caused giant Tsunami's, and then a plague spread by birds. 98% of the world's human population dead. 16-year-old Cassie was lucky in that both her father and brother survived the first 3 waves, but now she's alone, and she's got one clear objective in her head - save her little brother from the aliens that took him from her. Can Cassie ever hope to save her little brother? Who is the silent assassin who is stalking her? And is this really the end for humanity? This was an interesting dystopian, with a sci-fi element, but I expected more. We started off following Cassie, and I liked her. She was fairly feisty and determined, and she gave her all for her family. Then we switch to some kid calling himself Zombie, which was pretty confusing. I didn't like Zombie as much, his depression and withdrawal from society made him difficult to really get a feel for. The story then jumped back and forth between Cassie and Zombie, and every time it happened I had trouble working out who I was now following (maybe this is cleared up with some editing in the final version?), this could be easily solved. Anyway, I liked the bits with Cassie, she was fighting for her survival, and trying to do the best by her family in a really stinky situation, but she never gave up hope. The bits with Zombie on the other hand got old quick. There was stuff about training - military training, stuff about micro-chips inserted into people, missions etc. and unfortunately I got bored of this really quick. I got so bored in fact that I put this book down to read two others whilst trying to get through it. I mean, I'm a big fan of dystopians, this one just bored me in places, which was a really shame after such a promising start. Maybe the hype spoilt this for me, I don't know, but I just didn't like this one as much as I expected. There was a bit of romance in this one quite strangely, although I did get a real deja vu vibe at one point that reminded me very strongly of a similar plotline in 'The Host'. I can't say that I was that big a fan of the romance in this one though, it didn't excite me, and if anything I was a little wary of trusting anyone in this dystopian world. I thought the plot was okay, and some of the ideas were quite clever, but the slower and more boring parts just dragged so much that they kinda ruined it for me. I have read quite a lot of dystopians, and this one for me was pretty average. One annoying thing that I have just suddenly realised though, is that the aliens don't have bodies, they only have consciousness - they take over bodies (a bit like in 'The Host' only they don't even have that much physicality.) anyway, if they're planning on killing all the humans so they can have the planet to themselves, what are they going to live in? Are they going to use cockroach bodies or something? I mean realistically, if they kill all the humans, won't they have nothing to inhabit? And if they only have consciousness and no bodies, surely they don't need food, water etc. so what's the point? I'm puzzled by this. Overall; an interesting sci-fi/dystopian, but I expected more. 6.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781416963974,"Favourite Quote = ""The easiest lies to tell are the ones you want to be true."" I've been wanting to read this book for ages, and finally got around to it. It was not as good as I expected, but it was still good. I gave this book 3/5 stars and would recommend it to anyone! The first thing I liked about this novel was the world building, its not dystopian but it has a different government to ours because the 'curse workers' are know infamously around the world as supernatural criminals and laws must be made against them. I liked this different society thing it was very unique and it was the little things I loved the most, like how everyone wears gloves and other little details that are shared throughout the novel. The plot was fast-paced but I felt most of the time it was very predictable and I guessed most of the twists before they come. That being said, there were still twists that were a little shocking to me but not that many. This is mostly the reason I dropped this book a star. Far too predictable. But the overall plot was good. The reason I dropped a second star was because of the characters. I only liked two of them, the main character Cassel and his grandfather. I liked Cassel's brother Barron at the beginning then hated him. Hated his other brother Philip, Lila reminded me of Alison from the Pretty Little Liars series a complete bitch, I didn't see the point in Sam, Daneca and Audrey they were just boring and not needed. Sorry that paragraph seems a bit of a rant because it was, I mean who loves books that have mostly horrible characters? The ending leaves on a shocking twists, one of the few I didn't guess and I will probably read the next book however I believe if the author never put this twist in this book could have been a stand alone, and I think it would be better if it had been.",brookexx
9781416963974,"We are thrown into the world of con games and introduced to the supernatural powers one single touch can have. Black invented many new super powers like influencing luck and manipulating memories to show off in White Cat . The world of cons and games is very complex, offering various talents to keep the reader entertained . It 's prevailing mood is dark and mysterious. With ""White Cat"", Black chose a very interesting title for her novel. The word constellation itself is simple and bland, but readers will really appreciate it in the end. Seeing it in front of the whole story White Cat has a special meaning, it is the best title she could have chosen, because a small white cat is the essence, the mystery and the key to a main secret. The protagonist Cassel is thoughtful and shy. One would say he is plain, boring, others would state that he has a tormenting secret. Cassel is a murderer... he murdered his best friend, but has no idea how and especially why he should have done this. Thinking of himself as a murderer, it turns out that Cassel has the most interesting talent in the con world. Murder case Lila could lend Cassel new undreamt of powers or could destroy his life, everything and everyone he believed in. The more Cassel questions the murderer of his best friend Lila, the more the story picks up speed. I liked his character and the mystery always circling around him. The plot line I was most interested in was the relationship between Cassel and ,his best friend and victim, Lila. This main relationship is replenished with various small plot lines and interactions of Cassel's and Lila's family members. I fell in love with Cassel, but got sometimes even annoyed about his family and their long-winded subplots. Chapter by chapter, Black reveals more details about Cassel's secret, the murder of Lila, family backgrounds and intrigues. She applies a very highbrow style of writing to create a wonderful and thrilling start to the complex Curse Workers series. Holly Black is a witty and talented author, she left me screaming in the end, when I realised that I became the victim of a con myself! THE VERDICT White Cat is a gloomy story about a family that isn't really what she pretends to be, and a boy that has to find out who he really is, seamed with hatred, intrigues and crime. Go get White Cat and let the masterly con begin!",MissPageTurner
9781416963974,"I didn't expect something more than a light, quick summer reader when I picked up this book. One of the many that cropped up after the ""magic"" frenzy that has taken the world lately. However, the characters are well written and the plot is full of twists and turns. It's like a personal narration as the whole book is written in the first person and that succeeds in stirring up strong emotions. The main character, Cassel, is tragic yet promising and he develops greatly over time. I particularly liked the parts where he insisted on telling himself that he's not a good guy. A fun read.

9781423113386,"I started to read this book to my fifth graders, but it is long and the end of the year crept up on us and we didn't get to finish it. So I took it home and finished it myself. I loved it. There are two main characters, Sadie and Carter Kane. They are brother and sister, but they are almost strangers to each other. When Sadie was 6 and Carter 8, their mother died and because of a bitter custody dispute, Sadie went with her mother's parents in London and Carter stayed with his dad. They only see each other two times a year. Carter travels with his father, an Egyptologist, and is home schooled, while Sadie goes to a public school in London. They really don't have much to say when they see each other. One Christmas Eve, Carter and his father pick up Sadie and go to the British Museum for a research project. While there, Mr. Kane destroys the Rosetta Stone and unleashes five Egyptian gods into the world. He is entombed and leaves Carter and Sadie saddled with a mission to stop the god, Set, from destroying the world. Many other reviewers have said that they couldn't tell the differences between Carter and Sadie's voices, but I could. Sadie was brash while Carter is more polite. They complimented each other in many ways. I loved getting two different points of view as I read. Another character that I loved was Bast, the cat goddess, who took the form many times of Muffin, Sadie's cat. She was funny and you could tell she really loved the children. I had a little problem with the Egyptian mythology (I fell in love with Greek myths when I was younger), but enjoyed learning about it. I can't wait to read the next installment of THE KANE CHRONICLES! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781423113386,"Being part way through Percy Jackson and the Olympians series (by the same author) I was really looking forward to reading The Red Pyramid. The tale is narrated by the two main characters, Sadie and Carter Kane, generally in chunks of two chapters and although on occasion I forgot who's turn it was, it was easy enough to remember as each page is marked with who's talking. I really liked both characters and the idea of them hardly knowing each other but having a natural sibling bond allows the reader to get to know them throughout the book as they reconnect with each other. The story itself follows a similar style to the Percy Jackson books, with Sadie and Carter having a set time in which to reach their destination and complete their task, along the way running into various Gods, creatures and magicians who are trying to stop them. The main difference I found was that while I have a basic knowledge of Greek mythology (and so was able to second guess some of the Percy Jackson plots), I had no prior knowledge about Egyptian mythology before reading The Red Pyramid. It was fun to learn about it as I read the book as it made the story more than just an adventure. I have to admit I got a little confused with some of it at times, although I don't believe that was anything to do with the author or the writing. I think Egyptian mythology just is confusing - even the characters were confused at points! The Red Pyramid is an exciting adventure story, combined with a fun way to find out about the Egyptians. a recommended read, especially if you're looking for a book for reluctant boy readers.",Tasha
9780399256752,"Completely action packed Legend kept me turning page after page without a break. I can't believe I waited so much time to read it, seriously, this book has been in my TBR for more than 6 months and now that I finally picked it up I just want to kick myself for waiting so long! Marie Lu's writing style is unique, fresh, exhilarating and voracious. She always managed to kept my attention focused on the characters, their surroundigs and the action. Lots of action. But let me clarify this, when I say action I mean two types. First the type that has bombs, guns, fighting and a lot of running. And then the type that has a lot of things going on no-stop, you know? The kind that doesn't let you breath and you are every so often opening your mouth in a big O and muttering things like ""what?! how... when... what?!"" or my favorite ""*speachless* *gasp* *faning myself*"" while my sister asks ""What? What happened? You have to tell me!!!"" 'Cause, you know, we spent this weekend together and she doesn't like to read as much as I do so I have to tell her the whole book in parts. Let's just say she loved my short version as much as I loved the book, hahaha. I enjoyed to see the story from Day and June's POV; both of them gave depth to the plot in every page and their voices felt as real as life itself. In fact I would do anything to have the chance of reading Prodigy, the second book, right away. I want to know what happens next, I want to fight alongside them and help them unravel the truth. I desperately want to share more moments in their company and get to know them better. So yes, as you can tell I recommned this book a lot.

9780399256752,"In the words of Barney Stinson, this book is LEGEN...wait for it...DARY - and it definitely does not disappoint if you have been anxiously salivating for LEGEND since Kristin Nelson first mentioned it early 2011. Each page will grip you by the shirt and pull you deeper into this strange America where everything seems to function on cleverly-disguised lies. Who to trust, who to believe, who to discard, who to protect, is there anyone who is genuine enough to do the right thing after learning the truth? THE GOOD BITS {Reminescent of Ender's Game and Divergent} There are good books, and there are GREAT books that leave you feeling exhilarated after reading them - and it is always thrilling to discover new books like LEGEND that fall ahead of the curve. ENDER'S GAME is one of my gold standards, and I am more than happily surprised to discover 2 books this year that come close to its greatness. There is something riveting about having child prodigies discover that their adult superiors may be manipulating them and enact in a fit of rebellion. {Day and June} I loved how well these two main characters played off each other. Although they came from different backgrounds, they both came to the chessboard with equal intelligence and resourcefulness. As much as I love Day, I will have to say that I favor June more. Most likely because she happens to be a girl who can kick butt both physically and mentally, but also because I think that LEGEND turned out to be more about June. Day may have greeted me at page 1 and had some problems of his own, but in my opinion, June did more of the dirty work of avenging her brother's death, going undercover to sniff out Day's whereabouts, learning the real truth about the Republic, and deciding whose side she wants to be on. THE BAD BITS {Not enough world-building} I had been hoping that LEGEND would go into how exactly North America split into two warring factions. While there is mention of the Republic and the Colonies, it does not come with a whole lot of details attached. LEGEND focuses more on the corruption within the Republic, and while that is all fascinating, how do the Colonies play into this? I am hoping the answers lie within the next book, especially considering Book 1 leaves Day and June on the very edge of new and even bigger chessboard. THE OVERALL LEGEND is well worth the wait - whether you read it now or wait until the rest of the series releases. Marie Lu has crafted a new world that stems from the familiar and branches into something wholly innovative. Smart, sensational, and oh-so-sicker-than-slick, LEGEND contains nothing but the best parts - and if a movie is in the making, all I have to say is: GAME ON!",theEPICrat
9780399256752,"In Legend, fifteen-year-old June is a highly intelligent member of the government. She has a great job and a very attentive brother. However, her life changes the day her brother dies. She's been told that he was a killed by Day. June decides to capture Day, who is basically uncapturable. However, things turn out different than what she expected when she finally finds him. Legend has everything that I love in a story. The plot is action-packed and filled with unexpected twists. I found myself surprised with some of the events that happened in the story. They were surprising and shocking. I'll admit that I was heartbroken by some if the things that happened to some characters. Legend had quite a gloomy atmosphere, but it went perfectly with what the dystopian genre is about. This was one of the best books in the genre I've read this year. The setting was exciting, as it is a controlled city like no other I've ever read about. Also, the pacing of the story was perfect. I found myself reading this book in no time, as I wanted to know what would happen next throughout the story. One of the aspects that I enjoyed the most about the story was the narration. I loved that Legend was told by both June and Day. It was great to get into the mind of both main characters. I loved getting to know each and what made them act the way they did. Day was such an awesome character. I loved him because he was a guy with a tortured past. He did the things he did to survive and help others, and I found it sweet. June was a great character. I enjoyed seeing her grow stronger through the book, even though she was kick-ass from the beginning. I liked seeing her change once she realized how bad things were. Even though she was strong from the start, June's change was noticeable through her actions and decisions. I loved each and every one of them. Overall, I enjoyed this book greatly. It's definitely one of the best in the dystopian genre. Legend is a thrilling ride from start to finish. This book is a must for dystopian fans.

9780399256752,"Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, the world of Legend is both oddly familiar and completely foreign. The United States no longer exists, and the western states have been enveloped into a new governmental entity known as the Republic - a militaristic state ruled by the ever-elected Elector Primo and Congress. Individual freedoms have been severely limited by the government and every citizen, at the age of 10, is required to take a trial or a test that will determine the course of one's life from that day forward. If a child scores high enough they will be granted a college education and a promising future with the Republic. If too low a score, the child will be sentenced to a life of dangerous menial labor, poverty and possibly infection by plague. Those who fail the test completely are sent to labor camps, all in service of the glorious Republic and Our Father, the Elector Primo. Day is a boy who failed the test, a boy who knows firsthand the truth about what happens to the children who don't pass the the Republic's trial. Having escaped his fate, he now creates as much trouble for the Republic as he can by destroying military property, stealing supplies, and hindering the war effort against the Colonies. He steals, bets, and scrounges to survive on the streets, constantly on the watch for Republic patrols who consider him enemy number one. Intelligent, intuitive, confident, and endearingly cocky, Day is a hero and a symbol of hope for the Republic's less fortunate. Day's primary concern though is caring for his family who, with the exception of his brother John, think him dead. He checks in on them from afar, provides for their needs when he is able and receives updates on their situation from John. When his family's front door is suddenly marked as infected by the plague patrols, Day is consumed by one goal only, an objective that will lead him down an irretraceable path. June, on the other hand, was born into a life of privilege. On her tenth birthday she aced the Republic's trial becoming the only child to ever receive a perfect score. Now, the Republic's golden girl, she is receiving the best education possible, being prepared for a much-anticipated military career in service to Elector and country. Incredibly bright and often bored with her studies, June is something of a troublemaker at her university, challenging herself to new heights of achievement with stunts that are frowned upon by school officials. However, once her brother is murdered, June is pulled out of training and put into the field. No one has been able to catch the elusive miscreant-turned-murderer known as Day, and if anyone has a chance of catching him June's superior officer is betting on the Republic's vengeance-seeking, star pupil. In addition to being extremely intelligent, June also displays a fierceness, a strategic mind, a sense of decency, and a hyper-intuitive eye. She is tough as nails, but she has a complete love for and an unshakable loyalty to her brother. Because of this vulnerability - this decision to love her family above the State - June becomes more likeable and more than just another mindless, propaganda-spouting drone. For readers who appreciate a strong, independent female lead, June is sure to please. One of the recurring themes that appear in dystopian novels seems to be that of the state vs. the individual. It's fascinating how a group of people, such as the Republic soldiers, can be indoctrinated to the point that their compassion for the individual is no longer a factor in their thought process - that a single human life or multiple lives can be stolen without a second thought, without any empathy at all. The Republic pawns have been robbed of their conscience, or perhaps they consciously choose to ignore that little nagging doubt, so that they may instead enjoy power, privilege and safety. It just never ceases to amaze how people can go along with such atrocities so blindly, and more horrifyingly perhaps, believing in the rightness of their actions. The overall blind devotion to the State, the unwillingness or inability for independent analytical thought, the substitution of the government modus operandi for one's personal/religious moral code is terrifying, and Lu communicates this very effectively. In addition to the wonderful characters and the interesting themes, the plot of this story is also very compelling. While not, perhaps the most complicated of mysteries when all is said and done, it's woven together well, and half the enjoyment of the mystery lies in the way that it's presented, is it not? It's well-paced, the danger is convincing and Lu is able to capture a real sense of gravity - a sense of helplessness and pain in the face of overwhelming odds - and it propels the reader through this story with the hope that June and Day will somehow be able to overcome the obstacles they face. Told in tandem by June and Day, Legend is yet another book that employs a shift in first-person narrator from chapter to chapter. And it is another book that uses the device quite well, as the reader is given a front row seat to June and Day's thoughts and motivations. Overall, Legend is dystopia well done. A fantastic debut that's bound for the keeper shelf.",Dani @ Refracted Light
9780399256752,"Legend by Marie Lu is AWESOME!! I really liked the flow that Marie Lu vividly illustrated through her well written story. I was surprised on how deeply engaged I was because I had my doubts with the simplicity of its cover, but within that cover there is nothing simple about it. Rich in action, intrigue, and suspense, a dystopian novel that will keep you awake through all hours of the night. Legend beckons you and I can't help but to ask for more! Daniel ""Day"" Altan Wing took his trials when he was only 10 years old. Every kid in the Republic takes their trials at 10. It decides whether they will be placed in the higher rankings of society or be one among the back breaking laborers living in the slums. And Day was among those who failed. With poor results he was taken into the labor camps along with the other children who didn't receive high scores. The twist is, there isn't such a thing as the labor camps. And all those who went, never came back or seen again. June is the prodigy of the Republic. She is the only one who scored a perfect 1500 on her trials. A bright future is ahead for her; and at such a young age (15 years) she's already a well decorated officer. Everything runs smoothly for June until Day comes along and kills her older brother, Metias. Left with no parents and now her brother, she begins her agenda of bringing down the Republic's elusive criminal, Day, and she's going to make sure he's going to get what he deserves. Legend by Marie Lu alternates from Day's voice to June's, but you will never mistake who your reading. Along with each character having their own designated color text, Day's being gold text and June's being black, each of the two is a distinct character with two complete different voices. I am amazed on how fluid I read Legend. It doesn't skip a beat; when June stops her tale Day picks it right back up where she left off. Another favorite I will add to my collection. I am on the edge of my seat eager for Legend's sequel!! I RECOMMEND!!",SpadesHigh

Ava, Caitlin, Mackenzie, Julie, and Parker all have reason to hate Nolan Hotchkiss, who has wronged every one of them in some way. But when he turns up dead, they are all suddenly suspects, even if they know they didn't kill him. Who killed Nolan? And is someone trying to frame the girls for murder? This was an enjoyable story, and it was quite reminiscent of 'Pretty Little Liars'. I liked the characters in this book, even if they made some misguided decisions! I felt really sorry for Caitlin over what had happened to her brother, and what Nolan did to Ava was so mean! Parker seriously had cause for complaint when it came to Nolan, and Mac had also been mistreated by him. The girls did make some poor decisions at times though (they obviously haven't read the pretty little liars series), and seemed to just get in more and more trouble as the book went along! The storyline in this was good, and I did enjoy this book. It was quite reminiscent of 'Pretty Little Liars', but it wasn't exactly the same. I did initially find it a bit difficult to keep up with so many different characters, but after a while I got them all straight in my head. I liked the little twists, and at times I even liked the stupid things that the girls did, it certainly livened the story up! The mystery element definitely kept me turning the pages, and I loved the uncertainly over the girls personal lives as well. There was some romance, but with 5 girls, not to mention their respective boyfriends and love interests, there were at least 2 love triangles happening in this book! The ending to this didn't really clear much up. Very little was resolved, and we were left with more than one cliff-hanger.

9780141309750,"I first read this book at least eight years ago. I found it at the library, and went to my local book store and had them order it in for me. This is the story of Harry Crewe who finds herself leaving home after the death of her father, and entrusted in the care of her brother Richard - who she has not seen for several years. Soon after arriving in Damar, the outpost Richard is posted to, strange and interesting things begin to happen, and she soon finds herself caught up in events that will change everything. In more recent novels, magic has become something of a tool. Take Harry Potter for example, it's a you do this, you say that, and the pin has turned into a duck. In this book, magic is more an uncertain force that can make you act, even if you are most unwilling. This is an excellently realistic fantasy novel, with a heroine you can be proud of - she is not one of these wussy heroines who seem to populate so many novels. The world is expertly created, no need to suspend your disbelief here, you do so automatically as everything seems perfectly reasonable and believable as you read it. The book is rich in detail, and as it continues, draws you in until you are completely absorbed. I believe the first time I read this, I read it cover to cover in a day (thankfully it was a weekend, otherwise my teachers might have had something to say about that).",Julie Cooke
9781780620312,"I really enjoyed this book! Zoe is such a fascinating character. Right off the bat, she tells you that she's a murderer, so naturally you shouldn't like her. But she writes the letters in such a brutally honest way that I couldn't help but loving her. Zoe doesn't explain the details of the murder until the end, which was perfect, since the story really isn't about that night. It's about the relationships built and shattered during the months leading up to it. This is a great YA contemporary where the family dynamics are just as important as the teenage relationships. I completely loved and connected with Zoe's family. They were just so real and engaging. The narrative structure was interesting too. The entire story is written in a compilation of letters. She uses Stuart as a soundboard to come to terms with everything that's happening now and everything she can't change. This story might not be the happiest, but it's so wonderfully done. It takes the YA Contemporary genre and spins it in a thought provoking gut-wrenching sort of way.",Ryann Dannelly
9780062072047,"I had the chance to read this novel before going to the event and I must say I enjoyed it. I am not much of a dystopian reader though I have enjoyed many titles such as the Juliette Chronicles, The Hunger Games Trilogy and The Maze Runner Trilogy. Under the Never Sky is a fascinating read. Technology such as the Smarteye is something that many have dreamed of. Ita??s like Google Glass, but more efficient. Living in the world of Reverie for Aria, I wouldna??t mind doing so. The idea of living in a false realm kind of excites me but also makes me question whether in our fast paced world, we would end up having this idea of false worlds become a reality and it could either be beneficial or a total scare. One thing that is most interesting about this novel is the ability of some of the characters to have heightened senses. For example, Seers can see farther and clearer at night, Auds can hear the most inaudible of sounds and even listen to your thoughts once physical contact has been initiated and then there are Scires, who can smell scents like animals and even smell emotion and tempers of a person. Only those in the Tides or outside of Reverie can genetically have this ability. It must be awesome to have a certain ability such as those living in the Tides. And Perry is lucky to have two of these abilities. Makes me envy a character with a passion. HAHA. There is a way in which Veronica Rossi is able to convey certain intricacies in the novel without making it too difficult to comprehend. There are some novels that are way too taxing to read because there are words that are way too difficult to understand or metaphors and the likes are way too much. But with Veronicaa??s work, I didna??t find much complexity like I thought I would which made me enjoy this novel very much. What I woulda??ve wanted out of the first novel is a better introduction to supporting characters like Roar or Liv, but I guess thata??s because ita??s a trilogy and I would still need to read the rest of it before I can truly say something. But still, I woulda??ve enjoyed knowing more about Roar or Ariaa??s mother in the first novel. By the way, Roar is like a piece of Kenji that I cana??t quite get a grip of myself when reading the parts with him in it. For sure, there is more to look forward to in the two other novels and I couldna??t wait to invest in those other two novels.

9780062072047,"When I picked up UNDER THE NEVER SKY and was a few pages into the story I thought I'd never get accustomed to this strange new world Veronica Rossi created. People living in domes, prevented from going to the outside and 'living' their lives in realms, virtual worlds to entertain their minds, never experiencing life in its full expanse. On the outside there are Savages who live in tribes without any culture or morals as Aria has always been taught. Aria's story is set long after humanity as we've known it was destoryed. The world collapsed in on itself and so called Aether storms have taken over most of the land, leaving fiery destruction in their wake. Fights for territories with other tribes as the struggle to gain power within your own are inevitable. The clash of advanced technology and tribal, very basic formations of life was a subject I often had to renegotionate throughout the story because the gap between them was so enormous. A rather minor thing that irritated me were the remainders of ancient culture that popped up at some points during the story. Old pieces of art or inventions are mentioned by Aria and I kept wondering about how she or anyone else would have had the time to remember or cherish them when entire cities were being destroyed. Who cared for such things when people fought for survival? It's very trivial but they somehow weakened the authentic feel about the world building I slowly and steadily warmed up to. The dual point of view from which the story was told, Aria the Dweller and Perry the Savage, came unexpected and it took me some time to get used to Perry's side of the story for I feared I wouldn't be able to pay much interest to his tribal life. I was surprised myself that it didn't took very long for me to get completely sucked into the story and I wouldn't have wanted to miss one of their perspectives on the events. I'm always for love stories between very extreme characters who represent total opposites and different worlds, so you can guess Aria and Perry's love story was what made UNDER THE NEVER SKY an even more fabulous read. They fight, they curse and hurt each other, therefore the making up in the end is even that much more pleasurable. UNDER THE NEVER SKY felt so much like a miniature version of Game of Thrones. With only one story to follow instead of numerous different ones but no less compelling in its intensity. 4,5/ 5 ****/* UNDER THE NEVER SKY - A miraculous and dangerous new fantastical world to get lost in! Just make sure to be found by Perry, he's the best guide! It's been a long time since I've discovered a dystopian world as unique as Veronica's world under the never sky. Aria, Perry and their friends (Roar is one of my favourites, too) will be staying with me for a long time and I could barely contain my excitement to press the order button for THROUGH THE EVER NIGHT.",MissPageTurner

I've been dying to read it from my blogger friends' recommendations and Goodreads review. Who doesn't want to read that high-rated book? (Confession: I barely even read the description. Just an enthusiastic recommendation + high-rated reviews is all it takes for me to say yes. Typical me.) And whenever I visit the bookstore, I ALWAYS pick this book and stare at it longingly and be like, ""Oh, baby, I want you home. Too bad I still can't right now. Maybe some day soon. Very soon."" Don't kill me for not buying it ASAP, I'm broke that time (the most common and hateful problems of bookworms). When I FINALLY(!!!) get a chance to grab a copy (sniffs til there's no bookish smell left) and read it, I feel like stepping back. That wasn't I expected. I didn't liked the first few chapters and I was lost. I didn't catch up on what's happening or what's in their world right away and I feel like crying. I thought what happened to Daughter of Smoke and Bone will happen to Under The Never Sky. I thought I would be completely disappointed (what happens for not reading the description. :/). As I read on (which I thankfully do. But I'd do anyway even if it sucks because I'll feel sorry for my money), I get to learn about their world, acknowledge the impressive character and world building. I also began to like the story and be curious for the next events. All these stuff made me want for more from this book. And little did I realize, I'm falling for it. I've also fall for Aria's and Peregrine's love story and chemistry. I think I loved it because it's not an insta-love (which I know we all hate) and even if I know that they will fall for each other eventually, I'm still not prepared for all the feels. *sighs dreamily* Reading Under The Never Sky is really exciting. Most parts of the book were action-packed and no chapter left me bored. It gave me a lot to look forward to until I reach the very last chapter--and I still ask for more! I love how this book made me fall in love all over again with dystopian novels. I also love, love, love the ending I almost cried. It's not cliff-hanger, but you'd want to grab the second book right after you finish it (which I have to do really soon). The ending gave a fairytale-like touch that I really loved. It's my favorite part. I'd give this a full rating of five if not for the confusion I experienced at the beginning. I'd highly recommend this to all dystopian lovers. Who wants action + romance + mystery + many more. And simply to anyone who'd like to experience to be under the never sky.",Michelle Sedeno

9780525421580,"Two of today's most popular young adult authors have collaborated together on an entertaining journey into the lives of two characters, both named Will Grayson. Told in alternating chapters and voices, each Will Grayson is introduced to the reader. Each Will slowly reveals the inner workings of their minds. John Green's Will Grayson has bounced from his friend, Tiny Cooper, to a sporty group of friends, back to Tiny Cooper. Tiny is anything but Tiny. He's a hulking gay football player of a boy. Tiny is proud to be gay and is pushing to have the school let him put on his production Tiny Dancer: The Tiny Cooper Story. Tiny always puts Will in crazy or uncomfortable situations. Tiny is trying to set Will up with their friend, Jane. Will is attracted to Jane but can't bring himself to pursue her. On the other side of the city is David Levithan's Will Grayson. This Will is a loner. His only friend is an Internet buddy, Isaac, who lives in Ohio. There's Maura, a girl from school who thinks she's Will's friend, but Will finds her intrusive and bothersome. Maura is convinced Will is gay, but Will refuses to divulge anything personal to her. As the story develops, both Wills unexpectedly find themselves in the same bizarre porn shop in Chicago. Neither expected to be there, and when they realize they have the same name, they find themselves sitting outside trying to figure things out. Enter Tiny and Jane, and the night is about to get even more bizarre. Each author has a distinctive style, and it's quite easy to distinguish between the two while reading WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON. I found one of the author's Will Grayson characters much more appealing than the other, but both are well-written and have fascinating stories to share. But in all honesty, I thought Tiny Cooper stole the show! He's such a large character (pun intended) and deserves a novel of his own! If you're a fan of either Green or Levithan or both, WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON will surely please.",TeensReadToo
9780525421580,"I cannot talk too highly of this book. I will need to read it again, not only because I whipped through it at a great rate of knots, but also for the sheer of love its language, its structure, its characters and its messages. All the reviews I have read don't focus on the Will Graysons, (because there are two of them, notice the title?), but rather on Tiny Cooper. And I guess there is logic in that, since Tiny is the fulcrum between the two other boys. Also, Tiny is a truly large character, both physically and in personality. His dramas and traumas dominate the narrative. But Tiny is real, meaning things don't always go to plan. This is also true for the two narrators. Both Will Graysons are stuck in dreadful ruts. They have strict life plans and lots of defensive walls to keep people out. It's depressing in a black, funny way. John Green and David Levithan show their issues and fears as different, separate and oh so isolating. But of course ultimately it's the way they find each other, help each other and in turn help themselves. To have a realistic YA novel with not one, but two male narrators, plus Tiny, who equals two characters on his own, is unusual and very moving. This is very inspiring stuff. Hmm, I may have made this book sound 'oh so serious' and 'all about issues', that's not the case. It is so so funny. Highly recommended.",Trisha Buckley
9780061186479,"M IS FOR MAGIC is a collection of eleven short stories. This book was geared for elementary/middle school but I thought that I couldn't read many of the stories aloud in my classroom because some of the themes are pretty adult. I liked many of the stories, especially THE WITCH'S HEADSTONE. This was a story about a real boy who was living in a graveyard and being raised by ghosts. He decides to do a very kind thing for a ghost who didn't get a gravestone and the story follows the adventure that goes with that decision. I also enjoyed THE CASE OF FOUR AND TWENTY BLACKBIRDS. It was a detective story set with nursery rhyme characters. The detective needs to solve the mystery of who killed Humpty Dumpty. It is told with attitude and is very funny. There are also stories that are scary or just plain creepy. The story about the jack-in-the-box just gave me chills. So if you want to read some good, strange stories that only take about an hour to read, check this book out.",TeensReadToo
9780375865022,"This book is completely overrated. Not only is the plot-line shallow and substance-less, it fails to engage the reader and show any real character development or growth. And the characters are a whole other story. You do not sympathise with these characters, you do not relate to these characters, you do not even like these characters. The whole novel is filled with pointless subplots that do no lead back into the main plot and just seem like irrelevant words to fill blank pages. All in all, a big disappointment after the various 'raving' reviews.",Savannah Woolley

9781416990680,"Hapiness, frustration, hopelessness, forgivness, sadness, annoyance, loss, joy, despair,... Those are all the things that you encounter when reading Secong chance summer, and all of them play with your feelings in such a sophisticated way that you don't see what hit you (the fact that it made me cry in chapter two should tell you everything you need to know). Three weeks ago, on Taylor Edwards' seventeenth birth-day, the life of the Edwards family was forever changed. Her pun-loving father was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer and had three months left to live. Deciding to spend the last summer at their lake house, where five years ago, a twelve-year-old Taylor left behind destruction which she will now have to face alongside nearing an inevitable tragedy promising unimaginable heart break. It was never easy for Taylor to live with two prodigy siblings: Gelsey being an exceptional ballet dancer, inheriting their mother's talent; and Warren having a photographic memory, always proving his amazing academic skills. The only talent Taylor seems to have is running away when things get tough. ?C/??As I looked out at the water, I realized there was nowhere to go, nowhere left to run. And I just had to stay here, facing this terrible truth.?C/?? Although throughout the story we witness great character development, especially among the Edwards children, my favorite character remains their mom, who shoved nothing but strenth, courage and infinite amount of patience and love. What really got to me, though, was Taylor's relationship with her dad as she got to know him better during their summer, learning little things that make him who he is and realizing that they were very much alike. And as the only thing left to do was count down the days, Henry, Taylor's first boyfriend, and Lucy, ex-bff, kept Taylor's focus off the calendar hanging in her kitchen and I grew to care for them very much. It is a powerful story about friendship, family and love; second and last chances.",Jozica Kubot
9781416990680,"I immediately connected with Taylor's voice. I had such sympathy for what was going on with her dad, because it was made clear her sadness, and just the feeling of not knowing what to do in that sort of circumstance. I also related with her on her wanting to run away, or try to avoid a problem because that was my form of dealing when I was in high school as well. I appreciated the value placed on family in Second Chance Summer. There is enough bickering between the siblings to make it realistic, and the parents are just the right amount of annoying at the right times. But you could plainly see that everyone cares for one another. And I like how she identifies what type of family they are--not touchy feeley in the physical aspect, so she valued hugs even more than someone who gets one just to say good afternoon. But I appreciated how close they got, and how much they learned about one another, and I think that it is so sad that a lot of families have to have tragedies hit in order to really connect and lean on your family. The mystery of what exactly happened between Taylor, Henry and Lucy had me captivated. I knew that something went down, and then she was away from the summer lake house for quite some time. When she returned she is put face to face with Henry in awkward situations, and I loved the tension that was there. Yes, there was anger and hurt, but there was also caring buried in there somewhere. The scenes where her father is in pain, or they are worrying, and trying to find the balance of fulfilling his wish they have a ""normal summer"" and trying to get in time with him all tug on my heart. Ms. Matson writes emotion so vividly and I did not want to put the book down. I wanted to keep reading about what the characters are doing, feeling, and how they are growing and changing as a result of this summer, where she realizes maybe there can be a second chance for love and friendship, but on some things there just can't be any more that can be done. Henry in this book is so sweet, understanding and crushworthy. Especially when what happened summers ago is revealed. I won't say a lot about him except I really enjoyed reading his character. Another secondary character that I adored was Taylor's brother Warren. He is so nerdy and intelligent except when it comes to social matters, and it is fun watching him fumble around in that aspect as well. The ending was so sad, but I appreciated how hope was woven in. Taylor grew so much, but it was hard because of what it took and the pain that she went through in order for the change to come about. Bottom Line: All the elements of a perfect summer read with heartbreak on the side.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780062059994,"In a journey which started with 35 girls all competing for a chance to win the prince, it is now down to just four. America is still struggling with her feelings and finds the competition more fierce than ever. Against a mean girl, a sweetheart and a girl who would would be a perfect princess, America doesn't see where she fits. The fact that she keeps letting her heart rule her actions and disappointing King Clarkson doesn't help matters. The two factions of rebels are complicating things further with those to the south being vicious in their agenda and the Northern Rebels having a proposition which may change the way the entire kingdom is run. America finds herself in the middle of everything and realize the fate of much more than just who she loves is at stake. The Selection series is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me. I may not always like the characters or certain things they do but I adore the journey. What I enjoyed most about The One is that Kiera Cass hasn't forgotten about what made her series so great in the beginning. This is a love story. A story about a girl who has intense feelings for two very different men intermingled with a Prince who has no life experience in matters of the heart having to select the woman he wants to be with for life from a pool of 35. It's a little crazy. But it worked for me because, all the dystopian stuff aside, this is about personal choices and how love doesn't always make sense. America is illogically jealous at times and her decisions - bizarre. But I think Kiera Cass managed to capture just how intense the situation is and how mixing a competition with love drives you to do things you wouldn't normally. America has grown over the series. She's still a little too perfect and thinks she is the best thing since sliced bread however there is comfort in her consistency and she is starting to fight for what she wants. As she works out what she wants in life (and who!) her decisions start to make more sense to me as a reader and I grew to admire her for her choices. The action in this book tended to whiz past me and whilst it did drive the story forward, the focus of this book is mostly about the romance. And the romance is great. I loved how relationships became more intense and there are some love letters which I adored! There are hearts which break, couples formed and I was satisfied with just how everything went down at the end. The One is a great ending to what has been an entertaining series. It's full of romance and indecision (which can drive you mad at times!) and overall I'm glad I read it.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts

9780142417805,"I think I fell in love with Lennie Walker on the first page. She's grieving and confused but manages to keep a slightly sardonic tone throughout it all. Her sister - and best friend - Bailey dies without any warning and Lennie is left to try to move on without her. Her grandmother is slightly eccentric and her uncle perpetually stoned but somehow they are all trying to muddle though. When it seems like no one knows what she's feeling, Lennie finds a kindred spirit in Toby - her sister's boyfriend - and she knows it's wrong but he understands what she's feeling in a way that no one else seems to. If that wasn't confusing enough, Lennie meets Joe, musical genius Joe... If ever Lennie needed her big sister it was now... This book is beautiful. The writing and feeling that Jandy Nelson manages to infuse her words with is amazing to read. Lennie is a typical teenage girl who has somewhat extraordinary circumstances. Her mother dumped her sister and her on their grandmother's doorstep when Lennie was a year old, her uncle, Big, is in love with falling in love and had been married - and divorced - numerous times. And her gram is a garden guru who goes around and prunes other people's plants but refuses to let anyone touch her own. These are characters that I enjoyed reading about. They're vibrant and three-dimensional in their imperfection. And that's how I view Lennie too. She's heartbroken and makes mistakes. Her behaviour regarding her romantic life may be somewhat unconventional and I can see why other readers may have a problem with it but to me, Lennie's actions are what I would expect of someone who is human and hurting. Not always logical but what I admire about Lennie is that she does take responsibility for what she's done. One of my favourite things about this book was the character of Joe Fontaine. He's so enthusiastic and in the moment that it's hard not to fall a little in love with him. He wears his heart on his sleeve and his happiness is palpable - as is his heartbreak. Nelson describes his smile as if the way it makes Lennie feel like it's a physical sunbeam. It's kind of incredible. He contrasts nicely against Bailey's boyfriend, Toby - who is slightly damaged but well-meaning. Another highlight of this book for me was the little notes and poems that Lennie writes. She leaves her mark wherever she goes leaving little notes and thoughts on leaves, flyers - anything she can get her hands and a pen on. I thought it was a beautiful way for her to be able to have a conversation with her sister when talking was no longer option. The is one that Lennie writes about grief being a house that really made me feel for Lennie. Her guerrilla poetry was a great way to give Lennie's relationship with Bailey a voice without Bailey saying a word. This book is definitely one I recommend for fans of heartfelt and touching young adult literature. It's moving and beautiful with character that made me laugh and broke my heart. I loved reading it and it makes my list of top five YA books I've ever read. Five stars!",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780062003935,"Just be aware that this book is NOT written by L. J. Smith, author of the original 'Vampire Diaries' series, but rather, a ghostwriter. Not to say that they're not any good, but don't be fooled. None of the 'Stefan's Diaries' books are written by L. J. Smith. Unfortunately, she was taken off the series by the publisher, which is a bit of a shame. Having said that, the (original) series is fantastic. (note the 'based on the novels by 'L. J.

9780062003935,"Animals are showing up dead in the woods with their throats ripped out and the rest of their bodies untouched, and the residents of the little town of Mystic Falls are freaking out as they attribute the attacks to demonic activity. Through all of this mayhem, there is Stefan, who's led a relatively simple life. Until now, that is. The boy suddenly finds himself faced with an unexpected arranged marriage and an equally unexpected visitor - alluring and orphaned Katherine Pierce. Needless to say, it is attraction at first sight, and when Stefan's brother, Damon, returns from the Army and appears to be quite taken with the young Katherine as well, trouble begins to brew. Two brothers and a girl: there has to be a winner, and there has to be a loser. Based off of the hit CW television show Vampire Diaries, ORIGINS describes Stefan, Damon, and Katherine's mysterious back-story. There are countless differences between this book - co-written by the two TV show producers instead of L. J. Smith - and the original VAMPIRE DIARIES series. While both are enjoyable, I found ORIGINS to be slightly superior plot-wise, and L. J. Smith's original story to be better written and characterized. One little quirk: we never really discover who the villain is because of the abrupt ending. A nice conclusion or revelation of some sort would have cleaned the plot up nicely. Overall, the book was still appealing - the latter half especially, as the story finally picks up the pace. ORIGINS would be a great read for all die-hard fans of the VAMPIRE DIARIES series and TV show, as it presents an alternative view of the world and sheds light on the murkiness of Stefan and Damon's past.",TeensReadToo
9780062003935,"This is the first of three book series and for the record I have preordered the other two because personally I think its a good book. Firstly if you are a Damon fan you will be disappointed because there are few parts that have Damon in this book for two reasons the book is called STEFANS DIARIES and is diarised story of life through Stefans eyes as a 17 / 18 year old leading up to when he becomes a Vampire, secondly Damon is in the confederate army and for the initial part is away. The book is well written, easy to follow, easy to picture based on the TV series not the original books has all the main characters from the show mentioned. There are parts in the book that relate to flash backs from the TV series, there are surprising parts about how innocent and generous Katherine is, the turning of Stefan into a vampire is a complete difference to what he is as a human - great read",Andrew Crisp

9781907411700,"First of all, I should let you know that I haven't seen the movie version of this (yet). So there's zero comparison to the movie here. I am, however, a big fan of fairy tale retellings - the more creative, typically the better as long as the story still holds some fairy tale charm. And this is where Snow White and the Huntsman had a great feel - the premise is incredibly creative and exciting, a great way to update an old story by including more action and a stronger heroine. The problem, I found, was that it sacrificed too much of the Snow White story to really resonate and moved at a pace that was too fast to carry out the plot. Reasons to Read: 1. Plenty of story & action without romance: I really liked that the romance took a backseat in this story; there was definitely enough plot in terms of drama and action to keep the story moving along nicely without it. I didn't really feel like I was missing anything. And that was extremely refreshing. 2. Darker twist on an old fairy tale: If you've never read some of the older, more ""traditional"" versions of your favourite fairy tales, I HIGHLY recommend you do so. It's surprising how much darker they are, especially for those of us who may have grown up with the Disney versions (although I do love Disney). It definitely gives you a better idea of just how versatile these stories are and how there's so much you can do with them. And the darker tales are a bit more fun when you're older. The problem with the romance which I didn't mention above is that while there is very little (and I liked that), the little that there is ends up being incredibly awkward. There's next to no development for it and it just feels odd and out of place when it does happening. Ultimately, that was a complaint which rang true for most of the book. The story simply didn't have enough explanation for events why they happened that way - such as Snow White's awakening. There's no reasoning for it. It just happens. Lastly, besides Eric the Huntsman, there's very little development for the remaining characters, Snow White included. They felt incredibly 2D to me and didn't have distinctive voices from each other. The characters are one of the main ways an author can bring a story to life, and without any that are properly developed, you're really just left with words on a page. The unfortunate part for me was that I could really see how this story could work better as a movie - there's enough action and creepy twists in here to keep me visually pleased, even if the story is subpar. Review copy received from Hachette Canada for review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9781907411700,"I confess that I'm a little wary of reading books based on movies as it seems a little unnatural - surely movies should be based on books? Still, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about surrounding Snow White and the Huntsman. To be honest, I lack the concentration span for films, so it was actually great to see that a novel was being released - I can use my own imagination and take it at my own pace.... but now, after reading the book, I do want to go and see the film version! I have read some fantastic fairytale retellings (Cinder) and some not so great ones, so it was interesting to see what this was like. Snow White is one of the most popular fairytales that I think almost everyone knows about. It's a little dangerous to mess around with something the world knows and loves, but I think that for the most part, the changes worked out okay. The story was vivid and it felt as though there was a lot of adventure, even though it wasn't particularly fast-paced. I think that if the pace had been a bit more rapid, it would have been more effective - I think that the blurb of this book makes it sound a little more action packed than it is, but the book remained simple, perhaps so that it is more accessible for younger readers. There wasn't really anything complex about this book - it was relatively short and a quick read, so there wasn't much room for depth, but I don't feel as though the story suffered for that - I still got a good idea about all of the characters and they were firm in my mind. Personally, I like to learn more about the emotions of characters, but even without this, I did have an idea of what the characters were feeling. Of course, more development could have been made but for the type of book this is, it wasn't necessary- it's just a reasonably quick, entertaining read and it's good that way - I think that it could've gone disastrously wrong if it took itself too seriously - the easy-to-read yet still quite beautiful writing is definitely a bonus for younger readers. I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by the ending of this book - there wasn't a huge climax in the story and the ending didn't really come as much of a shock, either. There was potential to notch up the tension a bit, but it never seemed to happen. I personally thought that the ending was a little boring and a bit of an easy way out of the story, though I guess it did tie things up. Although this is a very simple and quick book to read, it was enjoyable and I am glad that I read it - just to see what the twist on this traditional fairytale was. The book does feel quite 'cinematic' at points and I feel like maybe the story could be portrayed in a slightly more exciting way on screen. However, I'm a firm believer in reading the book and seeing the film. If you like reading, for less than the price of a cinema ticket, I'd pick this up and give it a try.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

Reading If I Should Die is actually a bittersweet experience for me because this is the finale of a series I so dearly love and I?C/??m still not ready to say goodbye to the characters. I loved everything about it - the characters, the twists, the story itself, the setting, the action, the romance, the magic. I?C/??ve always admired Kate for being a strong heroine. Not physically though, but in mind and spirit. She is her own person and doesn?C/??t rely much on other people. She knows when to be strong and when to give in to her emotions. In this book, she proved herself worthy of the fate bestowed upon her. Vincent is amazing as always. Georgia is unbelievable. She?C/??s funny and smart and loves Kate so much to accept and support her sister?C/??s choices. And her flirtation with Arthur is cute. It?C/??ll be interesting to know how their ?C/??relationship?C/?? would progress. Bran, the gu???Â©ï¸risseur, is a very crucial character. The gu???Â©ï¸risseur magic is really amazing and I often found myself surprised at what it can do. The identity of the Champion did not surprise me, though. Ever since the second book, I?C/??ve always had this theory on who the Champion is, so when it?C/??s finally revealed I was actually expecting it. But the predictability ends there. Amy Plum kept me on the edge of my seat every single time. I was always curious and eager to know what happens next.

And gods, I?C/??ve never truly realized how amazingly talented Ms. Plum is until I read If I Should Die. She wrote the entire series beautifully that emotions flowed out of every page. I could feel Jules?C/?? pain; I really felt sorry for him it was heartbreaking. I could feel Kate?C/??s grief and despair when Vincent died. I could feel their hope and joy. It?C/??s like I?C/??m also one of the characters and our emotions are one. I cried, I whooped in joy, I swooned, I celebrated their triumph, I fell in love. Only a handful of authors have managed to do that to me so far and the fact that Amy Plum could connect like that to her readers is a proof of her writing genius. Of course there are also heartbreaking moments. I?C/??m not going to give spoilers but Jules, Genevieve, Jean-Baptiste. ASLKDHFJSKJ!!! Yeah, find it out for yourself, dear reader. Go ahead and read If I Should Die to know why those three revenants made me cry. Congratulations, Ms. Plum for a very well-written series. You deserve to be applauded and given a monument for the wonder that is the Revenants series. It?C/??s such an amazing experience to know the Paris revenants and come to love them.

9781907411045,"Favourite Quote: ""Feelings change with time - or at least the pain lessens with time"" This book was an incredible ending to this awesome series! Everything turned out the way I wanted it to! 5/5 stars from me! I am proud to say I guessed all the main plot points in this novel in the second book in the trilogy! But that didn't stop me from enjoying watching it all pan out! The last 100 pages were so action-packed and suspenseful, so awesome! I have to admit there was a lot of information given during the first half of this book which I found hard to remember and understand at times but overall I thought the plot was very well developed and enjoyable! As for the characters I just loved them all even more in this book! Katy was even more bad-ass then the last and I admired her strength and devotion! Vincent as usual was just perfect, love him so much! Ambrose, Charlotte and Jules are some of my favourite secondary characters ever! Though I am still upset over that one sided love triangle thing that went on with Katy, Jules and Vincent, I found it completely irrevalent! Overall this series was amazing all the way through but I think this book has been my favourite so far! Cannot wait to read more of Amy Plum's work!",brookexx
9780312532758,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Gosh, I forgot how good this book was! The first time I read it, it was back in 2009 when it first came out! I never continued to the sequel because I got caught up with other books, but I decided to re-read it so I can catch up on this series! I'm glad I did, I got sucked in just like I remember doing when I first read it. A lot of people like to compare it to Twilight, which really gets on my nerves because it is NOTHING like Twilight. I don't understand how people see it that way. I love Twilight, I really do. It's one of my favorite series, but Evermore is so much better. It has a very unique plot line, which I love. The writing sucks you in. Noel definitely knows how to write. She has that tone to her writing where you fly through pages without realizing because it just flows so nicely together and as an aspiring writer I really admire it. And the characters were unique and alive. From the outside, they seem like your stereotypical characters, but once you get to know them they have their own personalities that makes you pull away from it. I like most of the characters, except the popular crowd. They annoyed me. As per usual. But Ever was definitely a great character, though she did annoy me at times. But hey, being annoyed by her those few times really makes her that much more real. Also, I love her name! And I also love Damen, naturally. He's really weird at first, and kind of creepy, but oh so hot! And Haven and Miles, I'd love to be friends with them. They are so weird, and I love it. Though Haven definitely annoys me with her weird latch-ons to new friends like Drina. Ugh! Overall, I enjoyed re-reading this book and I can say that I will most likely re-read it in the future sometime. This book is unique and has a lot of great things in it. A psychic main character, a hot mysterious love interest, mystery, and awesome friends!",Amanda
9780312532758,"This is a re-read and review. I first read Evermore a while back. It had already been out for a while but even though I was absolutely in love with the cover, I never allowed myself to pick it up. Finally, I gave in and bought it. And I fell in love instantly. There's pretty much nothing I dislike about this series. There's a real life element to it, it's not completely thrown into a fantasy world, and I tend to lean more towards books that have a real world element to them among magic and mayhem. This book definitely delivered. I love the paranormal aspect and the fact that you can't quite figure out exactly what's going on. Throughout the book, you obviously fall in love with Ever and lust after Damen, but you can't really figure out if Damen is a good guy, or a bad guy. If he's a good guy, why does he do bad things? If he's a bad guy, what is his real motive? There are so many things that happen in the book with the story line as well as the characters that you definitely don't get until you've already read further ahead and then go back and re-read. A lot of stuff makes a heck of a lot of sense after you know what's going on. I love books like this and I felt like the characters were very well developed. My only complaint about Evermore is that the situation with Drina could have played a larger part in the novel. It seems she only becomes a big part when she and Ever have it out. You know there's something going on there because of the oddness of her actions and Haven going so crazy about her. But you never really know that she plays such a big part until the very end of the book. I wish a few more hints had been dropped or the underlying story line could have played a larger role.",Rainy Days and Pajamas
9780312532758,"Since the accident that killed her family, Ever can see auras, hear people's thoughts, and know a person's life story just by touch. She also has regular conversations with her dead sister. She didn't ask for these new talents and her efforts to hide her gifts have left her a freak at her high school. But when Damen Auguste enters the picture, everything changes. Damen is movie-star gorgeous, mysterious, and the one person who can block all the psychic energy Ever keeps trying to avoid. Damen and Ever are drawn to each other, but Ever can't shake the feeling that there is something that he's hiding. He's the only person that Ever can't read anything about. Damen has no aura, Ever can't hear his thoughts, and she has know idea who - or what - he really is. Every once in awhile, a book comes along that I end up getting sucked into and become addicted. EVERMORE was one of those books. When I wasn't reading, I was thinking about how I could sneak away to read some more. I couldn't put it down. I dreamt about this book. When I finished, I couldn't get it out of my head. This book was simply breathtaking. Ever is a wonderfully realistic character that grows throughout the novel. The guilt she feels over her family's accident and her grieving process are heart-wrenchingly real, as is her growing acceptance of her new psychic gifts. I also loved the scenes with Riley, Ever's little sister. Who knew a ghost could be so funny and charming? I know she's just waiting to have her own series written about her. And Damen...well, what can I say - I'm in love. If you're looking for a new lit-boy crush, Damen is it. Alyson Noel knows how to write for and about teens, and this is one of her best books yet. I can't wait to find out more about the mysterious Damen and step into Ever's world again. Combining mystery and romance, EVERMORE is the beginning of the next must-read paranormal series.

The cover attracted me at the book store, and even though I had never heard about the book I just had to buy it and let me tell you it was worth every single penny. Ever is definitely not your teen-next-door, she's got psychic power she'd rather not have: she can see aura's, read thoughts and.. see ghosts. In fact she sees one ghost: her little sister. Her sister is one cute little thing who adds a touch of lightness to the story. Everything gets mysterious when Damen ""to new guy"" shows up at her high school, the guy is smoky-sexy, secretive and he can silence the world for her. Most of the book their relationship is like a roller coaster, full of ups and downs and you have no idea if they will end up together or not. Most importantly we have no idea what Damen is, one thing is sure that guy isn't normal either. I really enjoyed it!

9781423108771,"I had this book on my a??To Read Lista?? for a long time. I was a little bit afraid that it would be the same as many other ghosts stories in YA books. First of all, I loved the way Alender writes. She doesna??t give away the important information, maintaining the suspense and mystery of the story. The characters are well built and the plot is consistent and interesting. Alexis is perfect for the main character of this story. I couldna??t help feeling empathy for her in some parts of the story. Kasey is her younger sister, who has a passion for dolls of all types. When Kasey starts acting weird and many strange things start happening at the same time, Alexis seems to be the only person of their family noticing it. She finds herself in a difficult situation, because she loves her sister, but Kasey is not the same person anymore (at least not every time) and her actions can seriously harm those around them, including their family and even Kasey herself. Yes, it has some high school drama, but it doesna??t distract you from the other side of the plot. In fact, this teenage-life part of the plot ita??s necessary for the whole plot to come together and make sense. The descriptions are very well made, especially the ones about Alexisa?? house. Many times I found myself picturing the characters in a house like the ones we see in horror movies, making the plot come alive in there. It didna??t make me feel excited like the feeling I have sometimes that makes me want to keep reading more and more, but ita??s an entertaining book and easy to read. After finishing reading this first book, I want to read the other books of the series. Ita??s not a book that will keep you awake at night because you are afraid of what is in the dark, but it gave me chills now and then.",Joana
9781423108771,"Bad Girls Don't Die was a great read I couldn't put down. It was well written, gripping, and you just had to know what would happen next. I'm not a person who usually reads horror, but I found this book a great book as it's not hardcore horror; it also had fluffy moments, some very deep sayings and a lot of comical moments woven in together with the creepy parts, making me forget it was supposed to be horror. ALEXIS is the main character of the story and she's mostly lovable; she is very honest in what she is, indifferent, bows to none, has pink hair and she's considered different from everyone, but not a bad different. She was also sometimes infuriating, such as when she was mean to her parents, her dad in particular, or how she just kept assuming so much about everyone, often missing a person's true personality. I felt like the author tried to make her 'cool' and 'indifferent' too hard, making her hard to relate to, at times. However, I think the fact she has those bad parts is good as it related closely to Alexis's growth in the book - and she does grow, quite a lot. She learns to appreciate her family, not to judge a book by its cover and be a nicer person in general, which was lovely to witness. One of the things that bothered me in the book was the sitcom-ish qualities to their family. It may have been funny, but it also made them look much less real. The supporting characters, ranging from Kasey, Alexis's sister; Megan, the unlikely alley; Carter, the cute guy with the dark past that Alexis kinda likes, and Alexis's parents, all added to the story and Alexis's growth, though some of them were pretty one dimensional. The ENDING to the book was perfect; people got hurt, the effects of the possession didn't magically disappear, and it took them time to recover - emotionally and physically. Not to mention how happy I was that Alexis didn't jump into a relationship and that their family united. Really, such a good ending, and a great book! Recommended for people who like ghosts, horror and those who are looking for a light horror to start their horror career with.",Nitzan Schwarz
9781423108771,"Alexis might not be perfectly well-adjusted to high school life, but she finds her niche as an outspoken pink-haired smart-aleck quite satisfying, thank you very much. Her four-person family is far from perfect, but they have always managed to get by, in their spooky architectural jumble of a house. Alexis' mother spends more time at work than at home, but so do millions of other moms across America. Kasey, her doll-obsessed little sister, is sometimes too passive for her own good, but hopefully the doll-collecting is something she will grow out of. As for her father, they aren't exactly close, but he could be worse. One night, after a family argument leaves Kasey in tears, Alexis comes to the rescue in the role of comforting big sister. Kasey requests a story, so Alexis soothes her with a made-up story off the top of her head. Since it is for her baby sister, the story revolves around a little girl and her doll, Kasey's favorite topic. Naturally, Alexis doesn't think much of the story, though come to think of it, it is a bit strange at how smoothly the spontaneous story rolls off her tongue. However, shortly after Alexis' tale, Kasey starts behaving weirdly. More strangely than normal anyhow. It starts small, with her eyes sometimes changing color from blue to green and using old-fashioned language, like ""oughtn't."" At first, Alexis tries to brush away her foreboding feelings, deeming the odd vibes she is getting from Kasey as a figment of her imagination, nothing serious. When mysterious lights appear in the middle of the night, doors close themselves, and the air conditioner goes haywire to the point where Alexis can see her breath in the house, she knows it is no overactive imagination. She has no idea what exactly is going on, but something weird is happening in their house, and much as she hates to admit it, Kasey has something to do with it. Events spiral rapidly out of control, as midnight wanderings progress to thievery and even attempted murder. Alexis has no idea who to turn to - does anyone even believe in the supernatural anymore? People might just lock Kasey up as schizophrenic, but Alexis knows better. Her little sister is not crazy. Kasey is possessed. Katie Alender's BAD GIRLS DON'T DIE is a haunting tale of one town's murderous history and a ghost that wants revenge.",TeensReadToo

9780312561284,"When sixteen-year-old Naomi Porter takes a header down the front steps of Thomas Purdue Country Day School, she loses a lot more than her pride. Although she remembers the ride in the ambulance to the hospital with James Larkin, and recalls that her blood ended up on his shirt, and even remembers that he assured the ambulance driver that he was her boyfriend, she's having a really hard time remembering anything prior to that. Anything, say, that happened in the last four years. Awake and alert in the hospital with her dad by her side, Naomi knows that something's wrong. She knows her name, and she knows where she is. What she doesn't quite understand is that the last tangible memory she has happened when she was twelve. She can tell by the way her body feels that she's not twelve any longer. And then comes the first of many shockers: her parents are divorced. Oh, and her mother is remarried to her high school sweetheart, and they have a toddler named Chloe, who happens to be her half-sister. And she has a boyfriend named Ace, who conveniently enough is away at tennis camp. And her best friend, William ""Coach"" Landsman, is also the co-editor of the school paper, The Phoenix, a position she shares. And on and on the list goes, until all Naomi wants to do is scream. In the course of a few minutes and one bump on the head, Naomi has lost four years worth of memories. She still knows she's adopted, she recalls her life up until the age of twelve, but everything between seventh grade and her current position as a junior in high school is a blank slate. For some, she's a girl to be pitied. For others, she's just another teen looking for attention. For herself, and her father, and her best friend, and her boyfriend, and the boy she begins to fall in love with, she's something else entirely -- an enigma, a girl without a past who must forge ahead to make her own future. I truly enjoyed MEMOIRS OF A TEENAGE AMNESIAC. The tone of the story is a perfectly balanced mix of humor, seriousness, and the search for identity. There are moments that are sad, and even downright heartbreaking, mixed with scenes of hilarity. Ms. Zevin, the author of one of my favorite books ever, ELSEWHERE, has penned another story that will leave you wondering and thinking long after you turn the final page.",TeensReadToo
9780375838866,"Reason for Reading: Next (and last) in the trilogy. It's the final showdown in this volume. Nimiane is making her move to take over the empire, her hatred for Henry's bloodline makes his whole family targets of her wrath, especially him, since they are tied together with the blood bond and she knows how powerful he could become. Most of the book takes place within the worlds of the cupboards, with the doors being used for travel and a few pit stops are made here and there to the house in Kansas in the process. People actually notice a few strange things happening where the house used to be and the area is becoming popular to the paranormal events -type crowd. Henry learns a lot more about who he is and who he could be while Henrietta becomes much more of a teammate than she has ever been before, though she and Henry do end up on different teams at times. I think all the characters have grown as people throughout this series and that is always a good feeling to have at the end of a series. The paranormal elements of this volume where quite intriguing. The full truth comes out about Henry's scar and his ties to Endor because of it. Henry's case is an exciting one as at one point it boils down to the options of giving up and dying quickly or going forward to die with honour or at least die trying. But things are never always as they seem and at the end we can sigh with relief at the happy ending. In fact, this is my main problem with the book, the ending is too pat. All ends were finished off just so perfectly nicely that it destroyed some of the story's believability for me. The other thing I find annoying is the trend of these juvenile fantasies, with book 1 being 200 and some pages, book two pushes the 400 mark and then book 3 has to top them all off by trying to become a 500 page tome. That is what actually made me take so long to get started on this book since I had enjoyed the first two books so much. An interesting, well-thought out fantasy world and story that delivers an exciting conclusion while on the other hand draws out the trilogy when it might have been trimmed a little to make it a bit move quicker and therefore more tense.",Nicola Mansfield
9780060887414,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) As some of you may know, I started this book right after finishing Perfect. I know I said that I thought Perfect was my favorite so far of the series, but I have found a new one. Unbelievable certainly lives up to its title. I just can't believe everything that happened in the fourth book. I'm still sitting here stunned, and all I'm going to say on that matter is 'A' is revealed in the fourth book. After learning who it was, I went through so many different emotions. Astonishment, victory of having this person on my suspect list, and then annoyance at thinking it was someone entirely different in the end before 'A' is revealed. Sara Shepard definitely knows how to throw you off the track. She gives you clues here and there to make you suspect someone, who may or may not just be the person, but then she steers it toward someone completely different and makes you believe that this person could possibly really be 'A'. But then in the end it's the other person you may have suspected. It's very clever! I know a lot of people may think that this is just a girly, fluffy series. But it's not. It's full of mystery and suspense. Even though I'm still a little weirded out by how different, but sometimes how close, the series and books are together, I still love the books and they have become a favorite series of mine. In my opinion, I think this one is the most intense of the first four Pretty Little Liar books. In the beginning of this book, I thought I knew what to expect from this one. But I was wrong. I mean, some things I thought were going to happen, happened. But I never thought that maybe 'A' would be revealed, and even though I suspected the person who is revealed as 'A', at the same time I didn't think it could of been this person. Overall, this is a great series and I can't wait to continue the series. Even though 'A' is revealed in this book, the pretty little liars aren't being let off that easily just yet. There are more lies and mystery to be revealed. After all, who really killed Ali?",Amanda

When we last left the pristine Rosewood, Hanna had just discovered who A was, but she knew too much and A made sure she couldn't say anything by ""accidentally"" hitting her with a car. Now, as Hanna fights for her life, the other three girls have to clean up the mess that A has made. Spencer finally remembers what happened the night of Ali's death and what she remembers isn't good. Could she really have killed Ali? Not only does she have to deal with the thought that she could have really killed her best friend, but she's got to reason with the guilt of stealing her sister's AP Economics paper, which got Spencer nominated for an award her sister should have won. With the feeling that A is constantly breathing down her back, will Spencer be able to keep her cool composure, or will she finally pop? After A let it leak that Emily likes girls, Emily's been living on the edge of sanity. Her parents don't know what to do with her, so they send her off to her ultra-conservative relatives in Middle of Nowhere, Iowa. When she arrives, Emily knows she won't last long -- then she meets Trista, an interesting girl who seems to understand Emily and doesn't mind talking to her. Will Emily last, or will she flee back to Rosewood and hope that she is accepted by those who love her most? Aria's been kicked out of her mother's house after her mom found out she had been keeping the fact of her father's affair a secret for the past three years. Once again, we have A to thank for unveiling this bit of information. With nowhere else to go, Aria moves in with her father and his horrifyingly peppy girlfriend, Meredith. All Aria wants is for her life to go back to normal. When she starts an art class over at the neighborhood college her partner is none other than Jenna Cavanaugh, the girl who was the terrible victim of a nasty prank that Aria was a part of. Can Aria ever escape her past or will it keep catching up with her? Then there's Hanna, who really is hanging on for dear life. She can't remember anything from the night of the accident, especially the identity of A. The rest of the group doesn't want to pressure her too much, but they really want to know who A is. If this isn't enough, Hanna has to deal with her feelings for Lucas. She remembers hanging out with him a couple of times, but that's it. It seems, though, that a lot more happened. Will Hanna be able to get her memory back and solve the mystery of who A really is? PRETTY LITTLE LIARS has always been a favorite series of mine. I mean, who can resist the scandalous secrets of others, especially of those who live in Rosewood? UNBELIEVABLE completely blew all three of the previous books out of the water. It could almost be a stand-alone book if all the information we learn in the preceding books wasn't crucial to the plot. It seems that the author finally became comfortable with the characters in this book. They felt like real people and some of their issues became more realistic. I also felt that it was much easier to relate the characters in this installment. They didn't seem as stuck up and it was easier to like them. In my opinion, this is a particularly important part of a book, because if you can't relate then it's hard to actually imagine the feelings that the characters in the story have. While I think this was a weakness in the other books, the author has completely redeemed herself with this addition to the series. The plot itself was great. Suspense has a totally different meaning to me now! At no point did I find myself knowing what would come next. I eagerly turned the pages hoping to devour more secrets and uncover more answers. The author did a great job hanging the identity of A over our heads until the final chapters of the book. And just as you thought you knew who killed Ali, wham!, the author threw another curveball at you. Before I had even started the book I had known that A would be uncovered in this book and was truly wondering how the story would continue afterwards, as there will be a total of eight books. I found that as some answers were told more questions surfaced. Again, the author left us with too many questions left unanswered. Now I simply cannot wait for the fifth book. In the meantime, I urge you to pick up UNBELIEVABLE, as it is simply impossible to put it down.",TeensReadToo

Her parents moved to Crescent City, in Northern California, about an hour away from her cabin to open a bookstore. At her high school Laurel meets David, and he invites her to join his group of friends. He also becomes her best friend. As she is getting settled into her new life, she gets a bump on her back - which grows bigger and bigger until she sprouts a pretty blue blossom. This blossom makes her look like she has wings. She manages to hide it from her family and the people at school, but she and David begin to investigate. He looks at cells of her blossom and her cheeks and comes to the conclusion that she is made of plant cells. Laurel goes back to her cabin home in search of answers. There she meets Tamani, a gorgeous young man who tells her that she is a fairy. She has been helping the fairies guard a secret that is by her cabin home. Later, her dad takes ill and Laurel and David risk their lives fighting trolls, who are trying to acquire Laurel's forest home. These trolls are scary! They are big, strong, and the main one is smart. WINGS is the first of four books, and it leaves us with Laurel living two different lives. Should she go back to her fairy life with Tamani, or stay and guard her adoptive parents and be with David, who Laurel also has feelings for? I really loved this book. It had everything: love, chases, close escapes, dramatic choices, and lots of magic. The writing was very good, and at some points I had to put down the book just because I was so nervous for the characters, which for me means that I was totally involved in the story. Laurel is someone who I would want to be my best friend. David is also fantastic. He is what I would love to meet and have in my life. He is accepting, brave, and extremely helpful. Tamani is strong, intense, and sexy! What a choice! I highly recommend this series. It is fun and very believable. Go now and buy your copy of WINGS! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780062059963,"In retrospect, it might have been a better idea to review it before reading the installemnts, but I couldn't stop reading to actually do it! It was that good. I finished the entire series in less than half a week. Despite the fact that I hadn't even wanted to read it for a long time, claiming I wasn't interested. It's main theme was romance after all, and I'm not usually into sheer romance without further ado like something paranormal. Well, I was wrong after all, very very wrong. Since the synopsis summarizes it rather thoroughly, way better than I could, I will start with the review right away. More accurately I will start with the plot right away. Honestly, I loved every moment of it. I was engaged maximally, not being able to stop because there was always something happening. It was not only about the Selection and the romance, but the dystopian world and the complications of life as well and these all together resulted an intriguing and colorful story. Secondly, the world building. I really liked the idea of being in the future where anarchy is set up again. This is something that could indeed happen to us, because why not? Who knows how long this system will pull out, if after a 4th World War we won't start changing things dramatically. And frankly, Ms Cass brought out the most of it. The rebel attacks and the layers of it add a lot to the story, the castes and jobs are brilliant and the idea of the Selection is utterly unique. The history piqued my attention, too. I felt as id I was on a real history lesson and was being taught our own past. However, the most exceeding aspect was the characterization. I loved the characterization. The characters were all individuals, some of them lovable, some of them strangable, but all of them as if they were real, breathing people. America, our protagonist, grew the closer to my heart with her stubbornness and strong temper which yet didn't prevent her from being a purely good soul, a person who loves with whole heart and wants to help where she can. I adored her way of thinking, but could have strangled her sometimes, especially when she bottled up and held back things that could have made her situation easier. Maxon, the prince, was a lot different from how I imagined. Through Americas eyes we first think he's stuck-up, just because he is what he is, but when we first meet him...Even though America doesn't even like him in the beginning, it's obvious he's not any of those bad things she thought. In fact, he's caring, loving and smart, and adorably insecure around crying women, but knows little about the real misery of the world. Later on they develop a friendly relationship nevertheless, the cutest friendship I have ever seen, however, the affection is visible from the very start. As for Apen, I didn't think much of him. He was sort of a jerk in my eyes, however, the end left me a little clueless concerning his intentions. And last but not the least, Kiera Cass's writing style is something distinct and charming. More than that, it's captivating. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it was so big-time. by Cassidie @ Rebook424",Boglarka Kenedi
9780062059963,"The Elite delivered exactly what I wanted in the second book of the Selection series. There's more drama, more love triangles and more gorgeous gowns fit for a princess-to-be. America Singer is still in the middle working out her feelings regarding her two admirers - Crown Prince Maxon and her childhood sweetheart now Palace guard, Aspen. Every time she thinks she's decided which way her heart is leading her something happens and makes her feel mixed up all over again. Maxon only has six girls left in The Selection and where America was once comfortable regarding his feelings towards the other girls she's now anxious and more jealous than she ever though she'd feel. Emotions are running strong. Marlee is still acting oddly, Celeste has more nasty tricks up her sleeve and the King weighs in with who he think Maxon should pick... The first half of this novel doesn't have much regarding the dystopian aspect of this book but the second half ramps up and delivers some much-anticipated action. The rebels are back and the threat to the crown and country. The remaining girls from the Selection get more time to show who they are as people as well as learning the importance and responsibility of being Maxon's wife. America is still a little too amazing for my liking - being a hero to the people and the funniest girl in the Selection - but more of her flaws came out as this series is developing. The love triangles are a little overwhelming at times with America deciding on one of her men and then being adamant that it's the other one she's meant to be with. And then another flip-flop in her decision a few pages later. For the Bachelor fans - there's still quite a bit in this book for you! Extravagant balls, a bit of scandal and scheming competitors are still in the mix and feel like they'd be right at home on the show. Whilst the Bachelor aspect is what drew me to this series, I've grown attached to the characters and unique drama Kiera Cass has brought to her story. I can not wait to read The One and find out who America chooses and which of the remaining contestants will be Maxon's bride - along with just how much more damage the rebels will inflict.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780061996191,"If it's possible, I loved Hallowed even more than Unearthly! Like the first, this one is a beautiful story, very tender and sweet at times. But there is also a somewhat darker feel to it as Clara struggles with the choices she has made and still has to make, and the consequences of those choices. There are more twists and turns and a lot less predictability. The characters grew over the course of the last book and I felt like they were even more explored in this one. We learn so much more about Clara's mom and she becomes a bit of a tragic figure. In Unearthly, she often irritated me, keeping secrets that I thought she needed to share with Clara. It was the same at the beginning of Hallowed, but with this book comes a great deal of understanding. However, with the answers come more questions! The love triangle is still going strong and is just as engrossing. I had fears that it, after having been drawn out through two books, would be tired and predictable, but it wasn't at all. I still can't decide if I am Team Tucker or Team Christian yet, as I flip back and forth constantly! I love that we get to know both of the guys as their own people, separate from Clara. But the best thing about this book? Clara's story throughout the book and especially at the end. Clara had a rough time throughout this book, one thing right after another. There was no easy tying up of loose ends, ""everything is better now"" ending for her. No one swooped in and solved her problems. I liked that because it is real. There was a lot of heart break in this installment, sadness that had me shedding ugly tears at times! The only thing I really didn't get was the appearance of Clara's dad. He just reappeared in her life and there was no real conflict or angst about it. I know they are angels, but it seemed a little out of touch to not have even a moment of anger or confusion or belligerence. Things to love about Hallowed... --Clara's mom and dad. Their story was sweet and romantic and more than a little tragic. --Hand's writing. The story is beautifully written, sweeping you along without weighing you down with lengthy descriptive sentences. --Clara's friends. I love Angela, the token emo girl, and Wendy, the bubbly other BFF. They are great friends and interesting characters in their own rights. My recommendation: Better than the first so READ!",Kim
9780061996191,"Source: Bought (an autographed copy!) SPOILERS for first book Unearthly as well as Hallowed OK-it took me way too long to pick up this delightful sequel! I think part of that was my general indifference to angel stories though I've seen this ranked as one of the best, I'll still take contemporary over paranormal any day. The other part would be a lack of infatuation with Tucker. It seems like almost everyone else in the blogosphere swooned for the guy but I didn't get it. I did like Christian though. I'm glad I already wasn't a fan of Tucker because his behavior in this book is not great. He's increasingly out of the picture, rather personality-less, and very jealous. As he should be because Christian and Clara are able to draw closer based on their shared angel heritage. But, I'm totally biases as an admitted member of Team Christian. Still I didn't like how Clara shunted Tucker to the side for his own protection. I hate when male paranormals do that to their human girlfriends and I hated it here too even though I don't like Tucker. Yeah, I have complicated feelings about the romantic relationships. Did I mention there were spoilers? Because more are to come, starting now... So Clara's dad is an angel? This makes sense. I actually knew that because I read some reviews with spoilers beforehand. I didn't predict that (as I mentioned in my Unearthly review, I bought that he was in New York doing whatever) but it didn't surprise me. Clara just seemed to powerful to have so little angelbood. I'm also ""glad"" that Clara's mom died. Not because I like reading about moms dying (way too common in books, TV, and movies) but because I wondered about her weakness in the first book and it was explained here. I'm still wondering about Jeffrey-since we only get Clara's point of view, he does not come off well and I found myself very pissed off at him and his behavior. I'm also wondering about the overall battle between the angels and the Black Wings. I don't feel like all that much happened in this book even though I'm sure it is all pushing toward a grand finale in the third book. I'm especially curious to find out more about Clara's purpose (and how Christian ties into it). It is probably too much to hope that they'll procreate and bring more angel babies into the world but I can dream. Overall: A really fun sequel although maybe a bit on the long side when considering what happens and what the audience learns. Excited for Boundless Cover: I liked the purple on Unearthly more but it's good. They look nice on the shelf together.",Stephanie Fleischer
9780060887353,"The cover: I like it. It's not bad neither good. However, I do love the font *_*. And if you didn't know, this is Hanna Marin on the over. What's cool, is that on the back cover you can see the real model for Hanna, it's done in all the books. The storyline: Where should I begin? Let me get directly to the point after the summary. Summary: Flawless picks up right where Pretty Little Liars left off. In this sequel, we get to know more about The Jenna Thing, Toby and each girl's secret. Aria is no longer seeing Ezra, and somehow she gets caught up with Sean, Hanna's ex-boyfriend. And her family's situation is only getting worse. Spencer's attitude has completely changed. She's now dating Wren, her sister's ex, and she thinks everything is still fine. Until, her deepest secret is going to be out. And then things crumple down. Emily is really messed up. She can't make up her mind about her feelings. She becomes friends with Toby, and finds herself really liking him. Thinking by doing that she's proving to herself that she's not gay. Well, guess faith had other plans for her. Finally, Hanna is dealing with her own demons. Not that this isn't enough, her father comes back to add fuel to the already strong flames. Everything seems to be working against her. And guess who's ruining and manipulating them? Of course you'd guess, it's ""A"". The girls meet and actually talk to each other, in the last chapters, in Foxy, a charity party, where they seem to not be able to find Emily and they think she's in serious danger. the book ends with them finally acting like friends and thinking that they've got everything figured out and there's no more ""A"" until shim (a.k.a Him/She) sends a very threatening SMS to Emily. And that's the end. What I Liked/Loved: - The storyline. It was amazing. - The suspense and twists were unexpected. - The way the chapters were laid and how each chapter had a very interesting title. It's like I had to decipher the title and make possibilities of what might happen. - The ending :). What I disliked: - Sometimes I would find the story fast paced and other times it'd be really slow. - The characters were just not reliable. I know there are teenagers like them, but it was just too much. The characters: Aria: She's a very charismatic character. Although sometimes she becomes really obsessed with fixing everything and becomes whiny. Despite all of this, she's strong, protective and very friendly. Sometimes I find her a bit naive even. Spencer: The perfect student and child has gone wild. Since kissing Wren, Spence became more careless about everything. She tricked her parents and Melissa (thought she tricked her...). But her biggest secret yet, is about to be revealed and crash everything around her. Emily: She's in my opinion the most honest and the nicest character in this book (if not the series, but I can't tell from two books.). She struggles with her true self and with everything going on in her life. Between her swimming, her feelings for Maya that she keeps burying deep within her and her new friendship with Toby, she has no time to deal with her secrets coming out. Hanna: She the funniest, the most active character by far. She shops, gossips, keeps secrets and tries to get Sean back. Until her father comes back and brings a bunch of ""gifts"" for her, one of which turns out to be as deadly as ever. Toby: I seriously have no idea what to say about him. In the books, he is friendly, nice and keeps trying to make out for the bad decisions he made earlier in his life. Until he ends up, well, you'll know when you read the book. Other characters worth mentioning are: Sean, Hanna's ex-boyfriend and Aria's current boyfriend. Jenna, Toby's stepsister who is blind thanks to Ali. Andrew, Spencer's date to Foxy. He's the first of the class and the class president. Wren, Melissa's boyfriend until Spencer made up with him and now he's her boyfriend. Melissa, Spencer's older perfect sister. Maya, the new girl living in Ali's house now. She's Emily's new friend and possible love interest. Ben, Emily's ex-boyfriend and fellow swim team member who keeps teasing her about being a lesbian and doesn't stop. Favorite quotes: Emily gritted her teeth. ""Yeah, but Toby is much, much nicer."" She also wanted to add, And don't worry, he's white, but she didn't have the nerve. --- Chapter 18: SURROUND YOURSELF WITH NORMAL, AND MAYBE YOU'LL BE NORMAL TOO. P.S. You hurt me, so I'm going to hurt you. Or maybe I should hurt a certain new boyfriend instead? You guys better watch out-I'll show up when you least expect it. - A --- Chapter 20: LAISSEZ-FAIRE MEANS ""HANDS OFF,"" BTW ONE NEW TEXT MESSAGE, her little Nokia said. Emily felt her heart speed up. Poor, confused Emily. I bet you could use a big warm girl hug right now, huh? Don't get too comfortable. It's not over until I say it is. -A --- Chapter 37: STRING BRACELETS ARE SO OUT, ANYWAY. Conclusion: To be honest, I wish I've read the books before watching the show. Throughout the book I've been either spoiled or bored because I kind of knew what was going to happen. Also, I read it in a very stressful and confusing time, so I didn't enjoy it really and kept going back and reading each page because the next day I couldn't remember what I read the day before. So yeah, this is why the book was ruined for me. The point? This book is really good. And I'm sure if I read it, like in nine months, I will probably give it 4 or 5 stars. One more advice: Don't read spoiling reviews or blurbs before you read the book, they might ruin the experience and the suspense element. What's next? Perfect of course!! I want more of ""A""!!! :D.",Randa Kerbache
9780060887353,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Oh. My. God! I can't believe I went through this book so fast! I mean, back in the old days when I really had nothing better to do (Ah, sometimes I miss those days where I could sit around and read all day and night! *sigh*) I would of finished this in about 2 hours or less, but now I can't do that. I have to split up times. But this went by surprisingly fast! I love the TV show, and you know, the TV show does go by the books surprisingly well. I love reading through the book and reading the details of it--even though I saw it on TV--and going ""Omg, I remember that!"". But you know, like all book to movie/show adaptions there are some parts that are majorly different. Like something that happened in this book that certainly has not happened in the show and I really hope it doesn't or I'm going to cry! I'm not going to tell what, though! The details are awesome and so is the writing. Sara Shepard is awesome. End of story! The book is in different points-of-view, if you've watched the TV show, you know which four girls it is. =P If not, then Aria, Spencer, Hanna and Emily. Most of the time I absolutely hate switching points-of-view, but in Pretty Little Liars I don't. I LOVE it! I'll finish a chapter super fast and then can't wait to get back to a certain someone's chapter, depending on what happened in her chapter. If that makes sense at all! It's hard to describe this series, I mean, it's light and fluffy but at the same time it's sooo mysterious! I'm always trying to figure out who A is. It drives me nuts! But I know once I do figure it out, I'm going to hate it and be really sad. Do any of y'all think that we know who A is, and maybe have it in the back of your brain somewhere, but just really can't spit it out? That's how I am. Especially with the last message A left for the next novel. Ahh!! Overall, I'm really loving this series. Book AND TV show. If you are a huge fan of the TV show, fill in the times between episodes by reading the books! Holds back your lust a little bit. Just a little bit, ha-ha.",Amanda

9780007465224,"(Source: I own a copy of this book.) 16-year-old Kira lives in a world where humans are dying out. After the emergence of a deadly disease called RM 11 years ago, 99% of the human population was wiped out, and the last known human colony lives on long island. RM continues to be deadly though, and not a single human baby has survived for more than 3 days in the last 11 years, and people are getting desperate. The Hope Act states that all females over the age of 18 must get pregnant, and must continue to bear as many babies as possible, all in the hope that a baby will be born with immunity, but it hasn't happened yet, and Kira isn't sure it ever will. Kira is training in a medical field, she's been working in maternity, and has already watched too many babies die. When her best friend Madison reveals that's she's pregnant, Kira knows that she can't let that baby die too, and knows that she has a time limit to find a cure for RM. Partials (half human-half robot sentient beings) were created as soldiers to battle in wars, but they got a bit sick of this, and a war came about between the partials and humans. Everyone believes that the Partials created RM as a way to wipe out the human race, but that isn't what Kira is concerned with, she's just interested in the fact that Partials are immune to RM. Explaining her theories to the chief of the hospital and the head of the government gets Kira nowhere though, and so she devises a treasonous plan with her friends - to find a partial, and study him, in the hopes of developing a cure and saving Madison's baby. Can Kira really develop a cure for RM? Can she save Madison's baby? And is there more to RM and the partials that the humans don't know about? This was a really good dystopian novel with a bit of a sci-fi twist, I just wish the pacing had been a little quicker. I liked the storyline in this book, I thought that the world-building was done really well, and I was really excited to see what Kira could discover about the partials! There was excitement and anticipation in this book, but I did feel the pacing was a little slow. At 468 pages this book seemed to take forever to read, and even though I enjoyed it, it did seem to drag a bit. I liked Kira, and I liked how devoted she was to curing RM. It was interesting that nobody else had even considered studying the partials after 11 years of dead babies, and when Kira eventually did get her hands on a partial, I did find it a little difficult to swallow that she was put in charge of research regarding him, even though she was only 16 and a very junior staff member at the hospital. Personally I would have expected at least a couple of people from the research team to be pulled in too, but I understand that the whole venture was being kept quiet. I liked the interaction of Kira and her friends, and how they each helped in their own way. I really felt for Kira when she realised that her best friend's baby would die, and how personally she was invested in discovering a cure for RM. There wasn't really a romance angle in this book, although Kira did have a boyfriend and there were discussions about marriage and babies, this wasn't really a storyline, and Kira was actually quite displaced from the idea of having children herself when it was suggested that the legal age for pregnancy as part of the Hope Act would be lowered. I really can't imagine how dreadful it would be to live in Kira's world, and how awful it would be for so many babies to die! I did like the positive hopeful ending that we got though, even though things weren't really resolved. I liked the storyline that we got from the Partials though, and how similar a situation they were facing. I would have liked to have learned more about the Partials, as I thought the idea was a really good one, and I'm hoping that there will be more information about them in the next instalment! There was also a revelation towards the end of the book that I hadn't seen coming, which I hope will also be built upon in the next book. Overall; A great YA dystopian, if a little slow-paced. 8 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780007465224,"This was certainly different. Once I read the synopsis I have to say the idea really appealed to me. This line certainly captured my attention ""Humanity is all but extinguished after a war with partials-engineered organic beings identical to humans-has decimated the world's population.""-quote from Partials synopsis. Although the plot wasn't fast paced it was certainly well rounded and it did hold my attention throughout the book. There was only one point my mind wandered. I really like books that make you stop and think, there are certain things in this book which with the way technology is advancing would be plausible in the distant future. Quite scary stuff really. I really liked the ending too, such a cliff hanger. This does mean that I cannot wait for the next book to be released, which if I remember rightly is in the early part of 2013. The only reason that this book lost a star rating and didn't make it to five was that it wasn't fast paced enough for me. About two thirds of the book was at a plodding pace and then whoosh off it went. I do like my books to be compelling page turners, that is the only criticism I can think of. So on the whole not bad then. There were plenty twists to the plot, some of them I did guess and others left me with my jaw gaping. There was a good mix of 'good and bad' characters, some of them you really got to know, others only just scratched the surface. I'm pleased to say that there were two joint favourite characters Kyla the main protagonist and Samm the Partial. Kyla is certainly someone to be admired, she has a great fighting spirit and truly believes in doing what she believes is the right this. Both characters were rich in depth and I could really see how they were an essential part of the story. I really want to find out even more about them in the next book. Exciting stuff! Would I recommend this book? Yes I would! It was a totally unique story and one that certainly captured my imagination. Story Rating: 4/5 - If you are a lover of post-apocalyptic dystopian stories, this is a must read. Cover Rating: 4/5 - A very chilling cover and certainly very apt to the story. *** Many thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for supplying me a copy of this book for review.***",Jennifer Juckes
9780316123518,"My review: This has been my favorite thus far in the series. There are so many twists and turns and I was always trying to guess what was going to happen next. It was action-packed and the secret quotient was definitely raised. The weaving themes of love and sacrifice, both romantic and not, was beautiful and it makes the reader look just a little differently at them. The characters were as strong as they have ever been, as real as possible when created within the pages of a book. I was swept right along with them through their highs and their lows. I actually did my fair share of crying, ugly crying, at points! Things to love about Beautiful Creatures... --The mood. This is most definitely NOT a ""feel good"" book! But I liked that because it was raw and heart wrenching and real. The feelings that it evoked were intense and engrossing. --The ending. Not that I wanted the book to end, but the cliffhanger was good! Things I wanted more of... --The supporting characters. So much of this centered on Ethan, which was great, but I have grown to enjoy a lot of the less central characters. My recommendation: Love, love, LOVE so definitely pick this up!",Kim

9780152162801,"It is at some unspecified time of the ancient Roman Empire, and Mucius, Rufus, Caius, Antonius, Flavius, Julius, and Publius are all students in the school of Xanthos, whom the boys nicknamed Xantippus because he reminded them of Socrates's bad-tempered wife Xantippe. Caius had disturbed Rufus and wouldn't let him study, so Rufus angrily writes ""Caius is a dumbbell"" on his wax tablet which he hangs on the wall. When Xantippus sees it, he sends Rufus home and threatens to expel him. When the boys arrive at school the next morning, they find that someone has broken into the schoolroom, attacked Xantippus, and stolen several articles, including Rufus's tablet. But then an even worse crime is committed. They find that someone has written ""Caius is a dumbbell"" on the temple of Minerva dedicated to the Emperor by Caius's father Senator Vinicius. Unfortunately, the handwriting expert Scribonius confirms that it is in Rufus's handwriting, so while Rufus steadfastly denies that he wrote it, he is taken off to prison and is slated to be sold as a galley slave. The boys must look for clues to find the real culprit and save Rufus. Who might have been responsible for it? Could it be Senator Vinicius, or Lukos the astrologist whose house is across the street from Xantippus's school, or even the Emperor who is jealous over the military victories of General Praetonius who just happens to be Rurus's father? Or is there someone else lurking about? And will they be able to solve the case in time to spare Rufus? I first heard about Detectives in Togas back in 2007 when it was recommended by Love to Learn, a homeschool resource company. This delightful story not only presents readers with a suspenseful yet good, clean mystery but also gives youngsters a lot of insight into daily life in ancient Rome, with a good dose of humor along the way and a surprise ending. During excavations at Pompeii, a temple wall was found on which the words ""Casius Asinus Est"" were written. These literally mean ""Caius is an ass,"" i.e., a stupid person, and this fascinating bit of history forms the basis for Winterfeld's imaginary plot. Author Henry Winterfeld (1901-1990) was born in Germany, wrote his first children's book Trouble at Timpetill in 1933, and emigrated to the U.S. in 1940. He originally wrote Detectives in Togas in German as Caius ist ein Dummkopf, and it was translated into English by Clara and Richard Winston. Being set in ancient Rome, it contains numerous references to the Roman gods, including such exclamations as ""by all the good gods,"" and to drinking wine. However, it corroborates the fact that the Emperor insisted on being worshipped as a god, which was the basis for the persecution of Christians in those days. There is also a moral to the story, as Xantippus uses the fate of the criminal to remind the boys that ""The path of vice leads inevitably to ruin."" A sequel is entitled Mystery of the Roman Ransom.",Wayne S. Walker

9780738713700,"I love Maggie's writing. I honestly don't know how to describe it. It's magic. It's awesome. It just pulls you in and doesn't let you go. That's why I stayed up until 2 am on two occasions reading LAMENT. That's not something I usually do. But, I love Maggie's writing so much and she just wouldn't let me go to sleep. She would whisper at me from the pages: ""But don't you want to find out what's going on? Don't you want to find out what Luke is? Don't you want to see what's going to happen??"" and I'd say ""OK fine, Maggie, but it better be good"" and it always was. Deirdre is a talented musician with a dysfunctional family. Her mother manages her life, her father barely seems to have any impact on it (I didn't realize until halfway through that she had a father), her Granna acts weird and spews stuff about faeries and wearing iron, and her aunt is way too full of herself. James, her best friend, keeps her grounded and makes sure she has fun. He's the light in her world until she meets Luke, who holds her hair back while she pukes before a performance (her pre-performance ritual so to speak). The story unfolds as Luke and Deirdre become friends and she starts seeing faeries. She eventually learns that they are very dangerous creatures and are trying to take her away from house and home. Then a whole bunch of crazy stuff happens and we learn about what They (the faeries) want from Deirdre, what is up with Luke and who he is, and more! But you'll have to read it to find out what ;). I really liked Deirdre and Luke as characters. Never while I was reading did I get frustrated or irritated or bored with them. They were both consistent and real throughout the book. I love how they were able to bond over music, with Deirdre playing the harp and Luke playing the flute. I have give kudos to Maggie for being so unique with her instrument choices for her characters (especially a male playing the flute!). It may have seemed sudden, but Luke and Deirdre practically had an instantaneous trust in one another. For a character like Deirdre who is shy and has few friends, seeing her make a connection with Luke was nice. Their relationship was complicated because Deirdre wasn't sure what Luke was at first and, even when she found out things about him that should have sent her running, she still felt she could trust him. By the end, I was just rooting for them and their relationship, hoping that it would work out and everything would be ok. I honestly don't know what else to say about LAMENT. I mean, there's TONS to say, but at the same time, I'm having a hard time pulling together words. I want to tell you about all these awesome parts so that you'll want to pick it up, but I don't know how to do that without spoilers. So... here: there's fog and a graveyard; there's a physical connection between Luke and Deirdre, although not in the typical, sexual way; there's a bitchy aunt who I hate; there's helpful, mysterious, funny, and scary fey; there's action, there's pain, there's sadness; and there's a bittersweet ending. If you want to see how all of this comes together or just want to read a dark faerie book with a subdued, but steamy romance, then definitely pick up LAMENT and give Maggie's debut a try!",Pamela Green

Luke's amazing musical skill unlocks something deep within Deirdre. Her talent at the harp becomes unmeasurable; however, other things begin to happen as well - strange things. Dee discovers that she possesses the power of telekinesis. She also learns to read the thoughts of those around her. Dee knows that Luke is somehow a part of all the craziness that is taking place, but he is unable to reveal his secrets. Those secrets have the potential of killing both Luke and Dee. Dee must unravel the mystery surrounding Luke before it's too late - for both of them. Stiefvater has created a novel that is reminiscent of Melissa Marr's WICKED LOVELY. The story centers on a girl who captures the attention of Faerie creatures. Of course, it is the responsibility of the human girl to set the wrong things right once again. The author's formula veers from the norm by incorporating music into the plot. Dee plays the harp; Luke is a flautist; James, Dee's best friend, plays the bag pipes; all the while snippets of old Irish songs adorn the pages before each section of the novel. The world of Faerie is becoming more prominent in young adult fiction, and this will be a welcome addition. Look for its sequel, aptly named BALLAD, due out next year.",TeensReadToo

9780141353258,"In a social experiment with a difference, teenager Maya van Wagenen decides to take the advice from a self-help book for teens to become popular written 60 years ago, apply it to the modern world, and write about her experiences. For the entirety of the eight grade Maya documents her feelings and the reactions of people whilst asking the question ???????????????C/?? is it possible to go from social outcast and the bottom of the popularity ladder to being the top of the social scale by following advice from a bygone era? I wasn???????????????C/??t expecting to enjoy this book nearly as much as I did. Maya writes so honestly about her life, her family and the reactions of people in her small town as she embarks on her crazy adventure. I liked how Maya decided to tackle this project ???????????????C/?? breaking the popularity guide by former teen model Betty Cornell down into manageable parts ???????????????C/?? starting with the most achievable and slowly building up to the more challenging sections. She wrestles with girdles, replaces eye make-up with vaseline and puts herself firmly out of her comfort zone on her journey to do whatever Betty says. The journey is gradual and believable. Maya doesn???????????????C/??t just wake up one day, become 1950???????????????C/????????????????2s version of a queen bee. Rather, she painstakingly follows Betty???????????????C/??s advice no matter how humiliating or hard. She???????????????C/??s dignified in her approach to her project no matter what obstacles are in her path. Maya writes with humour and intelligence well beyond her years. Her story is well-written and relatable for readers of all ages. I loved reading about her journey following Betty???????????????C/??s advice but what sets this book apart is how honest and candid Maya is about her family. Her closeness to her parents and siblings is a beautiful thing. The family photos and anecdotes were just as important to the story as Maya???????????????C/??s journey to popularity. It is clear to see why Time Magazine named Maya as one of the most influential teens of 2013. Her decision to transform herself into a woman best suited to the 1950???????????????C/????????????????2s may seem ridiculous but Maya achieved what she set out to do. She had a goal to do something out of her comfort zone no matter what others thought of her and, with the support of her family, ???????????????C/?? she managed to see it though to the end. She???????????????C/??s brave and took the risk of following Betty???????????????C/??s advice and changed her outlook on life in the process. Popular may not be the kind of book I read a lot of but I???????????????C/??m glad I decided to give Maya???????????????C/??s book a go. It???????????????C/??s funny and inspiring, entertaining and intelligent. There are things from Maya???????????????C/??s story I think everyone can learn from and I definitely look forward to seeing what she writes in the future.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9781442409064,"I had heard a lot of good reviews about this book, it seemed to be one that had a well-built dystopian world and well developed character. And as I, and apparently most female teenage/ Young adult readers, have now become obsessed with dystopian novels I had to read it. But once again it feels like this book has something missing. I have noticed with a lot of dystopian and fantasy novels nowadays that either the world or the characters are sacrificed to get a story written quickly. With this book I felt like the world was a bit sacrificed. I liked the characters, although they were nothing special and I have now forgotten their names (Note to self: Take notes when reading for review purposes) but I really did not like the world they were set in. It seemed very flimsy. Ok so in order to make sure that the human race was immune to everything we managed to create a race of super humans that have children with an abnormally short lifespan? That makes sense. Not. But what makes even less sense is in this dystopian world future is the fact that womens life expectancies are shorter than mens, when it is currently the other way round. I mean ok I understand that our main protagonist is a teenage girl who doesnt understand much about genetics but that feels like a bit of an excuse as to why there just isnt an explanation for things. This world was obviously built around the characters to give the author a way of telling the story she wanted to write, and I have no problem with that, except for the fact that it is blindingly obvious. The world is just badly created. I mean, as if the entire world decided that in one generation they would all have their babies made into the super babies and as if the entirety of the world EXCEPT for the United States ONCE AGAIN GETS DESTROYED. Im getting a little tired of everywhere but America being wiped off the map. What about Europe, Russia or China, who are all equally capable of fighting back and surviving? If you ignore the fact that the world is ill conceived and concentrate on the characters this story is almost enjoyable, hence the 3 stars, but I got it for cheap on my kindle and would not recommend it to anyone who was going to pay full price. It is just such an easily skippable book.",Iona
9781442409064,I thought this book was very well written. I love the story line and the characters. I think there is a very small variety of emotion from the main character. Her journey and her story in the book is amazing. The idea of what the world has turned into is very cool to think about as you read. Also I became very close to all the characters in the book so I would recommend this book to anyone.,Mary Worley
9781442409064,"We are directly thrown into the story of Rhine, who is captured with two other young women, Jenna and Cecily, to please a rich doctor's son, always locked away in a gigantic house surrounded by an even larger garden. There are only a few different characters, nonetheless their possible reactions to each other are always unpredictable. Rhine felt like a very authentic character to me, really easy to get acquainted with. She is not only exceptional in looks, but also differs emotionally from her kidnapped co-brides. I like her name, Rhine, originating from the European river, lets always associations pop up in my head, because I cross this river almost every day, quiet funny. DeStefano has a talent to portray exceptional characters full of contrasts. Rhine and her fellow bride sisters couldn't be more different. Jenna is special for her compassion and loyalty, Cecily for her childish and naive personality.But beside these innocent young girls, there are also cruel and malicious characters that cause great conflicts. Wither offers many different types of love stories, although the major romance might develop between Rhine and Gabriel. Still that doesn't keep me from analysing other relationships between our given characters and questioning their morals. We get to know our characters very well, relationships are featured, but a general love story comes off badly. I realize that under the given circumstances a grand and romantic love story between Rhine and Gabriel is not really possible or inappropriate and so I hope for deeper insights in their thoughts and feelings in Wither's sequel. All characters are always circling around one setting and the other characters. Over almost the whole novel not much happens and I rather see Wither as a character study, like an initial experiment that has potential to lead to larger events and purposes in its sequel. Probably the action is hold back so that the main focus lies on the characters and the dystopian world. The setting and even actions are limited, the pace is rather slow. Sometimes we get glimpses of Rhine's life back in freedom, how she lived with her twin brother (who has become one of my favourite characters without even meeting him), but that is not enough to still my desire to explore Wither's world. Wither is set in a dystopian world, futuristic... and sick. All its new inventions and beautiful illusions cannot hide the fact that humanity's situation is a sad one. Men only got a life expectation of 25 years, women 20 years. That idea is thrilling, adds urgency to the character's actions and is scary at the same time. I always wondered how the story is supposed to develop with such a limited time span to develop actions, as our protagonist is 16-years-old, she has got four years left till she dies a painful death. Furthermore thinking of all the possibilities for our human race and that I would already be dead in such a world made me really sad. Although DeStefano didn't make me turning page after page restlessly, she had me emotionally involved. Wither's world is a super interesting construct that leaves many possibilities for future events. There is science and medical research involved, really interesting disciplines. No hard violence, sex or drugs are discussed, still this novel felt like a heavy read, because it deals with the social morals of our present society in comparison with Wither's society. Polygamy, kidnapping and stealing from the dead are regular topics. A great part of Wither is about constructing its new futuristic world by establishing several moral and ethical discourses. THE VERDICT I give it 3,5/5 stars. Lauren DeStefano builds a flamboyant world, whose little inventions and conveniences kept me entertained all the time. Wither is a debut with a promising world and striking main character that leaves room for hope for a more action-packed and romance-centred sequel.",MissPageTurner
9781442409064,"I was looking forward to reading this book however I was a bit disappointed. The beginning and ending of the book is very good but the middle I found was a little dull, about 3/4 of the way into the book, I lost interest and had it sitting on my bookshelf unfinished for a couple of days. However I willed myself to finally finish it and the ending was interesting enough that I might read ""Fever"", book 2 of the series. I like the main character Rhine most of the times however at times I found her a little dull and wished that the author had written some chapters from the perspective of another character in the book. It would have been interesting to have some insight into Linden's mind. Overall it was an okay read :)",Atqiya
9780007398638,"I have finally joined in the modern Rippermania - took me long enough! The Jack the Ripper story Maureen Johnson created is one of a kind. It's not directly a retelling of the most famous murdering phantom of our history, but a new kind of paranormal, mysterious, yet romantic, boarding-school story with a ghostly chill and thrilling modern day crime case. Maureen really did consider most of my favourite YA elements, man she's good! The story begins with a murder comitted in frank sight of a CCTV camera, with the murderer remaining absent on the screen, invisible, like a ghost. And ghosts are definitely a major part of this very unconventional ghost story. I really liked the way Maureen Johnson rolled up the new Ripper's story and how he came to commit all those murders, his methods and his motifs. Maureen drew a pretty realistic picture of what such a thing as a new Ripper would mean to a city like London. Of course THE NAME OF THE STAR wouldn't be as intriguing and gripping as it is, if Maureen Johnson hadn't processed the original Jack the Ripper cases and embedded them into Aurora's story in small and scary portions. I actually had to look up the crime scene picture of the Mary Kelly murder and a shudder went down my spine. I'm glad that Maureen wasn't too reluctant on holding back the gory details for the modern day murders in London. THE NAME OF THE STAR resembles a brilliant combination of wise chosen YA elements. The boarding school setting means a new start and an adventurous year abroad for Rory. Boarding schools are a symbol of romantic escapades, cat fights and the beginning of new friendships. So Wexford as Rory's new home for the next months was a perfect choice to set up the story. It's located in London and with that makes it the center of public attention during the ongoing murder series. The crime and mystery factor of THE NAME OF THE STAR are pretty high set, although I wasn't as scared as I hoped to be. The 1st person point of view by Rory is supplemented by a few scenes from a 3rd person perspective on a witness or victim getting in contact with the new Ripper. They add to the overall touch of the murderer's creepy everpresence in the entire city of London. The secondary characters are to some extend just as peculiar and amiable as Rory. We even get some romantic sparks. Can you believe it? A boarding school romance in London, hooray! I have to admit though, that I hoped for Rory to run off with a different guy out of her circle of new friends. Something about Stephen made me instantly feel drawn to him and I'm convinced Rory should feel that pull, too! The secret organization of ghost hunters he's a part of visibly enrichens the whole story. I always imagined Rory to be like Maureen herself. Slightly eccentric, smart and jumping in front of a killer to safe her friends before even thinking about it for a second. She was exactly the right character choice for the story of the name of the star and I'm looking forward to new revelations about ghosts, her abilities, the organization behind the ghost hunter Team of Boo, Stephen and Callum and more crime cases. 5/5 ***** THE NAME OF THE STAR - Supremely satisfying and delightfully spooky! This book gives you the creeps, but not in a bad way. Maureen Johnson invented some kind of pleasant creeps, that make you want to read on and on for the entire night, regardless the gory details and machinations of a crazy murderer mastermind. I could read a whole shelf full of these kind of books.",MissPageTurner
9780007398638,"(Source: Purchased used from Amazon.co.uk.) 17-year-old Rory (Aurora), is heading from New Orleans to London for her final year at school, after her parents took teaching placements at Bristol university in the UK. Starting at her new school 'Wexford', Rory encounters the usual problems of fitting in in a new school/new country, but what she doesn't expect is the sudden appearance of a serial killer in London, whose murders seem to mimic those of Jack the Ripper. With the murders seemingly unsolvable, and getting closer and closer to Wexford where Rory is studying, she's caught up in the mess when she becomes a witness, and possibly the only person to have seen the man they think is the copycat. Why are the police so baffled though? Why is Rory the only one to have seen the killer? And what does the name of the star have to do with it? This book was a mixture of murder mystery, and paranormal teen fiction, and it was fun trying to guess what would happen next! Rory was a great main character, and I loved her *****. I loved how she brought her southern charm to England, and I loved how she wasn't afraid to have sausages and doughnuts for breakfast! I loved that the little paranormal quirk that she picked up happened whilst she was in London, and wasn't something that she had always had, and I loved how strange everything was! I totally got her shock when she discovered what had happened to her and what she could now do! I liked the other characters in this book, especially the ones who turned out not to be exactly who Rory thought they were! Boo was a bit of a strange character, and she certainly kept me guessing, and Alistair turned out to be quite special too! I liked the storyline in this book, and I liked how it blended several different genres - contemporary, paranormal, and ghost story. I thought the three were blended together pretty well, and I was certainly kept guessing as to who was who and what the hell was going on! I also liked the little surprise at the end, which I'm guessing will lead into book 2. I also thought the author did a good job of making the setting feel English, which I gather was in part due to her spending some time over here! Overall; an interesting mix of paranormal and murder mystery. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780007398638,"The Name of the Star, an unusual name for a mysterious book. When I learned that this book was surrounded by Jack the Ripper and its myths. I thought it will be the usual, 'paranormal guy' who happens to be Jack the Ripper and he gets with 'normal girl' and they fall in love. Someone comes between them and they fight for their love and win. But no, this is nothing like that. Protagonist Aurora, moves to the UK when her parents accept teaching jobs at a university in Bristol, while she moves to Wexford, a train ride away, to finish her senior year of Highschool. Little did she know that she arrives in the UK just after a murder has spiked up the media, and was labeled the ""Return of Jack the Ripper"". The events happen and Aurora (or Rory) is caught in between as she becomes the prime witness in one of the murders as she saw the suspect no one else could. My low expectations were crushed as I read this go on about how someone is repeating every murder Jack the Ripper has committed. I loved the mystery and feeling like a detective trying to analyse the evidence and predict where Jack will strike next. But this isn't your normal YA mystery. It has its own twist which I saw coming in some sense, but didn't know for sure, until they had to admit to it all. The book was thrilling though a little gory near the end of the book. As Aurora gets in tune with her unknown abilities, she was questioned by the police then again by another, who seemed rather shady. Everything falls into pieces as you enter the middle of the book, I especially loved how the book mentioned actual events and people. All this made me think. What if it happens again? What if Jack the Ripper returns? An unputdownable mystery filled with suspense and thrill that will sure to run chills down your spine.

All her worries about fitting in and having to play hockey are soon overshadowed by a real threat though. Horrific murders are being committed in London. Murders that copy those committed by Jack the Ripper more than a century ago. Murders that bring panic and excitement, Rippermania, to London and which the police are at a loss to solve since the perpetrator manages to remain invisible from the many security cameras in the city. After one such murder Rory sees a man who may well be new Ripper, but her friend Jazza, who is with her at the time doesn't see anybody at all. After taking her statement the police appear to lose interest in Rory and what she saw, but she does find herself with a new and rather strange roommate and before long Rory discovers some disturbing facts about herself, about the world around her and finds herself up to her neck in a potentially very dangerous murder investigation. This book was a very pleasant surprise. I knew absolutely nothing about Maureen Johnson before reading this book, although my daughter had been telling me she wanted to read books by this author for ages. It turns out that Johnson is an inspired story-teller. This book is imaginative, original and fascinating. While it deals with a lot of teenage issues you'll find in most young adult fiction, it seamlessly includes supernatural elements as well as a bone chilling mystery. I found myself compulsively turning the pages, rooting for Rory and her friends while also laughing at loud on several occasions. I am delighted that this is the first Shades of London book, although it is a bit frustrating that, since I read this book before its publishing date, it looks like I'll have a long wait before I'll be able to read the next one.

While she is talking to them she suddenly feels a tremendous pain and pressure in her head. Ellies' grandpa keels over with blood spurting out of his ears and mouth. Alex sees birds falling from the sky and the deer acting strange. Alex and Ellie have to get out of the woods to find help. They decide to head to the rangers station further up the mountain. Along the way they stumble on some teenagers eating a person, they are freaked and quickly run away. They meet up with Tom when he saves them from a zapped teenager that tries to eat them. Tom is Army and tells Alex he reckons it was an electromagnetic pulse or something like that and isn't just happening here. Ilsa Bick draws you into a world that is bleak and what people are left will do anything for survival. The first time Alex sees the Zapped kids is one of the gruesomest, goriest, scariest, heart pounding, nail biting parts. The author isn't afraid to describe exactly what was happening. She pulls you into the scene and you are on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens. Alex is such a likeable character. Despite what is happening with her she tries everything to keep Ellie safe even with Ellie being a typical 8 year old and making nothing easy. She is a very scared little girl and Alex does all she can to make sure Ellie is OK. Then they meet up with Tom and he makes the girls feel protected and safe. He is so good and kind with Ellie and helps Alex learn to defend herself. He is a really strong character. In this Post Apocalyptic time Alex, Ellie and Tom have to deal with Zapped kids, raiders, savage dogs and trying to survive. Ashes read like a typical post apocalyptic book and then bam the author throws something else into the mix. Something happens half way through and Alexs journey isn't the same. From then on its twists and turns and you honestly don't know what will happen. Ashes is a action packed, scary, heart stopping story and Im really look forward to seeing what happens to these characters and Im glad I can dive into book two because with the ending of book one I was like NOOOOO!!",natalie cleary
9780857382627,"If there's a thing that post-apocalyptic novels have taught me is that I don't want to be around people when it happens. Beside the fact that some of them might turn into zombies and chew your face off, there are those who remain ""normal"", and wouldn't have any qualms shooting you over a pound of flour. Cormac McCarthy would agree. I think he'd also approve of Ilsa J. Bick's vision of the apocalypse, and even more important, the idea that it's not (just) the zombies you should fear. Ashes throws one punch after the other and is filled with action, gore and romance. Alex has not only a bunch of human-munching zombies to fight off. When the disaster strikes, she is on a hiking trip with a mission, and despite the fact that she's well-prepared, she loses all her equipment and has to survive with what little she has left. Alex is a great character, capable, brave and smart, but half-broken and confused by what's happening around her and inside her head. If you're queasy, you might find the descriptions too graphic and detailed. There's also a scene of brutal animal torture that shocked me more than the humans being chewed on. The quasi-society that we're introduced to closer to the end poses some important questions about how far people are willing to go to ensure survival in a world that's gone to bust. While we're rooting for Alex to take matters into her own hands, it's also impossible not to start seeing things from another perspective and embrace some things as necessities, no matter how morally dubious they may seem. (This was very vague, but I'm trying to avoid spoilers here.) Alex is torn between two options as well. While I wasn't completely happy about the love triangle, being able to follow Alex's line of thought made it bearable and added to the suspension. The book pretty much ends with a blast. It's completely unpredictable and I can't wait to get my hands on Shadows. Ashes left me with lots of unanswered questions, not just relating to the cliffhanger ending, but throughout he story as well. While I expect them to be answered in the sequel, those questions distracted me from getting completely lost in Ashes and that's the only reason why I'm not giving it five stars.",Ivana

Deciding that enough is enough, Alex has taken her parents ashes, cut school, and driven to Michigan, intending to do some hiking on the Waucamaw, and to scatter her parents ashes on lake Superior. She's had enough of the treatments, and she's decided to just make the most of the time she has left. An electromagnetic pulse changes everything though. People drop dead, other people become wild and start attacking people and eating them, and nothing electronic will work.

Together the three must try to survive in the wilderness, and eventually try to find their way back to civilisation. What chance do the three on them stand though, with not only cannibals out there but mercenary's trying to rob them. Wow! This book was just awesome! There was mystery, suspense, horror, and even a touch of romance. At times I was angry, shocked, disgusted, screaming at my kindle, and loving every minute of it! I loved Alex who always tried to make the best of her limited resources, and took time to care for a lost little girl, even when it meant rising her own life. I loved Tom and Ellie and the storyline was just explosive. So many ups and downs, and just when things are looking up, something else awful happens!

9781439192641,"""My name is Gin, and I kill people."" Gin Blanco is an assassin called the Spider and Spider's Revenge is the fifth book in the Elemental Assassin series. This is a world where some people have magic that controls and manipulates the elements like Fire, Stone, Ice and Air. If you have not read any of these books before then that is very sloppy, sloppy, sloppy of you because they are brilliant. I would strongly advise that you do read them, and read them in order. They are Spiders Bite, Web Of Lies, Venom, Tangled Threads and Spider's revenge. There will be spoilers ahead of the previous four books so here is your chance to look away now. Genevieve Snow was a thirteen year old girl the day that the Fire Elemental Mab Monroe broke into her home and burnt and murdered her mother and older sister in front of her. Mab then tortured Genevieve in order to get her hands her baby sister Bria. But Genevieve had hidden her sister under the stairs and didn't give up the location, not even when Mab taped Genevieve's hands together and melted her spider rune, the rune for patience, between her palms and into her skin. In all her fury little Genevieve called on her Stone Elemental power and collapsed her house about her including the stairs where her baby sister Bria was hiding. It is now seventeen years later and Genevieve Snow is no more she is now Gin Blanco. She was taken off the streets all those years ago by Fletcher Lane and trained to become an assassin not just any old assassin but the best assassin in the world, the Spider. Gin is now retired, apart from the pro bono hits she does occasionally, she runs a BBQ restaurant called the Pork Pit and has a lover Owen Greyson. Fletcher has been murdered, her baby sister Bria is a cop and is back in her life not dead as Gin had thought for seventeen years and Gin is fully intent on getting Mab to become dead. She has been patient, like a spider, and waited years for this moment, but with bounty hunters in town and prices on both her and her sister's head the time has come to kill Mab. That is going to be a very difficult job though as Mab is the strongest Fire Elemental in 500 years and Gin doesn't think she can match Mab with her Stone and Ice Elemental magic. But Gin has to do this or die trying because she wants to protect those around her that she loves, Owen Greyson and his sister Eva, her foster brother Finnegan Lane, the dwarf sisters Jo-Jo and Sophia Deveraux, the vampire Rosalyn and her lover the giant Xavier. So Gin plots to finally take down her nemesis Mab to finally take her Spider's Revenge. I love this series and this book did not disappoint. We have waited four books for the showdown between Gin and Mab and it was spectacular. We also find out a secret about the goth dwarf Sophia in this book and how she got her broken raspy voice. Although all of the regular characters are there this book tends to focus solely on Gin, it explores her feelings and thoughts and I felt a real connection with her. We also see how she changes from Gin into the cold hearted Spider. I love all of the characters in this series there isn't one where I wish I could change them they are written perfectly. There is a lot of action in the book as one would expect as it is about an assassin, and whilst Gin has a lover Owen there isn't any romance and no big sex scenes. So if you like romance and sex maybe this book isn't for you. The big ending could have been the end of the series, and I was wondering what now for Gin? But we find out in the last few pages what Gin will be up to in the next book By A Thread and I cannot wait. I truly love Gin Blanco and this series and if you like kick ass heroines who are good with Silverstone knives I would not hesitate in recommending it. I would like to award Ms Estep and Ms Blanco 5 stars. Originally posted at www.clairesbookcorner.blogspot.com",Claire Smith

I will stop there with everything because I don't want to give away many details of the book. It is non-stop action as always. Right away in the beginning we are thrown into Gin's attempt on Mab and everything rolls from there. All Estep's characters have evolved and I am curious to see what direction the next installment will take. I really enjoyed getting to know Sophia more.

If you haven't read this series yet, you should.",Kelsey Opsahl
9781416971740,"Leviathan is a captivating and intriguing alternate history WW1 steampunk book. From the first few pages, I was hooked. It drew me in like a moth to a flame. I finished it in a couple of days. I am now already on the second book in the trilogy: Behemoth (which, so far, is also very good). I absolutely LOVED this book. I would recommend it to anyone. I give Leviathan by Scott Westerfeld 5 out of 5 stars.",TheBookWorm123
9781416971740,"LEVIATHAN is a novel of alternate history. More specifically, it can be classified as steampunk, which depending on what definition you read, is an extension of science fiction and fantasy. Westerfeld decides to reinvent the era of World War I in his latest novel. While he maintains some of the actual events of the war, he creates and alters many. The story follows the lives of Deryn and Alek. Deryn is a young woman desperate to join the Air Men of the Darwinists Army (British Empire/France). With the help of her brother, she disguises herself as a boy and joins the fight. She has excellent Air Sense, which is a must for the Darwinists, since their main type of weaponry are flying airships made of living animals, with each animal in the ecosystem playing its part. The Leviathan is an airship made up of a countless number of animals - from the smallest microscopic animal to a giant whale that contains everything. Alek's parents, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, have been assassinated, leaving Alek on the run for his life. The Austro-Hungarian Empire/Germany wants him dead in order to ensure the end of the bloodline to the throne. Alek's people are referred to as the Clankers because of the loud noises that come from their form of weaponry - swords, cannons, aeroplanes, and, most exciting, walkers. Picture a huge tank with legs instead of treads. Both Deryn and Alek are dedicated to their causes, and when they are thrust into the same fight and forced to work together, both must take a look at the world around them and see things from the other's perspective. The ending really leaves the reader hanging, and not necessarily in a good way. I felt like it cut off right when we needed some important information, but I guess Westerfeld is leaving that for the sequel. The book contains several beautiful black-and-white illustrations by Keith Thompson. I really enjoyed coming across those throughout the story. Even though LEVIATHAN took me a while to get through, I still enjoyed it and look forward to the sequel.",TeensReadToo
9781907411007,"I wish Jeane Smith were real so I could be friends with her. Don't you? She's a very unique and alternative character. She doesn't care what other people think about her, has always a big mouth and a ton of hip things to surround herself with. And she's a character I guess not everyone can easily identify with as a heroine but I really enjoyed her being different than the mass of plain always the same YA main characters. Jeane in fact is a very interesting character to follow on her metamorphosis and trip to self-discovery. Jeane has many talents. She's a blogger and is an inspiration for her readers every day, like a guru. She seems to have it all, admirers and success. Jeane appears more like an adult than the teen she theoretically is. But there is more to this colorful and confident person that's her. She's living alone in her apartment, her family checking on her from time to time and at some point she realises something's missing in her life. In order to provide us with a sparking romance Sarra Manning couldn't have put anyone but Michael Lee at Jeane's side. There needed to be someone who couldn't be more different than Jeane. And that would be Michael. When they first meet you immediately notice what's not lacking...tension. It starts as a kind of kissy resentment, but soon seems to be more for both of them. Now they have to start figuring out their feelings for each other, always hiding never admitting in front of others, sometimes not even to themselves what's real and pretend.They bicker, they fight and gladly make up. Jeane and Michael are polar opposites with him being the ambitious and super popular overachiever and her being bossy and so so snarky. Their love is freakishly cute and sexy. The story being told from their alternating perspectives gives us a chance to fall in love with Michael Lee only so much more. Both are on Twitter and having conversations without knowing who they are really talking to, adding an additional entertainment factor to the story. Note that ADORKABLE discusses cheating and features sexual content. ADORKABLE has a collection of remarkable and colorful characters to brighten your day. Many components are adding up to a dynamic and multifarious story. ADORKABLE felt just right, with pleasant page count and exactly the perfect mixture of everything to make a dream of a summer read. 5/5 ***** ADORKABLE - A bright and very prominent read with so much crazy, sexy fun! ADORKABLE is the first novel by Sarra Manning that I read and I can't wait to read her other books. I'm sure just like ADORKABLE they are ultimately entertaining. Blogging, fashion, family, her love life. There's nothing Jeane couldn't master... or turn upside dow.",MissPageTurner
9781907411007,"I'm pretty sure we all know the quote, ""We read to know we are not alone,"" by C.S. Lewis. That sums up what this book means to me. This book is the closest that has ever come to being a reflection of me and my life up to now. It is so relatable, and when I find books like that, I start crying. Needless to say, this book is an all-time favorite for me - one of the most special books I have ever read. However, not everyone will have that reaction to this book. So I'm going to try to point out the merits aside from how this is such a great reflection of me, and then I'll get to the validation-of-my-life-story parts after that. Adorkable is adorable. HA. I thought I might as well get that out of the way first of all. If you're a blogger, you will have an instant connection to Jeane, because I feel like all of us are to a certain extent outsiders in our real life worlds. But at the same time, through blogging and through Twitter and such, we've found like minded people who are spread far and wide but who definitely mean something. If you've felt that discrepancy between online life and real life, between your online personality and your real life personality, between how people see you in real life and how they see you online - you need to read Adorkable, because it hits the nail on the head. Both main characters I absolutely loved. Jeane, I already mentioned, the blogger, is eccentric and at times horribly stuck up and conceited. But at the same time, you can feel that there's much more to her than that. When she's defensive and closed off, you know there's something else to the story. I related to that part a lot, and I'll get to that later. But Jeane does send a great message about owning who you are and not apologizing for that, about finding your own voice and making it loud and clear, and about standing for something and being independent. Michael, the popular boy who ""hates"" her, is just a winner. He comes off as quite abrasive at first, in his ignorance, but he really quickly grows from that. He's just a truly caring, golden boy. His devotion and attentiveness to others really made me swoon. To be honest though, I swooned from his first mention. Adorkable is told from the alternating perspectives of Jeane and Michael. Usually I don't like alternating perspectives at all, but this is probably my favorite book that's done that so far. The two personalities are extremely distinctive, and due to their circumstances (the love-hate thing) you need that look into their inner thoughts. It's hilarious when they're oblivious to each other's feelings and intentions. They also contradict themselves in their narrations every once in a while, which becomes clear when it switches perspectives again. It's a very unique writing style that is absolutely absorbing. You really get to know two fleshed out characters very well and see development on both sides, as they learn from each other. Authors, if you want to do alternating perspectives, read this book. This is how you make it convincing. So I know you're wondering about that romance. This may be my favorite written romance ever. I'm thinking now if I have a bookish (canon) couple that tops it, and I'm not sure I do. You'll probably know I'm a huge fan of love-hate relationships, and this one hit all the right notes. The chemistry was astounding. There will be involuntary flailing and squealing - you have been warned. Sarra uses all the right tropes, like the kiss-you-to-shut-you-up thing, and seriously, that's one device that will definitely make me like your book. Then the transitions in and development of the relationship, the ups and downs, it was all very real, absorbing, and addictive. AND HOT. VERY HOT. I just loved every minute of it, and I don't know how to make that more clear. But let's wrap this up so it's not entirely a novel of a review. How Jeane is as a person is extremely close to how I am - except that I'm a little less abrasive (I hope) and I don't dress quite as crazily. I've felt like an outsider all of my life, I've been shunned and looked down on by my mother, of course I am also a blogger, and I'm extremely defensive. I don't really let people close to me too easily for fear of getting hurt. I keep myself busy so that I don't have to think about complicated feelings. I avoid confrontation like it's the end of the world. So I understood a lot of Jeane's behavior that other readers might not. Honestly though, the kicker was this scene towards the end of the book, where Jeane ends up alone on Christmas day. If I wasn't in the car, reading this, with a colleague next to me, I would have been bawling. If I had been at home reading this, I would have just laid down on the floor and curled up into a ball. (Yeah, I do that sometimes, no judging.) Why? I've had that exact experience. I know exactly how that feels. And that all just came rushing back. I'm honestly almost in tears as I'm typing this. Experiences like that suck and hopefully most people don't know how that feels. You may not relate to it as well as I did, but know that that scene and the underlying emotions were right on the mark. Summing Up... I didn't know anything about this book when I picked it up. I had never heard of it, but it was at Boekenfestijn, a Dutch book fair, for, I think, 2 euros. I quickly read the back and instantly knew this was for me. As such it was the first of the 9 books I bought at Boekenfestijn that I read. I expected it to be enjoyable and that I would have a few laughs, but I never expected it to be a book that would be so dear to my heart. It's by far the best spent 2 euros of my life. I loved everything about this book. I have an everything-I-wanted shelf on Goodreads, and this definitely has a spot on there. From the two awesome main characters, their depth, growth, witty banter, and awesome romance, to the great British humor and pop culture references, to the themes of finding your own voice and celebrating your uniqueness, to the relatable scenes that had me crying, to the perfect ending... I honestly don't have a single complaint. I mean, look at this massive review, and I still feel like I'm not doing this book justice. (I barely even talked about the plot, EEP.) asdfjkl; If it were up to me, everyone in the world would be required to read this. Anyone who wants to have an understanding of who I am as a person needs to read this book. It covers all the pain and insecurities I had in high school and college, and it aptly had me tearing up at those parts. However, it's also an inspiration to me. An inspiration in that I need to just be me and feel confident and reassured in that. It's also a reaffirmation of the love in this blogging community, and it has motivated me to keep blogging and expanding my life here. I'm going to own the fact that I'm a blogger, and I'm never going to be ashamed of that or hide that from others. To top it all off, it's given me a lot more ideas and goals that I want to accomplish as a blogger - so look forward to that! Recommended To... Anyone who relates to the aforementioned feelings, all bloggers, and basically everyone. ...Yeah.",Unknown
9781907411007,"As soon as I heard that there was going to be a book called Adorkable, I jumped at the chance to read it! I mean really - a title that includes the word 'dork' just has to be good, doesn't it? The premise sounded pretty cool too - the story is about a self-proclaimed dork called Jeane and her ever-changing relationship with the 'cool' guy at school, Michael. I've not read anything else by Sarra Manning, so I wasn't sure what to expect but this one looked like a fun read. Every review I've read for this book so far have been raving 4 or 5 stars and I do feel bad that I've not managed to rate this one higher, but I think I must've missed something. I'm all for dorkiness and I'd definitely call myself a nerd. Like Jeane, I am not afraid to speak my mind or opinion (something that's gotten me into trouble a couple of times) and I'm not afraid to express myself in the way I want, whether it's through my clothing, music or art. I am also, as you may be able to tell, pretty much addicted to blogging and twitter. So yes, you could say I'm a lot like Jeane Smith, however, I still just couldn't connect with her. At points, I just felt that she was trying so hard to be different or 'out-there' that it started to annoy me and I felt as though she was a little bit hypocritical at times. Jeane often began criticising other people for what they wore, watched or listened to, even though that may have just been what they liked which I found to be a bit unnecessary - she might like being 'different', but she didn't need to force her opinions on others. At times, I felt she was slightly inconsiderate and making a big deal over nothing. Jeane was also meant to be an international online celebrity which had potential to be really great, but due to her slight arrogance, I couldn't get away with it. I don't know though - maybe I do see a bit of myself in her and I don't like it. I did enjoy reading about the more personal, quiet side to Jeane though, and that seemed to come out more when she interacted with Michael Lee, the boy who seemed to have it all - looks, popularity and good grades. I didn't dislike Michael until he started to become ashamed of being seen with Jeane which just seemed ridiculous. I did find it interesting to see how his opinions changed and it was good to see them both exploring different aspects of how the other one lived. The more 'hidden' and quiet side of Jeane was probably the most intriguing part of the book for me - I mush preferred the second half of the book as we got to learn more about the real feelings of the characters and it seemed a lot more eventful. I think that the reason I didn't enjoy this book as much as I could have was because it just didn't ring true to me. I may be living in my own little bubble, but at least where I am, I'd like to think you're not completely excluded because of the way you dress - I actually like to think the diversity in dress is something that's becoming more popular. It's true that Jeane also wasn't very popular due to her attitude, but it didn't really seem that way. I did like the use of fun, teenage language and phrases. There were a lot of popular culture references, and that was enjoyable, but I think the book could age easily. The writing itself was fine - I can't complain about that. With my inability to really love the characters and my quite high expectations, this book didn't really satisfy me as much as it could have. I think that a lot of people will love the outspoken Jeane and the trials and tribulations of her friendship with Michael. I am certainly not put off the author from this book - I have given this book 3 stars and I think that's actually pretty good. It certainly wasn't painful to read and the writing was new, fresh. Unfortunately, I just couldn't bring myself to really care for the characters, which was disappointing.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9780763642686,"Reason for Reading: This is a Cybils '10 nominee and required reading for me as a graphic novels panelist. A stunning, scholarly reinterpretation of Homer's Odyssey. Hinds has used as background material his favourite translations, then putting them aside used more prosaic translations to help him reinterpret Homer into the graphic novel format where text needs to be more sparse to meet with illustration in telling the story. I have read many, many retellings of Homer in story format. I love the epic tale of Odysseus though I have no interest in reading translations of the original verse. I'm not a fan of poetry but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the glory of the epic tale being told. Hinds has done a sensational job of retelling in everyday, understandable prose and using his striking watercolour paintings to present a flawless edition of Homer's Odyssey. As far as my memory can serve me every single plot point has been included in Hind's version, nothing has been cut to keep to a certain number of pages and in fact we are presented with an oversized, heavy book of significant pages. Hinds tells his tale basically through conversation and illustration. The book starts with a tiny bit of poetic narrative and then moves straight on to conversation, the only time narrative is used is through Odysseus' own voice as he recounts brief parts of his journey through this method. Illustration is used to great lengths to also tell the story so that the text is not left to carry the plot. There are plenty of wordless sections as the illustrations alone move the tale along. The illustrations are also used specifically to show the sensuous and the violent elements of the epic tale, going places that have no need for words. The art is stunning; the text is readable high quality prose. This edition makes Homer accessible to anyone, of all ages, 13 and older, while remaining a scholarly presentation. A must addition to any Homer or Greek mythology enthusiast's collection.",Nicola Mansfield
9780763642686,"Many of us are familiar with Homer's timeless cl***ic. Odysseus, hero of the Trojan War, is desperately trying to return home. The gods have not looked upon him favorably, and he has incurred the wrath of Poseidon. His adventures are housed in this new graphic novel edition. He relates the tales of the Cyclops, the Sirens, and the deadly Scylla, who decimate his ship and crew. His journey is long, tireless, and wrought with sadness. Because of his persistence and loyalty to the gods, he is rewarded in the end. Gareth Hinds has retold and illustrated many cl***ic tales, including BEOWULF, KING LEAR, and THE MERCHANT OF VENICE. His artwork is nothing short of amazing. He has provided stunning watercolors to enhance the retelling of this epic poem. He has also made the poem much more accessible to teen readers. Hinds has taken great pains to stay true to the original tale, including quotes that come directly from the text. This edition would be an excellent way of supplementing a unit about THE ODYSSEY. Teen readers who are curious about Greek mythology and literature should definitely give this graphic novel a chance.

9780007346141,"I really did enjoy this book. However I am only giving it 3 stars because I got a little confused in the first half of the book, mainly because I haven't read the series in a while and therefore forgot past events.

9781419710476,"After Splintered that was one of my favourite debuts from last year when I found out that Anita was planning to write a sequel, I was very excited and very intrigued about how was she planning to continue the story! I preordered Unhinged quite ahead of time and for once, The Book Depository shipped it quite in advance, so much that it arrived well ahead of release date (Jan 7th), it could have been a Xmas present even, because it arrived on Dec 26th! As usual I will be trying to keep the review spoiler free, cause I wouldn't want to spoil any of the shocks for you! But be warned since there will be spoilers for Splintered. Unhinged was what any good sequel should be about. Full of twists, shocking revelations, unexpected information and constant surprises. The stakes are getting higher with every turn of the page. Alyssa chose to leave Wonderland behind and return to her normal life with Jeb and her parents, to try and save her mother from the curse of the Liddells. But Red is still on the loose and Morpheus is not giving up one his claim on her. Unhinged focuses in Alyssa's fight with who she is. Her human half and her netherling half. She doesn't realize her strenght and seems to be scared of accepting who she is. She keeps on fighter Wonderland and herself and despite understandably not trusting Morpheus, she keeps on venting her frustrations on him. Wonderland keeps on creeping into Alyssa's ""normal"" life cause quite a lot of trouble for her. And she keeps on finding out that most of what she thought she knew isn't right, and she has to face loads of revelations about Morpheous, Wonderland, her mum and her parents. Sometimes I must say I wanted to shake Alyssa when she kept asking Morpheus for help and then treating him like vermin. I agree that he deserves quite a smack here and there and eye rolling more often than not, but you can't just automatically blame him for everything! But you cannot fault Alyssa for not trying her best to protect those she love from harm, even at the cost of her own sanity or appearance of it. Alison, Alyssa's mum was quite a surprise. I had no idea of her side of the story and I'm so glad that we get to know about it and she and Alyssa finally have an honest talk! The lack of trust and truth is one of the main obstacles here in Wonderland, too many secrets leave Alyssa and the other vulnerable to Red and other enemies. Anita Howard's writing is immensely visual, she brings to life every scene in my head in a way very few books can, and her Wonderland has what I call a Burtonian Wonderland quality: vivid, extra creepy and full of madness! And if you add to it a creepy clown toy, wood that can eat you and a zombie prom... Sometimes I fear to think what else she can concoct! For all of you, yes, there is a love triangle, Alyssa is getting torn between her two natures and Jeb and Morpheus, but for once I was not feeling aggravated about it! I don't find Morpheus so irritating at all, but so far, I remain Team Jeb. The ending... well that ending was freaking cruel and heartbreaking with a proper evil cliffhanger. But Anita redeemed herself with the final pages of Alyssa taking charge of her future, embracing herself as she is, human & netherling! I just cannot wait to read the next book NOW!! More than well deserved 5 stars!",Pilar Albarran
9781419710476,"This is a review for the second book in a series and as a result may contain spoilers for the previous book. Let me first say this, there was not nearly enough Wonderland in this book. Just putting it out there that the next book needs to include more Wonderland (I actually understand where Howard is taking the series and that the 3 books will be set in 3 different worlds but I still love Wonderland so much that I miss it). Unhinged takes place a whole year after the events of Splintered and Alyssa is in her final year of High School, about to graduate. As the novel starts Alyssa is firmly in a relationship with Jeb, who does not remember the time he spent in Wonderland and doesn't know about that part of Alyssa's life. She's thinking about loosing her virginity to Jeb on prom night & worrying about other teenage things, but Alyssa is not a normal teenager and soon finds out that 'normal' is a luxury she can't afford. The novel progresses as Morpheus warns Alyssa that Red is seeking to take back Wonderland and kill her, and that if Alyssa doesn't come into Wonderland to stop Red then the fight will be brought to her world. Alyssa wants to save Wonderland but is scared of the person she could be in it and more importantly she chose to go back to her world and be with Jeb, so she thinks it shouldn't be her problem any more. On the other hand, Morpheus is determined to make her the Queen he thinks she was born to be. Morpheus decides to become part of Alyssa's world in order to provoke her into action and enrols in her school as a student. Hijincks and other things ensue and Alyssa is dragged back into the Wonderland conflict. Unhinged was equal parts about the love triangle and the power struggles going on in Alyssa's life. This sequel completely did a complete 180 on me and changed everything I thought from the first book. In the first book I was 100% team Jeb and all for Alyssa staying in her world, however the way Howard wrote Unhinged had me questioning all that until I was team Morpheus/ Wonderland. The first part that changed my mind was they way Jeb was acting. In the book he's so desperate to prove that he's not a bad guy like his dad that he's often neglecting Alyssa to do it. Don't get me wrong he's all for the big gestures, like painting his blood on white roses, but he's so desperate to kick start his Art career that he ends up leaving Alyssa alone after she almost drowns and is rushed to hospital. It just didn't make sense to me and left me hurting for Alyssa every time she felt insecure or abandoned. On the other hand Morpheus is there for her, in his usual way of not being fully honest with her, but still standing by her side and lining things up so that she can be the victor. In Unhinged you definitely get to see a more vulnerable side to Morpheus and you realise he's not going away. More than that we find out that every moment of Alyssa's life has been influenced by Wonderland. She can't escaped it now she is Queen, and it has always been a constant in her life, even before Morpheus would play with her as a child. It seems inevitable that she will end up there. Also, Howard really throws a spanner in the works by showing us a possible version of the future. How can Alyssa pick one life when she knows eventually all roads lead to Rome, assuming they all survive long enough for her to decide? Overall, Howard has written an amazing sequel to an amazing first novel. The characters have only gotten stronger and the way Howard describes the hauntingly bizarre Wonderland creatures is just amazing. The ending though was heart wrenching, I can't see a future for either of her potential loves after what they're about to go through, especially not Jeb who's already broke enough. I just need the third book right now damn it! If you haven't checked out this series yet then what are you waiting for?",Iona
9781907410765,"**spoiler alert** I have just the book yet after reading the first page, I was really disappointed. Not only was I expecting some delicate introduction about angels and their history, I was left with an unsuspenseful start to the novel. I didn't really get anything about this book. It screwed with my mind and it became harder to read. It became a task to read this book. It was that bad that I actually HAD to convince myself, no FORCE myself to read this as I got it for free. Let's just say that the writing let down the whole story. It was filled with Bethany babbling about life on earth blah blah blah. Even when she wasn't with Xavier, he was all she talked about. Xavier this, Xavier that. For crying out loud, you're a freakin' angel! How the hell can't you save your own skin? Seriously, every YA book tells us the same thing. We need boys to save us because we can't probably do that because we're so damn weak! The only likable character that possessed some depth was probably Ivy. She was nice and understanding. I was left to believe that she was real. As for the others, they were flat. Wait... I forgot, their mission was to save Earth from it's ""dark forces"". Hmm. Dark Forces. You wouldn't find out those ""dark forces"" until page 340 something. Most of the book blabbed about her relationship with Xavier and how Beth needed to be protected. Why? Are angels that fragile? Like, seriously, she has wings. She can just fly! As someone had said before, this book DOES have the so called ""Twilight Syndrome."" Yes, it does because I found some seriously similar scenes. I can't think on the top of my head but believe me, there are some. Okay, moving on. The way Adornetto writes is just ridiculous. She makes Beth sound like a dumbass which in her case she probably is. The writer uses too many similes, many of that don't even provide description to anything. It was just all over the place. I finished this last night so I can't really remember much. Jake Thorn? Ironic. He's a demon and his surname's thorn. OOh, interesting. Okay. He really wasn't. He reminded me of a screwed up Edward. As if Gabriel, wasn't enough to fuel the whole syndrome, there's Xavier who is a half mix of Edward and Jacob. So, his main point of making Beth his lover was because he spent centuries searching for the right ""one"". Demons have feelings? Wait, was he even a demon? No, he was an ""agent"" of darkness. An agent? She just twisted the whole idea of religion. She even made God sound rude and cruel. Back to Jake Thorn, he really wasn't interesting. Sure, he can't write fancy poems, he's hot and that totally fuels everyone's hormones. But really, why Beth? She's so average and even she pinpoints that nothing is interesting about her. Damn right she was. She was just flat. She was so flat you can run her over with a car. That's how flat she was. She kept complaining how she was just new to this mission and fight for good and evil yet no matter, how hard she tried to be good, she messed up big time. One, wanted to impress her siblings that she adopted a dog. Two, she even rarely visited the lady who she adopted it from and the next thing you know, she's dead. Well, no, she guided her way to die. More to her character, she kept whining how she was being a rebel but she ""wanted"" Xavier. Um, reality check, you were here to do your mission not be with some guy. Like, would it really hurt to be more guarded? Oh, and there's the whole sex thing. I know there are consequences with the whole sex thing but seriously, another one of those Bella moments borrowed off from Twilight. For my sake, have sex already! It's not like the world's gonna end. Well, maybe for Beth. She could be a fallen angel and she wouldn't be let into heaven. OOOH. Another scary plot. No, damn it! You should be more focused on your work, you useless angel! Okay, another thing, how the hell can her siblings allow her to see some guy. They weren't even doing good to the environment. Sure, they were spreading ""love"" but seriously, that was internal. The environment could be killing themselves and all they'll do is, ""Oh no, this is all my fault, Xavier."" ""No, Beth. It's not your fault. I'm here."" ""Oh, Xavier, I love you."" Kiss, Kiss. Like how cliched was that? ""Bethany you have the most powerful gift of all."" I was anticipating something then Ivy said, ""love."" LOL. That was cheesy to the max. Going back on the whole love thing. Um, Xavier, Emily died and you're still brooding over it? Harsh for me to say but reality check, she's dead, live your life. Oh yeah. How the heck is seeing someone so beautiful lead you to caring about them? How? Geez, and the whole prom thing (was this even set in Australia?) As a guy, you should know better. You could have still come to the prom. Use your crutches or whatever, even have a normal party. The girl said she wanted to be with you. Like, you guys are declaring your 'love' for one another yet you don't understand a thing. Oh, and after Jake's blackmail, you were pretty angry about that. Yeah, there's no trust in your relationship. Oh, I remember some Twilight similarities, the whole after Beth got ""dumped"" by Xavier was sort of the New Moon thing for Bella. Ridiculous! I had to restrain myself from throwing this book as I got it for free and didn't want to damage the beautiful cover. The book was just that. Beautiful cover. ****** writing. -- After having read her first few novels, I was extremely proud that such a young author can produce such a good book. Having recently discovered of her new work, I was excited. (This was also because of the fantastic cover and the title but let's not dwell on that.) Though Adornetto might have an imaginative mind, her writing is so strikingly average and even a novice such as I, can write something like that. Again, it is disappointing that she changed her perspective and writing to suit the genre. Her knowledge for words proved no match for the awkwardness that was delivered by some of the scenes. Some of the descriptions were pretty basic and I expected a whole lot more from her. I thought that she would have made an improvement in her writing, but clearly, I was wrong. Nevertheless, I think she has a good grasp of the whole story but her poor execution through her writing hindered it. An unpleasant start to someone who I thought possessed great talent.",Kim
9780545224901,"3.5 stars I had heard many good things about this book before I picked it up from my library. And am I glad I did? Absolutely! This is a beautiful story, not just about horse races; there is so much more to it. First off, I have never heard of water horses, yes they are a mythical creature but still... This book is so much about little things that matter, relationships between siblings, friends. Albeit it's a slow, long read, something which my fast-pace loving brain had to adjust to, but the wait was worth it, every bit of it. I loved Puck and yes, I was surprised after reading a few pages when I got to know something. If you don't read the book blurb like me, you too will be hopefully surprised. It's a good one. Made me turn back the pages and reread. The way Maggie (the author) depicts relationships is very beautiful, so fragile yet so strong. Her writing style is very simple yet powerful. I loved the plot and the way it has been dealt with. This is the first of its kind story I have read. And I liked it. Hopefully I will be reading the 'Shiver' series by Maggie next.",Pragya
9780545224901,"One of these days I will pick up the Mercy Falls series, but for now they sit patiently in my TBR pile. I wasn't aware that Ms. Stiefvater had moved onto greener pastures until I spotted The Scorpio Races on the shelves. The cover was inspirational, and I dreamed of magnificent horse races with a grandiose historical backdrop and a female lead that will do me proud. Let me just say that The Scorpio Races may not be what my dreams were made of - but holy epic of epics, this book packed so much MORE that I forgave it for my tiny disappointment! THE GOOD BITS {Delicious toe-curling romantic tension} The story unfolds with two different narrators, and each have their burdens to bear as they find themselves drawn to each other. Sean knows all too well the allure of the capaill uisce, but he also has had firsthand experience with the vicious and unpredictable deaths these water horses take part in. He does not attend the training sessions for training's sake, but to make sure the foolhardy participants remain in one piece. Especially this year's unexpected participant Puck, who signs up for the sake of saving her family from bankruptcy. Both tend to keep to themselves, but they somehow drift together with their intense determination to win the Scorpio Races. What is a little unusual about this romance is that Sean and Puck never really acknowledge that they liked each other - or went about the usual cycle of ""does s/he like me? do I like him/her?"" They just drifted together, and on the rare occasion that they touched, it was electric. {A win-win ending} Not that the story is TOO perfect and everyone gets to eat and have their cake, but I could not imagine a better conclusion than the one delivered. By the end of it, readers will find themselves torn between Puck and Sean - and while it would be amazing to have them both come out on top of the pack, the story ends better with the one winner. What I appreciated is the aftermath of that brutal race. Puck and Sean may have thought the Scorpio Races was the end-all of their training efforts, but truthfully the Races gave them a better sense of what they wanted and deserved from life. {Capaill uisce} I loved how Maggie Stiefvater imagined these mythological horses into something that works for her. They definitely work for me! They were beautifully ferocious - and, even though they might bite me into little pieces at any given moment, I would so trade up to them from a My Little Pony! THE BAD BITS {Slow canter toward the Scorpio Races} The prologue seems a little misleading. It starts off in the midst of the Races, drenched in adrenaline, breath held to see what would happen - and when something tragic struck, a certain pace had been set and I expected it to cannonball into Chapter 1. However, the story slows down considerably - and with it the immediate excitement for the Races. The Scorpio Races works as is and builds the momentum up to the inevitable climax, but if you are expecting a fast-paced read, this is not one of those books. THE OVERALL The Scorpio Races is made of EPIC - full of awesome and fearsome - and marks Maggie Stiefvater as one to watch because, if this is the direction she wants to take us after werewolves and faeries, then I will gladly follow!",theEPICrat
9780755392285,"First I have to say that I can't guarantee the absence of imaginary smiley faces in this review (sorry, Ellie)! Jennifer E. Smith's books are mostly about the things in life we cannot grasp. In THE STATISTICAL PROBABLITY OF LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, she booked a flight for two teens to explore the ways of fate. And now with THIS IS WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE, readers all around the world are invited to join the search for true happiness. Finding answers to the question of happiness wasn't always easy for Ellie. She's living a quite and very guarded life with her mother in a coast small town until one day she gets an e-mail by a stranger. That stranger would be Hollywood beau Graham Larkin. And Graham, too, doesn't feel like his life is on perfect course. Always on the move, making movies, pretending to be someone he will never be and missing his parents. When he comes to Ellie's town to make a new movie, things start to look brighter than before. Both characters complement each other in the best ways possible. Thankfully Graham isn't, as some might assume, a spoiled or arrogant brat. He is very down-to-earth and receptive for other people's sentiments or problems. Just as Ellie is a very honest person who cares very much for the people she loves. Jennifer E. Smith explores the chances of a relationship between an ordinary girl with a secret and a big actor, the differences between Hollywood versus small-town life and the difficulties in drawing a line between public and private interests. And all along she gives Ellie and Graham a lot of time to get to know each other in a setting that felt very cozy and atmospheric. The chapters alternate between Ellie and Graham and that was just perfect! I had feared they would stay in e-mail contact for a long time wondering who the other person might be and was relieved and happy to see that they met very early in the story so that there was enough room to develop their non-online relationship. But I also loved that their actual conversations were still supplemented with their e-mail contact even after they had met. And the e-mails in general, receiving an e-mail by a stranger and falling for him? Totally loved that! The story as a whole didnt meet all of my expectations. It's hard to explain what was lacking, because I did like THIS IS WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE very much. I might have imagined the romance to be more intense and conflict-laden and the pace to be a bit more explosive. The story wasn't as over the top as some YA contemporary novels feel the need to be today, which was totally okay with me, but some tiny spark was just missing. So I only had to read the e-mail teaser on the back of my proof copy to know that this book would be a keeper! Ice cream, sunrises and flip flops, swimming, dogs and pyjama pants are things meaning happiness for me, too. After reading Jennifer's book I will hopefully learn to pay more attention to the things that make me happy every day. Happiness is keeping the best memories and most beloved people close to you. THIS IS WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE is cuddly and sweet, but despite its high cuteness factor, it should still be taken as a seriously good and meaningful read. 4/5 **** THIS IS WHAT HAPPY LOOKS LIKE - Uplifting, heartfelt and charming! This book is like all sunrises, sunsets and puppies combined, really cute. Jennifer E. Smith is a safe bet should you ever be in need of YA books that raise your spirits, provide you with lovely romance and put you in a summery cheerful mood.",MissPageTurner
9780142422953,"What I liked most about this book was Allyson. The transformation she makes throughout the book is so satisfying. I could really relate to her. At the beginning, she's all introverted and regimented, but she forces herself to open up and become the version of herself she wants to be. Only the first half of the book focuses on her day with Willem, which is something I also really liked. The rest of the book is about what Allyson takes away from that experience--for better and worse. It's about her personal growth. I've never been to Paris and I haven't read a lot of travel-related books. It was interesting to jump on board of Allyson's international adventure. I kind of wish I knew a little bit more about Paris, though. I think I would have connected better with Allyson's physical journey if I had. (One day I'll make it to Paris.) Forman is such a great writer. She writes such realistic and interesting teenagers. I love her writing style. Although my favorite book of hers is still If I Stay, this is an enjoyable and cute read too. I'm interested to figure out Willem's journey during that year, so I'll have to check out the companion novel called Just One Year. I really liked If I Stay's companion novel Where She Went, so I have high hopes for this companion novel too!",Ryann Dannelly
9780755384037,"I've always wanted to fall in love at the airport. I love airports to an extent that may be considered borderline creepy. There are so many things happening at an airport. Loved ones saying goodbye, loved ones saying hello. I love watching the planes taking off, wondering where they are going to. I love watching people racing around, deciding whether or not they are going somewhere interesting or if they are just catching a plane home. My favourite film, Love, Actually, has a beginning and an ending at an airport. The great film The Terminal is set in an airport. There's something mysterious about airports, and I'm determined to find out what makes it so mystical. And that's where my new favourite book of 2012 begins. I recently flew home to Australia for the Christmas holidays, and with my imaginative mind, I must admit I was kind of hoping I'd meet some gorgeous Brit on the journey and have five, wonderfully blissful weeks touring Australia's South West. Alas, that didn't happen, but I still had my flight back to find romance! It wasn't quite the romance I had in mind, but I saw this book in the bookshop at the airport and fell in love immediately. Heavens, I fell in love when I first heard about the book on Goodreads! A sweet and quirky love story about how two people meet in an airport and spend a flight from America to England together only to be separated as soon as they land at the airport? That alone got me hooked straight away. TSPOFIL was a fantastic read, and I'm not just saying that because I spent 14 out of the 21 hours I was flying back to the UK reading the book. Yes, there was a particular romantic notion about reading a book to do with airports and planes and London. This novel was written in an interesting way. Whilst it was in third person, it was in the present, meaning we could see what was happening as it happened - the first line of the novel begins, Airports are torture chambers if you are claustrophobic. That gives us an indication - quite a humorous one at that - of what this book is going to be like. And from then on, I promise you will be hooked. Hadley is definitely not happy with the fact that her father left. She's not happy either that he's remarrying, and she has to fly all the way to London to be a bridesmaid to a woman she automatically detests. Hadley as a character seems quite insecure because of the decisions her parents made to split up, and as such she has a bit of a negative outlook on life. The good thing is, however, that with encouragement, she does see the positives, and that's where Oliver comes in. British Yale student Oliver, who is the most charming guy I've read about in the modern YA world (because let's face it, there's no one more charming than Will Herondale, he just takes the cake on that front!). While quite mysterious, even at the end of the book (we don't truly find out what he's studying at Yale), Oliver is a quirky character and quick on the mark, with comments like, 'I'm studying the fermentation process of mayonnaise.' Plus he's got a cheeky smile! While the book is only set in a 24 hour time frame, everything happens at a steady pace, and nothing is crammed in. And I also love the fact that not everything in the book happens at the airport or on the plane. There's only so much you can do there, and you also get to see how the wedding between her Dad and 'that British woman' plays out. Plus you are left wondering what happens between Hadley and Oliver.... The relationship between Hadley and her Dad is concentrated on a lot more than that between Hadley and her mother, mainly because it's that relationship that was broken when her father decided to leave them for an Englishwoman. Hadley has a hard time grasping the fact that her father has built a new life for himself, leaving her and her mother behind, and for Hadley, it's tough to reconcile with the person that just upped and left. While it was great to read the flashbacks about Hadley and her father's past, I kind of wished there was a bit more about the mother as well, and more on her feelings on the divorce rather than the ""I've accepted it and moved on"" road that Smith took. Who would have guessed that four minutes could change everything? That's the ending sentence in the prologue. And if that holds any weight, I think I'm going to consider 'missing' my flight home in May.",Hannah
9780061214707,"Least favourite of the series, I only continued reading because it was necessary for the following books. The characters in the first book were definitely a lot more defined and allowed readers to be engrossed into their life...

9780061214707,"Torn up inside after her drug-dealer brother betrays her in the most horrible way, Leslie puts on a brave front with her friends, pretending her drunken dad isn't letting the bills pile up and hiding all her pain. Hoping to take back control over her body, she decides to get a tattoo, and picks out a special design at the tattoo parlor she often hangs out at. Unbeknownst to Leslie, that tattoo is the symbol of Irial, the king of the faerie Dark Court, designed to allow him to filter the unpleasant emotions that feed his court through her into him and his people. As Leslie finds her vision changing and her feelings shifting in unpredictable ways, Niall, a faerie of the Summer Court who has always admired her, steps in, hoping to help her and keep Irial away. He has his own tangled feelings about Irial, whom he once counted as a friend. But as Leslie sinks further under Irial's thrall, enjoying the escape from the hurt and fear she'd been living with, only she can decide when to pull away--or whether she would rather stay with him, after all. INK EXCHANGE is a darkly imaginative novel set in the same world as Marr's first novel, WICKED LOVELY. Readers will enjoy exploring the lives of some of that novel's minor characters and seeing more of the shadowy side of the faerie courts. They may find Leslie, Niall, and Irial less engaging than the spirited and perhaps more sympathetic narrators of WICKED LOVELY, but the trio still make for a fascinating ""love"" triangle as each deals with conflicting emotions and tries to decide what is right both for him or herself and for those who are counting on them. The imagery is striking and evocative, and the politics of the different faerie courts is intriguing to explore. A great book for dark fantasy fans.",TeensReadToo
9780061214707,"The more you read the series the deeper you get into the world of Summer courts and Winter courts and Kings and Queens....I certainly now have had a great introduction with these books into any further faerie courts etc books I read. Seth ..sigh...hang in there he does make an appearance...sigh. This is mainly the story of Leslie whose life wasn't the best in so many wrong ways and how she gets mixed up in the world of Faerie. I thought it was very cleverly written. More characters are introduced. Niall and Irial I really like. The one thing I have learnt is nothing is set in concrete in the world of Faerie. Things can shift. There are many difficulties for Aislinn, Keenan and Seth. Irial I found a rather smexi character. Niall is a honest through and through kinda guy...he lays it on the table whether you like it or not. I liked the whole Ink Exchange idea..very clever.",Michelle Auricht

9780064407311,"Sixteen-year-old Steve is on trial for murder. But he's having trouble understanding why. ""What did I do? I walked into a drugstore to look for some mints, and then I walked out. What was wrong with that? I didn't kill Mr. Nesbitt""(p. 140). Nothing is wrong with that, of course--unless the purpose of that casual trip was to give the ""all clear"" for a robbery that ended in the murder of the store's owner. Then, something is very wrong. By structuring the book as a movie script being written by the character as he spends his days in prison, faces his jury, prepares with his lawyer, confronts his mother and father, and, most importantly, examines his own life, Myers presents Steve as a talented young man who may have made a single poor choice. However, Myers retains conflict necessary for building a compelling storyline by having Steve refuse to acknowledge his part in Mr. Nesbitt's death. The result is that the reader wants to sympathize with the teen, but cannot help but wonder, if Steve truly does not understand why what he did was wrong, what is going to keep him from going astray in the future? Maybe, as the prosecutor stated, Steve really is a monster. Overall, MONSTER sends an excellent message to young adults: You, and only you, are responsible for the choices you make, and the consequences for those choices may ultimately affect not only the rest of your life, but the lives of the people around you--and maybe those you do not even know. Therefore, think about what you are doing, consider the consequences of your actions, and choose wisely.

9780525423645,"Oh my God... Have you read a book that you just can't stop reading? Can't stop thinking about it? Even dream about it? Matched is definitely that kind of book. At first, it started slow, because the author want us to understand Cassia and her world. Cassia is a naive girl who follows the rules without thinking about it. In her world, divorces doesn't, or cancer, thanks to the Society. Everything in her world is perfect. The Society gives you your food delivered every day at your home, they decide your work, and even the person you are going to be Matched for the rest of your life. They decide when you will marry, and have kinds, and how many of them. It sounds wrong, but thanks to that, everything is perfect. It's not as the world from before, where people do whatever they wanted and nothing worked. People died of cancer or sickness, and suffered. People never knew when they will die. So, Cassia believes in the Society. Why wouldn't you? Besides, it's not so awful as you think. She got to choose her dress for the most important day of her life, when she will finally discover the identity of the person who is going to be her match. But what will happen when her match is someone she knows? When she discover another boy could be her match? And when her heart chose the wrong guy? Cassia started being innocent and ended being independent and intelligent. She wakes up and finally starts to see things different. She begins to wonder, why? Why can they decide their food? Or their partners? Or their work? Or what to do with their free hours!? It's, in the end, a love story, where the protagonists have to fight themselves and everyone else to be together. But it's also more than that, it's about growing up, and discovering your perfect life is all a lie. It's more than original, and I was amazed by the world the author created. It's way more closer to reality that we want to believe, which is scary. Do you know how many people live their lives the way someone else make them? Without even knowing? Or what is worse, knowing? Overall, I was so impressed by this book that I believe you should read it. Everyone should read it. Kids, teenagers, adults. In schools, universities, homes. Everywhere in the world. Really. Go and buy it!",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9780525423645,"In the Society where Cassia grew up, everything was decided for her. The Officials decide where people work, when people will die, even who people will love. But all of this seems right to Cassia. After all, this is all needed in order to live a long, fulfilling life. The Matching ceremony where teens find out who they are matched with is a big deal. And when Cassia's best friend turns out to be her match, she knows that the system works. Until she sees another boy's face flash on the screen for just a split second. And now she is torn between Xander and Ky. One boy will lead her towards the life she's always known - and the other will lead her toward an unknown life of passion. Which path should she choose? Which path WILL she choose? Wow, can you imagine living in a world where everything is decided for you? What you wear, what your job is, who you love, the age that you can have kids by, what you eat, when you die? Ally Condie paints this world in such vivid words that you can perfectly imagine it. And it's slightly creepy. I don't think I would do well in a world where everything is decided for you and you have almost no choices. I really enjoyed all of the characters in the story. I love how Cassia grows so much from the beginning until the end of the story when she is questioning the ways of the Society. And Xander and Ky are both such great guys. Usually in stories where the girl is trying to decide between two boys, I find myself leaning towards liking one boy more than the other. But not so in MATCHED. I think I liked Xander and Ky equally. Neither of them had any bad qualities. If I had one complaint about this book, it's that the middle got a little slow for me. I think it plod along and some of the story could have been told more quickly. That being said, though, the ending definitely left me wondering what happens next. I can't wait for the sequel!

I fell completely in love with the story and the characters and I think I'm ready for a re-read already (which I rarely do!) Cassia is a strong female lead that had followed the Society's rules set out for her for her whole life. When she starts falling for Ky, and her Grandfather dies and leaves her something special and forbidden, she starts questioning all those rules. She was funny and flawed, and someone I really connected with. The world created was great as well. The thought of a group of overseers controlling everything you do, what you read, what you eat, who you marry, where you work, is completely terrifying. When it came to a scene where they were incinerating books I almost cried...lol. Overall, this was a thought-provoking, powerful, and very entertaining read that I thoroughly enjoyed. I can't wait to read what Ally Condie comes up with next and I recommend this book to everyone!",Reading Angel
9780525423645,"Ally Condie if you're out there reading this....will there be a sequel? This book has been talked about and hyped up all over the blogosphere and I couldn't wait to read it for myself. Now that I have I can say I know why it's been talked about at the volume that is has been. I loved it! Well, I loved it if there's a chance for a sequel, if this is a stand alone I'm very sad and without getting into spoiler zones that's all I can say. Because I'd never read any of Condie's previous works I wasn't sure what to expect, but after reading her work you can't help but see she has a talent for this type of career in spades. The dystopian world she created in Matched is very unique and terrifying, and at the same time it's of course strangely fascinating. The idea of having the Society select your perfect match for each individual sounded like such a romantic idea to me at first. Condie describes the events leading up to the matching and the characters are all so excited and nervous, it was incredibly suspenseful. After a while though, the romantic aspects of the situation fade and the controlling nature of the act presents itself. Boo to the Society! Condie kept with the typical elements and key components necessary for a dystopian novel but at the same time she was able to make it very much her own. The struggle Cassia goes through as she realizes that her perfect life may not be so perfect after all is very sad. She's not alone of course but here is where I may not agree with other readers. Cassia struggles with her feelings for two different boys and her love for both of them is poignant. I was kind of rooting for one boy and I'm thinking there's a good chance the majority will be rooting for the other. Only time will tell but you'll have to pick up the book to see for yourself who you think is right for Cassia and what you think she should do about all of it. I loved Matched and Condie's writing and I'm crossing my fingers to see more of these characters in the future.",Katelyn
9780142410974,"Up until now, THE TRUTH ABOUT FOREVER has always been my favorite Sarah Dessen book. Now that I've read JUST LISTEN, however, I think there's a tie! The characters of this latest release are so honestly real, their dialogue perfectly placed, that you can't help but be pulled into the life and times of Annabel Greene. Of course everyone thinks that Annabel has the perfect life. She's a model who has been in television commercials, in print ads, and in fashion shows at the local mall. She's popular at school, even if it is mostly because she's best friends with Sophie, the high school girl who demands attention. Her father is an architect who designed their house of glass; her mother lives for Annabel's modeling; she has two older sisters, Kirsten and Whitney, who are both former models themselves. Under all of that perfection, of course, lies the real Annabel. The one who suffered from something so horrible at the end of the last school year that she's lost not only her best friend, but her self-respect. Her family is so consumed with Whitney's eating disorder, with Kirsten's college life far away in New York, with keeping everything under control that Annabel doesn't tell them what's happened--the things that are still happening every day she goes to school just dreading the day. She doesn't want to add more problems to the mix; in fact, she lies by omission, simply avoiding the truth rather than shattering her family's illusions. But then Annabel meets Owen Armstrong, a boy she once watched punch out another student, then calmly walk away. Owen keeps to himself, never seems to be without his iPod, and doesn't appear to need any friends. But after he reaches out a hand to her, literally, after she's sick outside of school one day, a budding relationship of friendship begins to build between the guy who never lies, no matter what--and the girl who lies to protect other's feelings, namely her own. I loved JUST LISTEN. Owen is a character that will immediately grab your interest, especially with lines like ""...for me, not saying how I feel when I feel it is a bad move. So I don't do it. Look at it this way: I might be saying you're fat, but at least I'm not punching you in the face."" As for Annabel, the things she's holding inside are tearing her apart, and, in the end, it's the strength of her sisters that gets her to ask for help. The characters of Kirsten and Whitney are complicated and complex, and I have to admit that there's a part near the end of the book in which the sisters come together that had me crying like a baby. As for Annabel, it's not all about telling the truth, but about listening, not just to others, but mostly to that voice inside of her: ""...this is what happens when you try to run from the past. It doesn't just catch up: it overtakes, blotting out the future, the landscape, the very sky, until there is no path left except that which leads through it, the only one that can ever get you home."" *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781402262272,"I really enjoyed this book! The characters are fun and truthful and most of all true to themselves. I love how Jordan is determined to get a football scholarship even though she would be subjected as being a girl quarterback. Her relationship with Jordan is a wonderful example of best friends and I quite loved how they were so comfortable together. It was pretty obvious that Sam was in love with her. It was sweet, and as much as Ty was such a hottie and a good guy I was definitely gunning for Henry! Can I just comment on the very realistic eating habits of these teenage football players??

9781402262272,"Catching Jordan makes me more attached to the Young Adult (YA) Contemporary genre. This book and everything like this book is the reason why I've been shuffling through YA contemporary romances. I just can't get enough and now I have to find another book to fawn over! This was a wonderful novel about a female quarterback star going through Highschool, trying to figure out how to be a girlfriend, play some football and impress some recruits to get into an epic football program in college. I simply adored the storyline, the protagonist, her team (filled with guys) and her best friend. Jordan is the perfect character that teenage girls, who are tomboyish, can relate with. You know what they say, connecting with the readers is everything. And at this point, Miranda Kenneally has nailed it! No matter how hard I try to put the book down, I couldn't. The book was a breeze to get through. The writing style and dialogue is perfect for its target audience and was incredibly clean and easy to read. The plot was unpredictable. The characters, Jordans friends, her brother and even her parents, were so easy to connect with that made it hard for me to pick my favorite character. Yea, it's that hard sometimes. Though there were lots of hilarious characters there were some that really infuriated me. The big one being Tyler Green. You'll have to find out why he was my least favorite yourself by picking up the book. Catching Jordan is an absolutely wonderful book for teens especially when you're down in the dumps and you'd like to pick yourself up again. A definite comfort read for those who'd like to step out of their life for a bit. Personally, it was exactly what I needed. Please, tell me there's a book two!",Najla Qamber
9781402262272,"I never even watched a football game before reading CATCHING JORDAN and now I have absolutely no idea why. The story is already so good, but the football parts make it even better. There are hot football players, practices, actual games, football jargon and the team dynamics we got to experience. Authentic and fun! Isn't it impressive that Jordan Woods is captain and quarterback of an entire football team? A male football team. With totally hot and gorgeous boys! And that position is definitely not undeserved. Jordan is a great player even though she is a girl...because she is a girl. A big part of the story is about Jordan fighting for her chance to get an athletic scholarship and play college football. She is very committed and fights hard for her dream and she's got exactly the combative spirit I'm always looking for in a female protagonist. But as in everyday life it isn't directly easy for Jordan to pursue her dreams. Yep, throw in some prejudices and obsolete ways of thinking. A girl and football aren't equal for some of the characters in CATCHING JORDAN. Her father isn't happy about the situation of his daughter playing football and even other professional people involved with the sport don't take Jordan serious. Time to proof them wrong, right? This story is so much about overcoming the obstacles life throws in your way and just being the person you've always wanted to be. CATCHING JORDAN encourages boys as girls to follow their dreams, regardless how hard it might seem. So now that Jordan is the only girl in an all male football team, the story is very much about being friends with boys, too. There should totally be more stories about that. Jordan's friends and fellow team pals are JJ, Henry and Carter. Probably the most fun and sexy and best friends a girl could have. I loved them as individual characters with very different personalities and their interactions in the group. I'm glad that a girl being their captain wasn't an issue at all. And I really liked how Jordan was already an integrated and highly respected member of the team. The boys are so cute when they want to protect Jordan! Family. Friends...what's missing? The looove story. And CATCHING JORDAN has it, believe me. A really good one by the way. Starting into the new playing season with a new member on the team romantic feelings start invading Jordan's thoughts. And Jordan's thoughts do not only circle around winning the next game anymore, but boys. Boys?! Especially the boys on her team! Here lies another conflict that starts occupying Jodan's mind from now on. There are two boys for Jordan and I want to keep it simple: Henry won my heart!! He is such a cheeky and adorable boy, the best friend and partner a girl could wish for and I really really wanted Jordan to finally see that love has been right in front of her eyes all the time. You are going to love the super cute romance. There are sweet kisses, denial, missed opportunities, hesitant approaches, secret admiring and finally, finally getting the boy who's utterly in love with you for just the right reasons. Miranda's writing is fabulous and full of energy! Not even a ravenous giant of a football player could have losened my fingers from CATCHING JORDAN for a second after I started it. Read it. Read it soon! THE VERDICT CATCHING JORDAN is the awesome debut by Miranda Kenneally that I counted to my favourite YA contemporaries after only a few pages into the story. I'm sure you will love it!",MissPageTurner
9781402262272,"Catching Jordan was such a fun, sporty and hilarious read. i always love it when there is a theme in contemporary novels, such as music, or sports. The book revolves around Jordan, a senior high school student, who is the school star quarterback for the guy's team, and is GOOD at it, and you know what else? Jordan is a girl. I loved how her teammates respected her, and weren't intimidated by a girl being their leader, but at the same time other people and universities treated her like the poster girl for the team, which frustrated her and I; Even her dad was against her playing reason being he doesn't want her to get hurt. Her dad and older brother both play in teams. While this frustrated me, its how reality is. The author didn't draw a pretty picture of it, in truth sexism and discrimination against women exist, even in the most advanced countries. Now back to the story; What was unrealistic is how her guy friend, Henry, who is 17 like her, sleeps over at her house, in her room, and sleeps on the same bed. What family would allow a hormonal teenage boy to sleepover in their daughter's room is beyond me. What was also brought to my attention is the amount of, lets just say, explicit talk going on in the book. Since Jordan always hangs with the ""boys"" you can guess where the conversations usually end up; so much vulgarity going on, but I guess that's a realistic drawing of how guys are nowadays, unfortunately. The story was cute, fun, and a nice change from how contemporary novels usually are. I loved how strong, confident, and independent Jordan was, but at the same time you get to see her vulnerability, and how hurt she is by her father's rejection to her playing. This book is definitely for older teens; and i hope more books are written with sporty themes, they're just so much fun! Fans of Shut Out by Kody Keplinger should definitely read Catching Jordan by Miranda Kenneally.",Juhina & Farah

9781907411052,"I can't express how much I love this book right now. I am impressed with Veronica Ross. Under the Never Sky has so much going on.The dystopian world Veronica Rossi has created is spectacular. You have a government within Reverie trying to cover up the loss of one of its pods and an attack on Aria, so they send her from her cozy little world into the real. Into the Death Shop. Outside, you have world dying from the Aaether storms. There are different tribes, who fight to survive in the cruel world. There are also people who eat other people, the cannibals, and people with powers, they call senses. There you have Peregrine aka Perry. So original, right? Aria and Perry are people of two completely different words, and collide to form an unlikely allegiance. At first, they think of each other as barbaric and wild or soft and protected but the closer they get to each other, the more on edge you would feel. I can honestly say that this book was magical. This is no insta-love. No No. The romance went just like I wanted. Slowly developing and then BAM. Some other authors should learn from Mrs. Veronica. Also, I loved the other characters through the story. Roar was a great character, Marron also. I was suprised with Cinder. And Vale... can't say much about him. I DID NOT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN WITH HIM AT THE END OF THE BOOK. So, there you have it. A perfect dystopian world. Perfect romance. Great characters. So many ""I did not expect that to happen"" scenes. Under the Never Sky goes to my TOP 5 Dystopian books.

But then her mother is sent away for work reasons to the Bliss pod while there Aria can't get speak to her though her smart eye and starts to worry over it so she decides to get her own answer's from Soren as his father is very high up in Reverie but things go from bad to worst when Soren turns on her and Perry saves her. Perry is a savage from outside and once he saves Aria he leaves before he is caught in side Reverie. When Aria is found she is questioned by Soren father and tricked by him and then dumped all only in outside when Perry comes along and finds her he demands aria help him get Talon his brother's son back because he has walked out of his tribe the Tides. We then follow the story of Aria & Perry both looking for there love ones and the touble they go through with learning to get along together also the other tribes from outside and the Aether storms. As the world as we know is now full of Aether storms which are like lighting but burn everying it touches. The sky is now red and blue.I loved the journey Aria and Perry take and how you see there relonship bulid up and how Rossi tackled the subject of teen sex in a way that made you go ahhhh I love Aria and Perry together. Tellling the book from both the POV's was awesome I liked how you got to see what both of them are thinking. Also Rossi's side characters where great and I enjoyed reading about them too especialy Roar & Cinder. Veronica Rossi 2012 YA debut is a compelling dystopian read unlike any other I have read. Rossi world building is amazing not only did she create one world but another one that's living right next to it. I loved both Reverie and outside for different reasons and some of the same. I loved Reverie for the realms were you can create want you want but it's mutidimensional Aria says ""not like watching a video your atually part of the realm you choose"". Also I really liked the whole idea of the dwellers having the smarteye. Outside was great because it was so different to the realms I loved the Savage/tribe and even liked the idea that if you are not part of a tribe your are dispersed.I really liked how some memembers of the tribe has special powers as in seers,auds and extra sensentive hearing Perry is special as he has this hearing as well as being a seer. If you are looking for your next dystopian read make it Under The Never Sky it is truly worth the read. I loved it and can't wait for book #2 ""Through The Never Night"".",laura Cresswell
9781907411052,"I am a big fan of the dystopian genre, at least of the ideas behind them. Unfortunately a lot of them can be a little poorly written and feel rushed. Thankfully, Under the Never Sky was a book with both a good idea and good writing behind it. Rossi obviously has a vivid imagination and has managed to build a complex world and group of characters. We are thrown into Rossi's dystopian world straight away. My only main issue with this book was that this book is quite confusing at the beginning and it wasn't until around the mid-way point that I really began to understand everything. Not everything was explained which was, in a way, good as it helped us to adapt to the terms and the world ourselves. I did find the world-building to be strong and it was very different to the world we live in now. There was a lot to take in, but it never got boring. Getting past the start was a little slow as I did have to try and remember several people and figure out a lot of things for myself, but this certainly wasn't a slow book in terms of action though. There were plenty of twists and turns, many of which I wasn't expecting. This book managed to keep me on edge right until the end, which was fantastic and quite a rare treat! There are so many things that we find out during this first book, we are constantly discovering more. Through the actions of the characters and the events that happen around them, we get to learn more about both them and the environment around them. The setting is extremely intriguing and I can imagine that we'll get to learn even more in the next books. The setting is in two main areas - Aria's home, Reverie, and where Perry lives, the Outside, or the outer wastelands. Reverie is least like our modern day as it is protected, generated and very modified, inhabitants included, to be at it's 'optimum', because of this, Aria is out of touch with our reality - for example, she doesn't she doesn't even know what real weather feels like. In complete contrast to Reverie, the outside, where most of this book is set, is more of a wild place where you must fend for and look after yourself. Reverie isn't completely 'normal' though, it feels like it's set more in the past, as well as some of the inhabitants having heightened power of their senses. They also live under an Aether, which covers the sky and causes constant danger. Our main characters are two very different people, Aria and Peregrine (Perry). They are both very strong, bold characters and by the end, I had them very well formed in my mind. The relationship between them felt natural in their situation. The romance that built between them didn't dominate the story and it wasn't instant, which I was very glad about. It was great to see how their relationship progressed throughout their time together. Both characters go through a lot of mental changes, and Aria also goes through several physical changes. All of it felt very authentic and well thought out. There are several other characters who in this book, including Vale (Perry's brother) and his son Talon, and his friends Marron, Roar and a young boy that they found in the woods - Cinder. Cinder has such a good basis for even more development and I really hope that he is featured more in the next book(s). This book has very frequent twists and it's hard to review this book without giving much away, but I don't want to spoil the book if you're planning on reading it yourself, and this is something that I think you should read for yourself. I'm pleased that I've read this as it was a lot more complex than a lot of other books that are on the market today and it wasn't completely based around romance. I think that Under the Never Sky will definitely appeal to a lot of fans of young- adult dystopian stories and I would certainly recommend it. I am already looking forward to the next book in the series, Through the Ever Night, to see what I will discover!",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)

9780316051583,"I can appreciate why this book is as popular as it is. It's a heart-rending story, filled with secrets, heart-break, lost love and self-exploration. It's easy to read, hard to put down and sports a very likeable character in Anna. With all that said, I hate to say anything negative about it, but I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about how this story made prudish me squirm a bit. I mean, for all of Anna and Frankie's growth, as friends and as women, there was a lot of backsliding happening. The lies, the deceit, the clueless parents and the rush to lose her virginity made me more than a little uncomfortable. That said, I wouldn't be on the bandwagon calling for the book to be banned, but I might think twice about recommending it lightly. For a debut novel, don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful book and I think Sarah Ockler really captured some of the angst that teenagers deal with when coping with loss and grief, I just wish there would have been a little less about boys and a little more about the family/friends dynamics.",Lydia Presley

Little does Frankie know, Anna has already had her perfect summer romance. It was last summer, with Matt. Before Frankie knew about it, Matt had died. He was to tell her on their vacation, and Anna had promised not to say anything. And she has still kept that promise. This story was amazing. It was so hard to put it down. It is a perfect read to start off the summer. I really enjoyed Anna's character, and by the end of the novel, you could really tell how much she changed.

But now for the book. Generally speaking Angelic books bring me deception, as either it's a human girl falling for an angel who happens to be a warrior swoops her away with his amazing looks and wings, whereas the female is annoying; or even worse the angel isn't a warrior at all. But this book was amazing, true the angels weren't exactly warriors, but they weren't the epitome of goodness. Willow is a great protagonist and her development and how she comes to accept who and what she truly ism is realistic inside the fact that this is a paranormal book were talking about. Alex, sigh what about him, he's the male character, he's completely human (or at least I think so) but also strong young boy who has suffered allot in life and who's main goal is to destroy the angels. The angels are the main antagonists in this book, particularly Raziel who has his own secret (although I suspected it half way through the book) I loved how the love in between Alex and Willow develops slowly and how they both learn to accept that there is good things and bad things about each other. And I was really sad about Cully. My only problem with this book was the jumping in between characters POV, but apart from that excellent choice Jean^^",Nathiel Gold

9781409521969,"The story is not very original. I've recently read something very similar by Danielle Trussoni, titled Angelology. This book won't get high marks for originality. But despite being in a congested genre, L.A. Weatherly puts a nice spin on a tired tale and gave us a beautiful story which would make a reader come back looking for more! For the same reason I buy Jim Butcher, Ilona Andrews and Patricia Briggs even if their books are in a congested genre too... the reason these authors stand out in a competitive field? Masterpiece story telling quality! And judging by this book, L. A. Weatherly could very well have that too. But we will see with the subsequent books if this will hold true or if this is a one-off thing with this book. The story is narrated in the first person by the protagonists. Halfway into the first chapter, the narration swapped from the female protagonist to the male protagonist narrating the story. About a couple of pages after the male protagonist started telling the story, the author seemed to slightly loose perspective and the narration went from the first person to third person. This is confusing to read. I had to go back and re-read a few pages a couple of times to make sure that I am still reading about the same characters. I thought that a new set of characters were being introduced which wouldn't exactly surprise me since the book seems to be in a ""introducing characters"" mode at this point... only to realise that, no, these are the same characters mentioned a few pages back... And this change in narration perspective without warning is repeated a few times through out the book which is a little disorienting... a slight annoyance but forgivable. My copy is an ARC so the cover is plain. But I had a little look at amazon for the final cover art and it is disappointing. If I was browsing the shelves of a bookstore, this cover art wouldn't register in my ""buying radar"" at all. Although it did depict the story nicely, it could also seriously use a bit of an artistic input from the likes of Tony Mauro and Gene Mollica. By the way Willow is blonde, not brunette, as might otherwise be suggested by the cover art. I enjoyed this book and am eagerly waiting for the next two books, Angel Heat to come out in May 2010 and Angel Burn to come out in October 2011.

There are people there that say they are her parents, and another woman that is her grandmother. Left with the video disks of her life, she starts to watch and ponder ""Who is Jenna Fox?"" There has been an accident, but no one will talk to her about the details. As she slowly heals, Jenna questions everything and starts to fill in gaps. After a little while of recovery, she pushes to go to school and begins to attend a local charter school. There she meets an odd assortment of classmates. Alice has medical issues of her own, and starts to explain the federal ethics board to Jenna. Each person is allotted 100 lifetime points to be used for medical reasons. Alice has prosthetic limbs and explains that limb replacement is relatively low on the point scale. Other procedures would be worth much more. Dane is a neighbor but something seems off with him. When Jenna looks in his eyes, he seems empty. And then there is Ethan. He's hiding a dark secret of his own. As Jenna discovers the world around her, the secrets and mysteries that are her life slowly start to be revealed. Remembering what Alice has explained about the lifetime points, Jenna comes to realize that there are even deeper secrets about her that she must uncover. Her parents have moved her from Boston to California. Is it to protect her from those that were involved with the accident? Or does it have more far-reaching medical and ethical implications? Without wanting to give away the plot twists and hidden mysteries of the story, I will tell you that the issues Ms. Pearson raises will cause you to ponder how far science should be allowed to explore. As Jenna tries to discover, the reader will also be forced to wonder how much of us do we need to keep us truly human? Ms. Pearson makes the reader question if it's truly the flesh and blood that makes us human, or if there is something further inside that gives us our identity. Comparing the lack of emotion that Dane has with Jenna's unwavering questioning of everything, it shows the reader that things are not always black and white.

The characters are still quite likable but the story sort of faltered for me. I'm glad that the reader could see into their past lives (mainly Luce's) and what got them to where Daniel and Luce are today, but the ""time jumping"" was not fun to follow. Luce was far more stubborn in her quest for the truth and didn't care if she altered time to achieve what she set out to do. It made me want to reach into the book and strangle her or slap the crap out of her. As for Daniel, he was valiant as always, but always a day late, a dollar short. I kept hoping he would have gotten to her over and over again just to get the time jumping over with. What I really wanted to know is what happened with the other travelers. We saw briefly what happened to Shelby and Miles and a few seconds of Cam, but what happened when they traveled through time? Overall, it was, as always, a great novel by an amazing writer.

9780439922333,"Let me start out by saying that DOES MY HEAD LOOK BIG IN THIS? is a book that needed to be written, and one that needs to be read. It definitely fills a gap in young adult literature: it's a story about a normal Muslim girl in a non-Muslim country (Australia) who is not escaping oppression by a fundamentalist government/family or anything like that. Amal is just a normal teenage girl, albeit a Muslim one. She has crushes on boys, she likes to go shopping, she giggles with her friends, and she sometimes argues with her parents or feuds with classmates. However, Amal's life is changed drastically when she makes a major decision: to wear the hijab, the head scarf worn by Muslim women. This would not be nearly such a big deal were she still at school with all of her friends who are also Muslim and some of whom wear the hijab full-time (meaning: whenever she is around men who are not relatives) as well. However, Amal has recently transferred to a very white-bread prep school, where the environment is completely different. Amal is subjected to racism and discrimination by kids whose experience with Muslims has largely been confined to what they see in the media. The reactions she faces at home are not all positive, either, but Amal has made a choice. To her, it is a personal, religious decision, to show her devotion to God; it's not about being oppressed as some of her classmates seem to think, or making any sort of statement. Being a Muslim is a part of who Amal is, but in showing that, she faces things a lot worse than any evangelical Christian I know, and that's a sad commentary on our society. All of that aside, Randa Abdel-Fattah's book is very well-written, and I loved Amal's voice. The characters in this book (particularly Amal) were great. DOES MY HEAD LOOK BIG IN THIS? is actually a little reminiscent of the wonderful LOOKING FOR ALIBRANDI by Melina Marchetta, and that's high praise, indeed!

9780312379834,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. After reading the first three House of Night novels, I really liked this one because it seemed like it took the series down a more mature path. In Untamed, it's noticeable that the characters are growing up. They haven't really grown up in the getting older sense, but by the situations they have faced and the hardships they've gone through in a few short months. In another true sense of maturing and growing, this novel, as well as the last, have gotten more intense and sexual. I'm not saying that a novel has to be sexual for me to enjoy it, but to me it makes the characters seem more realistic. What teenager doesn't deal with lust, envy, and...well, sex. The majority of today's youth are losing their virginities while in their teenage years. Zoey is a little bit of a goody-goody, but she shows the vulnerable sides a lot of teenage girls have to face and fight to control. Boys. And boy, is she vulnerable... This novel also starts to put the series in a darker light. With evil hidden in secrecy, death upon more death, and bloody, gruesome acts of violence, things are getting more serious...and dangerous. It draws the reader in and makes them wonder 'just what the hell is going to happen?'. All in all, this novel was definitely better than the last and even better than the one before it. The House of Night series is one that is quick and easy to read. My husband and I have sped through these books with an intensity like no other, and we both have come to the same conclusion. We cannot stop reading them. And we both agree that the more books we read, the better the series gets. So if you're not particularly fond of the first novel, Marked at least give the second a try.

After losing three potential boyfriends, alienating her closest vampyre buddies, and incurring the wrath of her mentor, Neferet, Zoey is on a downward spiral to Loserville. This young high priestess-in-training has a lot on her plate since transferring to the House of Night. Her abilities are creating quite a stir on campus and Zoey is not used to having all the attention on her. Since her recent admittance into the vampyre school, things have changed, and not for the better. Professors are being murdered, fledglings are disappearing, and Neferet has declared war on all humans. Stevie Rae, Zoey's best friend, has been transformed into another type of vampyre, and Aphrodite, Zoey's one-time nemesis, has regained her humanity, but continues to have life-altering visions. Zoey must use all of her abilities to unite those who wish to save the House of Night and its loyal inhabitants. The Cast duo has created yet another excellent addition to the HOUSE OF NIGHT series. It is easy to see why these novels have become so popular; the stories are well-written, and the dialogue is at times extremely clever and sometimes biting. Young adult readers can relate to the mundane, everyday-ness of Zoey's activities (i.e.going to class, having arguments with friends, etc.), while losing themselves in the otherworldly aspects of the students' lives. This is a definite must-read for fans of the House of Night! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

The characters are loveable, the action and plot extremely original, and so many awesome twists and turns that you can't help but tell everyone you see about it.",Joseph Quine
9780007314362,"I was initially attracted to this book by the gorgeous cover and once I had read what it was about I was completely intrigued and had to buy it. I was hooked as soon as I started reading and I knew that this would end up as another one day read because I just couldn't put it down! The clear way this book has been written meant that it was easy and comfortable to read, and the storyline was just fantastic - it was so imaginative and different and that is what kept me turning the pages until the end. I liked the friendship between Laurel and David, it was always just on the edge of something more and even by the end you don't fully know where things will go with them. They worked well as a team trying to figure out what Laurel was and what it all meant, this was fun to read especially as everything began to unfold and more details were revealed. Laurel's first meeting with Tamani was great, it was exciting and dangerous and signalled the moment that I had been anticipating most - Laurel discovering what she is. Tamani was very intriguing and Laurel was definitely attracted to him but wouldn't admit it to anyone else. I think this will be the beginning of a fantastic love triangle, at the moment nothing is very clear-cut, she has feelings for them both but hasn't really committed herself to anything so I believe she could still go either way. I look forward to seeing how this evolves in the next book. As I was reading this book I could picture everything so vividly and I think it would make a great movie. The ending was beautiful, it was emotional and left me wanting so much more. Actually that would be the only negative thing I have to say about this book - it went too quickly and I just didn't want it to end. I have already ordered the next book in the series Spells and I can't wait for it to arrive so I can find out what's next for Laurel. This is a magical, different story - a real page turner.",Kate Verrier

9780007314362,Beautifully written debut novel. Aimed at tweens rather than YA but it still contains some adult sexual themes. An unusual and creative take on a faerie story. Lovely nature imagery which worked wonders with my technicolour imagination. Clever use of science to reinforce the plot - it might even encourage tweens to study science ;) Ingenious linking of Shakespearean characters with mythological characters added an extra dimension to the storyline. A heart wrenching ending that lingers in your imagination long after closing the book. A truly enchanting story.,Emma Davies
9780007314362,"Laurel is just your average teenage girl; ok, so she has the looks of a model, the grace of a bird, is up with the sun and has weird (healthy) eating habits, but she is still normal. Right? One morning Laurel wakes to find a zit, her first zit, right in the middle of her back. Although a bit disgusted she also a little relieved, it was normal for teenagers to get zits. But as the days go buy the zit does not disappear, instead it is growing bigger. At some stage Laurel has to admit that this is no normal zit, its something else. At first Laurel is convinced it is a tumour, she has cancer. But as the thing gets bigger and finally reveals itself, Laurel now knows it is not a tumour. But she is not so sure that this is any better. With the help of her friend David, Laurel is about to learn a lot more about herself then she ever knew before. Laurel is not human, she is a fairy. And she is not the only one. There is a whole other world that Laurel is about to learn about, a world of magic and beauty, but also of danger and old enemies. Laurel has to learn to live between two worlds, the world of humans and the world of fairies. This is highlighted between her feeling of being torn between her two friends, a human David and a fairy Tamani; the two boys for whom Laurel has feelings for. It is a story of fairies as you've never seen them before, full of charm, mystery, adventure and excitement. A highly entertaining book that stirs the imagination and leaves you with a sense of wonder. Wings is the first of four books to be published in this new series. I loved this story and not just because it is about fairies. It is a beautiful and warm story that manages to remain innocent despite its violence. A highly recommended read and a stunning debut novel.",Larissa McGrath
9780375856440,"Stargirl would have been enough. I could have lived not knowing what happened to Stargirl after she left Arizona. And I would have been contented. But still I dived into Love, Stargirl because I was curious if she and Leo would ever be together again. By the end of the book, I got the answer. The question now is: Did I regret my decision to read Love, Stargirl? Yes and no. I had a love and hate relationship with Stargirl all the time I was reading the book. Sometimes I wanted to hug and comfort her; other times I just wanted to shake her so hard and pound some sense into her. Don't get me wrong. She's wonderful and kind and unique, but there were times that I just find her frustrating and childish. I mean, she's sixteen but she was acting like a twelve-year-old. I hated the way she acted around Perry. That's not the Stargirl I loved in the first book. That's some silly, lovesick teenager. I really didn't get at all why she got attracted to Perry. They have absolutely nothing in common. Man, how relieved I was when Stargirl finally realized how she really felt. All that aside, I still love Stargirl. (I realize that it's only when she's thinking about and hanging out with Perry that I don't like Stargirl. Pfft. That particular infatuation wasn't cute at all. Team Leo all the way!) I found her friendship with Dootsie really adorable. How many sixteen-year-olds nowadays would be friends with a very energetic six-year-old? Like what Mrs. Caraway said, she's the little sister Stargirl never had. I liked that. It was also good to see how Stargirl affected Alvina in the littlest ways. The change in Betty Lou. The friendship with Charlie. The talk with Arnold. That's the Stargirl I knew. I thought the reason why Stargirl's beginning to sound normal to me was because I was reading from her perspective. Somehow, the novelty of Stargirl disappeared. Or faded, at least. I realized (again!) that she's beginning to sound normal because in her mind, she's perfectly normal. That the things she does are normal. Like marking the sunrise every week for months until Winter Solstice. Or having a pet rat. Or befriending an agoraphobic. Or ""babysitting"" a grumpy eleven-year-old. Or writing the longest letter to the boy who broke her heart. Those are perfectly normal things in Stargirl standards. And they're all amazing and admirable. A lot of things in Love, Stargirl made me tear up. Cinnamon after the fire. (Enough said.) Cinnamon and Arnold. Winter Solstice. (It was overwhelming even though I couldn't see it with my eyes. I felt it.) Stargirl's question to Leo. Leo's answer. (Goosebumps all over!) And the ending! It made me sad and happy and hopeful at the same time. It was a nice kind of sad, though. Just the tiny ache in your chest from all the hope bursting inside you. You know what I mean? That's what I felt. I'm happy that Stargirl got the answer she's been waiting for. And it's an answer that made her happy and at peace with herself and the fact that even though she and Leo are apart now, there's still hope. I don't exactly regret reading Love, Stargirl. I liked it. But as I said, I could live with just Stargirl. While the sequel is also fascinating, I loved and enjoyed the first book more. Nonetheless, Love, Stargirl is still a good read.",Julie Rimpula
9780375856440,"Fans of Jerry Spinelli's STARGIRL will jump and shout when they hear about the sequel, LOVE, STARGIRL. This was not a book that I expected to have a sequel, but in true Jerry Spinelli tradition, Stargirl's story lives on. Moving from Arizona to Pennsylvania has Stargirl missing the desert, the cactus, and especially Leo. Although she is not absolutely certain about their continued relationship, Stargirl uses her year-long letter to keep Leo up-to-date on the events of her new life. She doesn't ever anticipate sending the letter. In fact, she mentions that Leo will most likely only get to read it if she actually sees him again. Filled with fantastic memories and new adventures, Spinelli will have readers falling in love with Stargirl all over again. Memories of the past will remind readers of her wonderful spirit, while her new neighborhoods offer great variety. There's cute and always curious Dootsie, who introduces herself as a ""human bean."" Dootsie takes Stargirl to meet Betty Lou, who fears anything beyond her trailer door. Then there's Charlie, who haunts the local cemetery and his late wife's grave. Alvina, the hot-head, and Perry, the thief, add further color to the cast of characters. Stargirl's fascination with the changing seasons and the Winter Solstice take her to Enchanted Hill to plot her own personal calendar. It feels right and it offers a way to remember the past. Stargirl's tale is tender and honest in its straightforward simplicity. Thank you to the author for bringing back this famous character.",TeensReadToo
9780738710181,"Nearly one year ago Maggie was hit by a car and sustained a major injury to her leg that halted her promising tennis career and leaving her in hospital being home schooled. Caleb, Maggie's neighbour and her best friends brother, was convicted of hitting Maggie while driving drunk and driving off. Maggie had a plan to avoid seeing Caleb before he got released from juvenile detention, go to Spain on exchange, her plan was working fine until Caleb was released early and now with the new school term starting Maggie will have to see Caleb every day at school reminding her of what he did to her. What follows is a beautifully written story about two people who have both been changed by the accident and now must deal with the consequences. I absolutely loved this book! The book switched between the point of view of the two main characters Maggie and Caleb, which I thought really added to the book as we were able to see Maggie's POV of a situation and then we got Caleb POV of the same situation. It was really interesting to see how differently they saw the same situation, particularly where Maggie felt that Caleb was fitting straight back into his old life both at school and with his friends, but from Caleb POV we saw that he felt he didn't fit in there anymore and no one understood him and what he was going through. I really felt for Maggie, before the accident she had good friends and loved playing tennis, after she seems to have lost all of her friends, cannot play tennis anymore and is now an outcast at school because of the accident and her limp. My opinion of Caleb changed throughout the book, at the start I wasn't very enamored with him but as the book progressed and he had to deal with his family, friends and the consequences of his actions I did a complete 180 turn and I was cheering for Maggie and Caleb to make it together. Caleb understood that the accident changed him, and I think for the better. I don't want to give too much away but it is evident early in the book that all is not what it seems, there was more to the accident, but that's all I'll say. The ending of the book was different, it wasn't all tied up with a nice little bow on top there wasn't real closure for Maggie and Caleb as a couple, so depending on if you like closure or not you may not like the ending. That said Maggie was finally able to accept what happened to her especially with what she discovered she felt she could get on with the rest of her life now without having all this anger. Personally, I liked the ending, especially now that there is a sequel coming out this year, I can't wait to find out what happens to Maggie and Caleb next. By lostinstories.blogspot.com",Romy
9780738710181,"Two very different people are joined together by the most common yet dreadful experience. Both live in the town of Paradise, but for them it is nothing like the name. Caleb Becker had spent time in juvenile detention for the crime of driving while intoxicated and accidentally hitting someone with his car. And now that he has done his time, Caleb is able to go home to his family and his girlfriend, if they are still together. But for Caleb, returning to Paradise isn't so easy. His mother is trying to act like nothing has happened, his sister hardly talks to anyone and has went from prep to goth, and his dad is just there. Maggie Armstrong was that innocent person that Caleb hit, and she's been living in her own prison, the hospital. Trying to get back her life, Maggie has been trying her best to walk right again. But during those times, the people who Maggie thought were her friends began to grow apart from her. It's bad enough that her mother is trying to make ends meet and trying to make Maggie happy, but since Paradise isn't such a big town, there's a greater chance of Maggie running into Caleb. For Caleb, it's much easier for him to gain his life back, since he was always the popular one -- but for Maggie, she's closer to the outside. But the one thing they both truly needed wasn't their old friends or their old lives, but each other. That one incident, that one thing that affected both of them, each in a different way, has caused a strong connection between them that they would never be able to ignore. LEAVING PARADISE was honestly an amazing story, and was wonderfully written to where whoever reads it will not be able to get the story out of their head. Simone Elkeles, author of the highly acclaimed HOW TO RUIN A SUMMER VACATION, has switched gears and made an issue that is so common her own and very unique. The relationship between Caleb and Maggie was so real and extremely heartwarming, and the ways that they struggled to continue their lives, both individually and together, makes you wonder if you are able to be as strong as they are. This is another wonderful novel from Simone Elkeles, and I cannot wait to read her future publications.",TeensReadToo

I don't know how the ending of this book could have been more suited for all that had happened. It was an incredible revelation. You see a gang of kids trying to live to their fullest in a time of war and uncertain. You see a ""not so orthodox"" love grow between them and then you see all that happiness shattered and them being little by little pushed to the end of the cliff.

9780142414729,"It's been a quite a long time that I found myself sitting up until three in the morning, wanting desperately to finish a story. But that is exactly where I found myself the other night with LOCK AND KEY in my hands. I was so engrossed in Ruby and her story that I had to find out how it ended. Ruby Cooper has always looked out for Number One. When Ruby was eight, her sister Cora left for university and never looked back. It was always Ruby and her mother, moving from one place to another. Her mother's excuse was to avoid creditors and landlords. Ruby slowly comes to find out that this is the version her mother wanted her to hear. Early on in her senior year of high school, Ruby's mom does a runner. Leaving Ruby all alone in the rented yellow house, Ruby does what she can to survive. She will be eighteen in less than a year, and if she can hide the fact that she's alone until then, the authorities won't be able to touch her. But when the dryer fails at her rented house and the landlords notice a clothes line strung throughout the kitchen, Ruby's life is forever changed. Custody of Ruby is given over to her older sister, Cora. Cora and her husband, Jamie, live in a wealthy community and live a life totally foreign to everything Ruby has ever known. Not trusting Cora and Jamie's intentions, Ruby plots an escape her first night in her new home. Making a break over the fence in the back yard, her escape is foiled by one rambunctious dog, Roscoe. Roscoe's barking brings a curious ""Hello?"" from the other side of the fence. Here she meets her next door neighbor, Nate. Nate's outlook on life is upbeat and infectious. But Ruby does everything she can to keep him at bay, as well. Slowly, Ruby learns to adjust the new life she has been given, and develop friendships in the most unlikely places. Ruby has always kept on the fringes and avoided being indebted to anyone. But as she grows and evolves, she realizes that maybe others need her just as much as she needs them. With a class assignment to define ""Family,"" Ruby understands that the word has many meanings, and most of them don't necessarily mean blood relations. Sarah Dessen writes another amazing novel for young adults. LOCK AND KEY is wonderful, heartfelt story. All of the characters draw you in and make you feel like you are part of their lives. Jamie's naivete is endearing. Cora's infertility struggles hit you in the heart. Olivia's tough girl exterior has cracks you get to see through. Harriett is just as harried as her name implies. And the perfect-seeming Nate has secrets all his own. My only regret with this book is that I failed to move it to the top of my To Be Read pile as soon as it arrived for review. So if you have this one sitting around at home, make it the next one you read. And if you've picked it up at the book store, considering purchasing it, definitely do so the next time you are there.

9780385738750,"After reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner earlier this year, it was inevitable that I would hurry to pick up The Scorch Trials. Before doing so, however, I refreshed my memory with another read-through of The Maze Runner... and I think I liked it even more the second time around. With The Scorch Trials I found it easier to adapt to the world and the ""variables"" being thrown at Thomas and his crew, mostly because of how The Maze Runner had prepared me for them. Dashner does a fantastic job of building the tension and then, just when it gets to the breaking point, throwing in something so random, so out of the blue, that the tension subsides and starts to build in another, different way. What makes The Scorch Trials so different from The Maze Runner is - now that the kids know who WICKED is, they have a bit more knowledge of what is going on - but that still doesn't mean that this book will make complete sense to you, as it doesn't to them. And that is what makes the book so much fun. There is plenty of action, plenty of excitement and I grew even more attached to these characters, these teenagers struggling in a world where hope seems so dead. I cannot wait to get my hands on the last book in this trilogy and next year cannot come soon enough. I haven't felt this much anticipation for a book since Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins - and while the books are somewhat similar, I really appreciate the teamwork Dashner has chosen to implement in The Maze Runner trilogy and think he's doing a fantastic job of telling his story.",Lydia Presley
9780451219947,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm as a part of my 'Old Review' feature. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) I'm going to start with the fact that at the time when I went to read this, I had been in a complete reading rut for a long while, it took me months to read just one book when normally it took me from a few hours to a few days to complete a book, depending on their size. But then I decided to try and get back into my reading and I remembered the Morganville Vampires series. I owned books one through five at the time, and I hadn't read them yet. Except for the fact I started reading Glass Houses a long time ago when I checked it out at the library, but then had to bring it back before I had finished it. I had only gotten not even halfway through. After my birthday one year I decided to order all the books that were currently out in the series with a Books-a-Million gift card I had received. I remembered how much I had loved the bit I had read and so I grabbed Glass Houses, hoping it would be the book to snatch me out of my reading rut. And guess what, it did! The world Rachel Caine has created is so different from the normal worlds of books with vampires in them. Truthfully, it is so hard to find a good vampire book these days with a unique plot and storyline, because sadly most of it has already been used before, which is really sad to a vampire lover like me. When I learned that the town was run by vampires and that all the humans that lived in Morganville knew, it completely blew my mind! And not only that, but the vampires in the Morganville Vampires are bad! Not all of them are, but most. All I can say it that Rachel Caine is brilliant. She has also become an inspiration to my writing, so kudos to her for that as well. I really loved the main characters. Claire kind of annoyed me at first, but later as she started developing more she became more real to me and less annoying. I absolutely love, love, love Eve. And Shane and Michael as well, god they are hot! But Eve is my favorite character. All I can say about Monica though is that I wanted to slap her 99% of the time. I really wish someone would kick her butt. Not only do I love the characters, and basically everything else about this book, but the cover. It's really pretty. I know you should never judge a book by its cover, but a good story should always have a beautiful cover. Am I right? The end of this book ended with a complete cliffhanger. Seriously made my jaw drop and run to my shelf to grab the second book, The Dead Girls' Dance. Sometimes I hate cliff hangers, but in this case I had the next book so it didn't bother me much. Except for the five seconds it took to grab the next installment. Overall, I thought that Glass Houses was a great first edition to the Morganville Vampires series and it's now one of my favorite series. I highly recommend this book. It's a must read for vampire lovers, fantasy lovers and just book lovers. If you haven't read Glass Houses you should really grab a copy of it, or at least borrow it from the library or a friend. You do NOT want to miss out on this book.",Amanda
9780451219947,"All Claire Danvers wanted was a normal college experience. Preferably somewhere far away, but when her parents send her to Morganville, Texas, she's still glad to be going to college, even if she is, at sixteen, the youngest college student around. Morganville is a small college town, and Claire's prepared to make the best of her fresh start. Unfortunately, things don't turn out the way anyone expected or wanted them to. At first, Claire's existence is made miserable by a few girls in her dorm who torment her. Dorm life, for Claire, is not all it's cracked up to be--in fact, it's pretty much as miserable as she thinks it can get, so Claire decides to move out and find a place off-campus. Luck is with her; she ends up at a spooky-looking mansion with a room she can actually afford, and three roommates who actually turn out to be pretty cool, even if they have reservations about letting her move in at first. Michael, Shane, and Eve are all eighteen, and Claire's a couple of years younger. If Claire thought being harassed in her dorm was bad, she didn't know Morganville's secrets. When she moves out of the dorm, however, she learns that there's more to Morganville than there seems to be. The town is run by vampires. Yes, actual vampires that can't go out in the daytime and drink human blood at night. If Claire's not careful, it could end up being her blood they're drinking... GLASS HOUSES is a great book for fans of vampire novels. Claire and her roommates are quite likeable as characters, and, perhaps making the book even better, the bad guys are just as easy to hate as the inhabitants of the Glass House are to like. In Morganville, Rachel Caine has created a mysterious, intriguing, and spooky town run by the undead (I was a bit reminded of Buffy's hometown of Sunnydale). The writing is great, and there are few flaws in this awesome book. Claire doesn't ask nearly as many questions as might be expected of someone who had just been let in on the secret that she's living in a town run by vampires; it seems like that might be a way of keeping some questions and suspense in the story, but it struck me as a bit unrealistic while reading.

9781439178232,"First of all, as a fan of book covers, I have to say that the one for Forget You is one of the most gorgeous covers ever. And it does count a lot when you're at the bookstore looking at the shelves, covers like this simply shine and catch you instantly. As a fan of Going Too Far-and now probably as an eternal fan of Jennifer Echols and her writing-, I feel imensely happy for having loved and enjoyed Forget You more than I thought I would, though as I read I admit I was wanting more than what we have. I was so strongly mesmerized by this novel that I could not put it down last night, and it was just when I looked out of the window to the sky that I realized the sun had already rised and it was today's morning. Jennifer Echols' writing is never tiring! Living in the warm Florida, Zoey is the captain of the school swim team, and besides having a mother who attempted suicide and an asshole as a father, she will also have to deal with amnesia after being in a wreck. She can't remember the Friday night when the wreck happened, only the moment when Doug helped her to get out of the car. Then, who would she believe? She decided not to tell anybody about her amnesia and to find out for herself what had happened that night, why Doug was acting like something special existed between them two, when actually she thought she was in a relationship with the football team player Brandon because they had slept together a few days before. All her questions are answered as long as she approaches Doug after the wreck, they start talking to each other more than ever, and even hang out to dinner once. The development of their story is pretty simply but very meaningful while Brandon does not really give a shit about Zoey, like Doug himself once says to her. It just annoyed me how long she took to realize Doug had been in love with her since forever, to realized he had been honest to her. And it amazed me their intense relationship, their meaninful talks, even though Zoey sucked at times. And again I have a crush on a Jennifer Echols' character, because she definitely knows who to describe a guy and makes him perfect for your eyes: then I fell for Doug, too, just like I did for John After from Going Too Far. Forget You explores some topics from an angle that I hadn't seen before in an Young Adult novel but that were super-well developed by Jennifer, such as: teenagers relationships in school sports teams (I'm especially talking about the swim and the football team, of course), the amnesia thing and teenagers exploring their bodies. It was sincerely interesting to have this point of view from a sportist, especially when she was around them team, the swim team. I think there should be more stories involving this topic, if I can call it that. Swimming, heat, and beaches fit wonderfully well in Forget You, though I admit I was expecting for a scene of Zoey and Doug enjoying the swimming pool together, but it was such a shame he can't be in the pool, right? Hahaha. I wish there were, I would have loved it. Well, yes, teenagers in this novel really do explore their bodies. They do. And I'm happy that an incredible writer like Jennifer Echols boldly, finally decided to bring this up, since this is an important and actual topic that has to be well discussed, especially between young adults and teenagers. Overall, Forget You is an amazing novel that you won't want to stop reading once you've started. Since Going Too Far, I was expecting for this, I didn't get disappointed, and I can finally, honestly say that Jennifer Echols is now one of my YA Heros, who I'll be supporting forever. And I can't wait for her 2011 romantic drama! Going Too Far and Forget You are must-read novels, and I highly recommend them both.",Raila Soares de Assis
9781439178232,"I know that the author is very well versed in the Young Adult Lit circles and has published incredible works. This is my first book by her. She is an excellent writer and definitely speaks to her audience. She wrote an amazing character by introducing us to Doug. I didn't like anybody else in the book. Truth be known, I think I would probably rename this book, ""How to Lose Your Virginity at 17."" Zoey seemed intent on doing exactly that. The secondary theme of Zoey trying to control her surroundings due to her lack of life control was excellent. I really wish there was more on this compulsion. I know I am part of the ""parent crowd"" but as a high school counselor, I pride myself on knowing a little more about the teenage culture. There were parts of the story where Zoey seems to jump from thought to conclusion without letting me into the process. I really didn't understand how Brandon continued to be her ""boyfriend"" when he didn't show up. I thought Zoey was really rather stupid. I didn't love the book and I wouldn't recommend it to any teenagers I know. On the other hand, I thought the writing style was strong and I would probably read another title by the author before deciding whether or not I like her books. This one just didn't draw me in. 3 stars",Nancy
9781439178232,"Forget You is the sort of book that I set aside for my nieces because it's much more than the usual YA romance novel. The characters might seem typical, but Jennifer Echols gives them complexity, depth and humor. We meet: * Zoey - captain of the swim team, wealthy (sometimes described as a ""spoiled brat""), popular, and high school senior. Her parents are separating and she's chosen to live with her mother, but her mother's had a nervous breakdown and Zoey's trying hard to prevent this from becoming news in their small town; * Keke and Lila - twins and on the varsity swim team. They're Zoey's closest friends and they sometimes drive her nuts. They think alike, act alike but try hard to differentiate themselves from each other. They're flaky, kind, and funny high school seniors; * Brandon - blond, wealthy, popular, captain of the football team, and high school senior. He's a major flirt and seems to flit from one relationship to another. He's one of Zoey's best friends and she's a constant confidant for his romantic escapades; and * Doug - the one person on the swim team that Zoey doesn't get along with. There's some history and some antagonism. We don't know exactly what happened, but Zoey comes down hard on Doug. He has a juvie record and though the record is sealed, Zoey points out his past to keep him from getting summer jobs, etc. With his juvie record, Zoey's persistence, and high school being what it is, Doug hasn't ever had a girl friend even though he's one of the best looking and athletic high school seniors. Forget You is about how things are never quite what they seem from the outside. It's about misunderstandings and prejudices, loyalty and friendship. It reminds us of what life is like as a teenager -- when parents have so much power over your life and your identity and how we each learn to break free. Carefully crafted, fun, and sympathetic, Forget You is a story of love and friendship. If you're looking for a YA romance for the summer -- whether for yourself or a friend, I highly recommend Forget You. I loved it!

9781439178232,"This was my first Jennifer Echols read and I realize I must have been living under a rock. Forget You was so much fun to read and with such an interesting plot concept I was entertained the whole way through. When Zoey's memory won't come back after a terrible car accident and she's left with only questions, Echols took readers on the journey of discovery with Zoey. I instantly felt sympathetic towards her crisis and situation and couldn't stop turning the pages. I shared her frustration and just had to know what really happened. As much as I liked Zoey, there were times where I just wanted to shake her because as I was piecing together some of the facts I couldn't believe she wasn't seeing what I was seeing. Echols gave us a love triangle to rival some of the best and I definitely had my favorite front runner. Zoey struggled with more than just a lost memory. She was faced with feelings for more than one guy and didn't have all the facts to help her out either. I was chomping at the bit to find out what really happened to Zoey before the accident, and to find out what would happen between Zoey and Brandon and between Zoey and Doug. Her plate was definitely full throughout the novel with her dysfunctional family problems, her oh so oblivious friends, her distant boyfriend, her brooding savior and of course her blank in way too many places memory. Zoey was in trouble and readers will be rooting for her from beginning to end and even after the last page is read. After becoming such a quick fan of Echols' writing and personality I can't wait to read more of her work to see what else she's going to be churning out next.",Katelyn
9781439178232,"Written in first person narrative, the reader is thrown directly into Zoey's life. I have to admit I didn't really like Zoey at the start of the story. I found her quite shallow, as if she thought of herself above the rules that apply to everyone else. She is quick to believe gossip and rumours which makes her completely paranoid when she is in the position of having something to hide. It was only as the story progressed and Zoey looks back at events in her life that I could appreciate the barrier/facade she has created for herself. Her mother has instilled in her the notion that people judge you solely on outward appearance and if you project the right appearance then problems disappear into the background. We all know this doesn't work and Zoeys mom's nervous breakdown just emphasised the point that you cant hide away from problems as they will just fester and escalate. I found myself really caring for Zoey, although she had lost her memory it was as if her eyes had been opened to the whole ugly truth for the first time. It really brought out some strong emotions in me as I was reading it. It is always a shock for a child to see their parents as just people with faults the same as everyone else rather than the idolised image of mom and dad. Being from a divorced family myself, I think it is a dream of every child of divorced parents that they get back together, even if they know deep down the reality of that particular scenario would be worse than the divorce itself. Some of Zoeys actions were questionable before the memory loss but nevertheless understandable. You really feel as if she was trying to distance herself from the traumatic events in her life by giving herself another point of focus. Why she picked Brandon for this is still beyond me, was she really naive enough to think that she could change him. The chemistry between Zoey and Doug was HOT, HOT, HOT. I completely loved everything about him. The parallels between Zoeys father and Doug's were ingenious, both were bullies, the difference being that at least Zoey had her Mum to turn to. I could completely relate, my father is a bully who likes to belittle people. I really felt as if it was a karma sort of thing between Zoey and Doug; they were meant for each other but life had got in the way only to give them a second chance years later. For me, by Zoey losing her memory she was able to find herself. I loved this book and I highly, highly recommend it. It was a wonderfully quirky road to self discovery and first love. AWESOME!!!!!!",Emma Davies
9780312360283,"Having defeated her arch-nemesis in the previous book, MARKED, Zoey should be on top of the world. But she's got the nagging feeling in the back of her mind that something's drastically wrong. At first, she thinks it could be all the stress she's under from her first ritual she's planning, or maybe the various boys in her life. She admits she's worried about the boys from her old school who have turned up missing. Then Zoey witnesses a conversation between Aphrodite and Neferet that leaves her breathless. Now Zoey's scared. Zoey needs her friends more than ever, but she's not too sure whom she can trust. The mother-daughter team of P.C. and Kristin Cast creates another suspenseful tale with a down-to-earth character blessed with magical powers.

9780763665661,"Incredible! I've read a couple of times magical-realism but wasn't expecting to find it in a Young Adult book. I really didn't know what to expect from Ava, a sixteen-year old girl born with wings, sometimes mistaken for an angel. The book starts with Ava's grandmother, the story about her parents and brothers, and how everything in the end is connected to Ava. Their family story and writing reminded me of One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, definitely a plus for me. I was hooked since the beginning, Ava's grandmother and mother both had a difficult life as consequence to foolish love. But Ava was a great girl, not only for having wings, but for her way to see life. Her family have been always the 'weird', but she's ready to face the world, very naive and not expecting her life to be so tragic. Love. Ah. It's about love, but I wouldn't call it a romance book. It's realistic love, not happily ever after love, and more than narrating a romance, it's about how some relationships turn out being very sad and affect the lives of everyone around. It may not be a book for everyone, it's not superficial or trivial, but I absolutely loved it! (although it broke my heart a couple of times). It only took me a few hours to read it, but who needs sleep right?. I definitely recommend it! Excellent addition to the YA literature.",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9780385736824,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Books4reviews.) Mary lives in a small village surrounded by a fence. On the other side of the fence are the 'unconsecrated'- the walking dead who crave human flesh and will stop at nothing to get it. Mary has lived in the village all her life, and the only things she knows of the world outside are stories that her mother has told her, of oceans of water, and buildings so tall that they touch the sky. Mary has only two dreams for the future; the first is that she marries Travis - a boy in the village that she secretly has feelings for, and the second that she see the ocean. Neither of these look like they will ever come true though, after Mary's mother is bitten and becomes one of the unconsecrated. Turned out by her brother and forced to join the 'sisterhood' in the cathedral, it seems that Mary will be a slave for the rest of her life, until one day the alarm sounds, the fences have been breached by the unconsecrated, and Mary and a few of her closest friends are the only survivors. What else is out there though? Were her mother's stories true? Is there an ocean out there and buildings that touch the sky? Or are Mary and her friends really the only surviving humans on the planet? I really enjoyed this book. It was creepy in places, but so honest and raw in others. I loved Mary, (although Mary doesn't really sound like the sort of name for a girl like her!). I loved her unending faith that there was something more out there, and that she was meant to see the ocean. I loved how she continually pushed, and tried to make her dreams come true, even in the face of oppression and even death. At times she made some silly decisions, but don't we all, and in the circumstances she managed unbelievably well. As for the other characters, I have mixed feelings about quite a few of them. Firstly - Jed, Mary's brother. Jed made me so mad! I really couldn't believe that with both their parents dead he could be so selfish and heartless as to cast Mary out of their parent's home, and tell her that she must go and join the sisterhood because nobody else wanted her. How awful is that? No matter how much he was grieving, Mary didn't deserve that, and I found him to be quite selfish and unfair. Travis( the boy that Mary had feelings for), was engaged to her best friend. While it was a little unclear as to whether he knew how she felt about him when this arrangement was made, it seemed unfair the way he continued to string her along, right up until their intended marriage day (Travis to Cass, and Harry to Mary), all the time telling her that he would change his mind and 'come for her' when in reality it seemed that he would do no such thing. I liked Travis in some ways, but he really needed to make a choice and stick with it, no matter what that choice was. Harry (Travis' brother, and the boy who eventually 'spoke' for Mary) was a character that we didn't really get to know all that well. He had feelings for Mary, although the feelings were not returned, and though he did eventually speak up and say that he would like to marry her, I couldn't help but puzzle over his motivations, especially when he knew how Mary felt about Travis. Cass - Mary's best friend; was another puzzling character. Whilst engaged to Travis, she was secretly in love with Harry! The strangest thing about this situation was though, that when Mary suggested that they just swap husbands-to-be, Cass says NO, and tells Mary that she will marry Harry or else, because she doesn't want Mary to break Harry's heart! Bizarre I tell you. I liked the storyline in this book, it was well paced, and the twists and turns were not easy to guess at all. Some of the events in this book were heart breaking, and I'm not sure I'll ever forget this story. I'm not really sure what can possibly happen in the second two books in this series, but I have to say that I'm excited to find out! Overall; a zombie-filled dystopian that's well worth a read. 9 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780385736824,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) So some of you may know that the first time I attempted to read this--about a year ago--that I didn't finish it. I couldn't get into it. I guess I just wasn't in the mood for it then. I told myself I'd try again because it had been on my TBR list for a while and I had heard a lot of great--though some were mixed--reviews about it. It was a very popular book back in 2009. It really was for a while, actually, but then just fell off the radar. Hopefully my review will bring it back up! I borrowed this eBook from the library and it did take me a little bit to get back into this story, but I kept pushing. It was kind of annoying, but at the same time you wanted to keep reading. The writing flows well and keeps you reading. It took me a bit to get into the fact that a lot of this book is mostly descriptions and the character kind of just telling you her story. There isn't much dialogue for a while until maybe halfway through the book where it picks up. But after a while I honestly did get used to it. The zombies in this book are scary. They are also called ""The Unconsecrated"" instead of zombies. They are terrifying, just like a good zombie is supposed to be. The people in this book has grown up with zombies all around them. It's their everyday life to go about their day with zombies all around them, just over the fence line. There are ""guardians"" standing watch near the gates, ready to signal the horn when there is a breach and everyone has to run to the nearest platform to get high up into the trees to safety. This is way into the future, after ""The Return"" where the disease has wiped off most of the planet and there are villages. There are also seasons where teen women are supposed to be ""called"" on and the next season they are to be married. You have very little options if you aren't called for, which the main character, Mary, isn't in the beginning and she has to go stay with ""The Sisterhood"". The Sisterhood is basically a church full of nuns that runs the whole village. Everyone thinks that The Sisterhood knows everything and that everyone should abide by their rules. I liked Mary. I loved that she was a dreamer, she knew deep down that there was something more out there and she was determined to get it. But that was also something I hated about her. She let her dreaming go so far to make her selfish. She wished so much for the guy she loved to love her back and to be with him, and she wished for so many other things, and when she finally did get them they weren't enough for her! She jeopardized everything that she had hoped for for something that may or may not be real. That bugged me to no end and completely broke my heart. I liked most of the other characters as well, though most of them had something about them that really did annoy me. I didn't like her brother Jed at first, I wanted to scream at him, and then Cass as well. I really liked Cass in the beginning, but toward the end when she started changing I really didn't . Though I couldn't blame her for wanting to go back to the safety of things she had always known. I really liked Travis. He was my favorite character. And Harry was okay, though I like him better with Cass. =D Overall, this was a great story. It completely destroyed my heart, but it was great and I can't wait to read the next book. If you love bad zombies and want a serious and suspenseful book to read, read this! The suspense definitely makes your heart race. This is not a zombie book to miss!",Amanda
9780385736824,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2012/06/20/review-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-by-carrie-ryan/ Dark and haunting, The Forest of Hands and Teeth was an emotional rollercoaster. At times, fear consumed me, and at other moments, I was overwhelmed with sorrow. But I was certain about one thing: The Forest of Hands and Teeth is an unforgettable novel, one that may catch up to you in your dreams ... or your nightmares. When I first cracked open this novel, I was struck by how similar the world of the Forest of Hands and Teeth was to the world of Ann Aguirre's Enclave. However, before you begin pointing fingers at Carrie Ryan, note that her novel was published in 2009, whereas Enclave was published in 2011. In addition, I did find differences in the two novels; for example, the zombies in the Forest were dubbed ""the Unconsecrated"" and were created by ""Infecting"" a human with a single bite, whereas those in Enclave were called Freaks and had no known origin. The societies in both books were also incredibly different; the Forest included the Sisterhood and the Guardians, unlike Enclave's society of Breeders, Builders, and Hunters. The world of the Forest can be described with one word-frightening. Imagine a village enclosed within a fence, and beyond that there is only the Forest. A Forest of zombies craving to feed on human flesh. The life that the villagers lead in the society is purely to survive. Love is second to commitment in marriages, and the Guardians serve to protect while the Sisters keep secrets from the villagers. Add in those insane zombies trying to claw their way into the village (oh, yeah, and if they manage to bite you, you'll die and turn into a zombie), and you've got yourself a dark postapocalyptic novel. In other words, I loved this account of the zombie apocalypse. It's nice to get a haunting novel every so often. While I may have loved the world Carrie Ryan created, I was not so much a fan of the characters. Though realistic (and I love realistic characters), the main character, Mary, was incredibly selfish. I loved that she was curious, always wondering about a world beyond her secluded village, but so much that that idea consumed her? She paid no attention to her best friend, her older brother, the two boys who loved her, and her own mother. And by the time she realized how much they meant to her, she had lost them all. I was disgusted with Mary, true, but I absolutely loved the boy she fell in love with. He understood her ever so well, and he always wished for her happiness. But I think I really fell in love with him when (spoiler!) Mary had to kill him. Because who doesn't long for happy endings? The Forest of Hands and Teeth enraptured me from its first word; Carrie Ryan's dark style of writing created a bleak world caught in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. I guarantee that you will not be able to set down this haunting novel.",Linda
9780385736824,"Mary lives in a village surrounded by the Forest of Hands and Teeth. The Unconsecrated fill the forest, moaning, trying to get into the village, to devour and make more of their own by a single bite, which will spread the infection. They don't give up. They want to feed. The Sisterhood holds the secrets of the village, from before the Return. No one knows the truth, except them. The Guardians protect the village, and make sure the fence holds back the Unconsecrated. The fence is the only barrier between the village and the Forest. But then, once Mary is forced into the Sisterhood, she learns things that she wishes she hadn't. There is the one section of the fence, which is forbidden; but, it leads somewhere... Mary knows it. But where does it lead? Mary must choose between her village and what may or may not exist beyond that one gate. I really enjoyed this book. I was hooked as soon as I started. Mary was a great character. She was strong, and always wanted more than what she had. She kind of reminded me of myself (only a little, though!). The only thing I didn't like in the story was the ending, only because I wanted to know more! It left me hanging a little, so I don't really know what will happen to Mary.

9780060012236,"In the conservative, oppressive town of Goodkind, Russel Middlebrook faces his biggest fear-publicly coming out-as he slowly discovers there are others at his own school, stubbornly questioning and reconciling with their sexualities, just like he is. In this town and in this decade, gay-straight alliances are unheard of-scorned, even-but upon kindling a brotherhood with the diverse group of people who are so different from him, and yet so similar, he learns that sometimes being yourself, no matter how hard, is more important than any reputation, any sort of acceptance, and any lie he'd be living otherwise. I was so impressed by this children's LGBT novel both because of the controversial topic it daringly confronts, and by the strength and grace with which it is written. Russel's realistic first-person narrative-one of the pioneering gay narrations in YA fiction-is a pleasure to read and captures the horrors and injustices of the high school social scene penetratingly, but in an appropriate, parent-approved fashion. I loved him as a character as well; he's so awkward, nice, and hilarious in an adorable teenage boy way. We need more gay narrators for YA! I also adore Russel's best friends, Min and Gunnar, because they aren't portrayed as the typical ""he's been my BFFL and always has my back no matter what"" crap. They're so flawed-so flavored-and that makes them so, so real. This book is touching, frightening, and compelling in all the right paces. It accurately conveys the fear of learning to cross and even break the invisible, vicious barriers within the high school social ladder, but not explicitly; it leaves just enough to the imagination, which is why I wholeheartedly recommend it to the younger crowd, too. The unexpected alliance Russel finds within Goodkind High School, the belonging and the assurance, highlights the importance of companionship and honesty of which I think all teenagers still need to be reminded. Even though Geography Club was written over ten years ago, the relationships Hartinger portrays stand the test of time in a poignant, universal story that readers of any age and any sexual orientation will love. In Geography Club, a handful of brave, passionate students stumble upon a connection in which they each can be completely honest with each other, as well as with themselves, for the first time in their young lives. This exchange of feelings and struggles that would otherwise be repressed is both gritty and soulful, and constitutes a brilliant coming-of-age novel. Pros: Interesting, suspenseful storyline // Cutting humor-I laughed out loud so many times! // Realistic, but still lovable characters // Russel's voice is so accurate // Tackles a sensitive issue fluidly and in a way that will encourage young readers Cons: Not enough rising action... wish there'd been more drama before the final climax Love: We bought tickets for the stupid romantic comedy rated PG-13, but once we were inside the multiplex, Kimberly said she wanted to see the stupid erotic thriller rated R instead. As for me, I didn't want to see either the romantic comedy or the erotic thriller. I wanted to see the animated Disney musical, which I guess just proved that I really was the gay boy that I'd been thinking all along that I was. -LOL this is why I love Russel! Verdict: Brent Hartinger's inspiring and dazzling debut isn't just a novel about gay adolescents; it touches upon important global teen matters of friendship, identity, and the courage to speak out, as well. I loved everything about it-the characters, the voice, the absorbing plot-and think it's one of those books that all young adult (14-16) and maybe the more-mature middle grade (11-14) readers ought to try.

After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room. He's never had an actual experience with another guy, though, so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he'll outgrow--or maybe not. While surfing the Internet one night, he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities, where you can talk to other people who are also gay. And amazingly enough, there's a boy he meets with the name GayTeen-- who not only lives in his town, but also attends his high school. Another gay boy, in his very own school? There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school. As Kevin and Russel get to know one another, outside of school and hidden away from prying eyes, they realize that there's no way for them to be together inside school walls. The same is true for Russel's friends Min and Terese, who although they claim to just be really close friends, are actually in love. So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club. After all, no one else is going to want to join such a boring club--especially if they knew it was just a front for a gay/ lesbian school group. As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life. And that sometimes, no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open, you're just not ready.

9780312367466,"It's been a really long time since I've read a YA book with such a refreshing premise-no vampires, complicated love triangles, or anything remotely Hunger Games-esque here! Now, Elsewhere was published way before the current of ""trendy"" YA fiction began to flow, which stresses its originality, and its purpose on bookshelves today. I love the take on reincarnation that's detailed-it's fascinating, imaginative, and immersed me completely from page one! Zevin is also highly accomplished at creating relatable, completely memorable characters. The limited third-person point of view makes Liz rather distant, but she's still easy to appreciate. She's as neurotic and elaborate as any adolescent is: impressively mature at times, but frustratingly childish at others. I feel she's a bit na?????????????????????-ve for a nearly-sixteen-year-old; don't get me wrong: her characterization is amazing, but her superficial portrayal is a little contradicting at times. As a teenage girl, though, she is perfectly accurate. Zevin couldn't have depicted the conflicting feelings and angsts of the modern teenager any better. Elsewhere is a feel-good novel that keeps you tense and uneasy while reading, but leaves you both breathless and sighing in relief by the turn of the last page. It offers brilliant perspective on experiencing things to the fullest and never underestimating those around you who love you. Through Liz's journey in Elsewhere, spending her life in reverse, I learned that life isn't measured in hours and minutes; it's the quality that matters, not the length. And we, as people, grow with those experiences, not with age. Young adults will devour this book, and better yet, parents will approve of it because of its tasteful, positive portrayal of life's decisions and values. Zevin's style is evocative, dreamy, and almost transcendent-I'm definitely eager to try some of her other books now. With a dash of charming romance, wry humor, and life-loving sentiments, Elsewhere engages readers into an afterlife where people falsely are under the impression that they know what will be JUST because they know the amount of time they have left to ""live."" But like I mentioned, it's experiences that matter, not time; this secret, Liz and readers discover, in the most delightful and adventurous of ways. In the town of Elsewhere, Liz has the chance to live again, to live as she never got to on Earth. To fall in love. To get a job. To know the part of her family she has never known. And she's going to have to make the most of it because even though it may not be clear all the time, good things happen everyday, even when bad things happen first. Pros: Well-explored characters // Perfect ending // I was cheering at every one of Zevin's plot choices // Lyrical // Stylistically flawless // Plot is incredibly smart, entertaining, and touching // Very easy // Flows smoothly // Unpredictable // Not a high thriller, but its twists and turns are equally unnerving // Romance is perfectly placed // Deep in message of youth, forgiveness, and the meaning of life // Creative premise // Fresh ideas // Sweet, memorable analogies // Owen ???????????????C/??????????C/???????????C/???????????????Y=_???????????????C/??????????C/???????????C/???????????????Y= // Curtis ???????????????C/??????????C/???????????C/???????????????Y=_???????????????C/??????????C/???????????C/???????????????Y= Cons: Not particularly suspenseful... I was glued to the pages, but not exactly dying to know what happened next // Liz is frustrating at times, but I guess it's all part of her character! Love: ""The summer air is thick with perfume from Betty's flowers. The scent, Liz thinks, is sweet and melancholy. A bit like dying, a bit like falling in love."" Verdict: Elsewhere is a complex, probing novel wrapped up in a minimalistic, lyrical package of prose. In the vein of The Five People You Meet in Heaven, this book is haunting, affecting, and deeply resonant, and is sure to be a hit among middle-grade and teenage readers (ages 11-16), but even better, among adults as well; the universality makes it all the more impressive. Hilarious in some parts and alarming in others, Gabrielle Zevin's surprisingly and pleasantly touching otherworldly story will make you fall in love-with your friends and family, with your life, and with yourself-and satisfy you completely. 9 out of 10 hearts (5 stars): Loved it! This book has a spot on my favorites shelf. Source: Purchased.",Karielle
9780312367466,"Stories about the Afterlife have always appealed to me. There are thousands upon thousands of interpretations out there about what, exactly, happens to a person after they die. ELSEWHERE is a new spin on an old topic, but it manages to bring emotion, realism, and entertainment to something that is, in most circumstances, a very depressing situation. To me, ELSEWHERE is a combination of Mitch Albom's THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN and Alice Sebold's THE LOVELY BONES, two other wonderful books dealing with death and the Afterlife. ELSEWHERE goes beyond those two books, however, taking readers on a journey into a land so much like Earth, and yet so very, very different. Fifteen-year old Elizabeth ""Liz"" ""Lizzie"" Marie Hall has found herself in ELSEWHERE after dying in a bicycle-meets-taxi accident. After taking a long ride on the SS Nile, Liz has finally realized that she's not in a dream after all, but really, truly dead. When she arrives on Elsewhere, she meets her maternal grandmother, Betty, for the very first time. A woman who died at fifty from breast cancer, Betty is now a woman in her thirties--one of the first surprises Liz is in for is the fact that, on Elsewhere, lives are lived backward from the age of a person's death. Needless to say, this thought depresses Liz. She'll never be sixteen, never have a Massachusetts driver's license, never go to the prom or graduate from high school or go to college or get married. The only thing she has to look forward to is growing younger, until she returns to being an infant and is sent back to Earth to be born again. Liz spends her first month on Elsewhere spending all of her time--and her grandmother's eternims, the currency used there--to watch her family, friends, and classmates back on Earth. She's soon a regular at the OD's, or Observation Decks, watching life on Earth pass her by. She's upset that her best friend, Zooey, didn't attend her funeral. Her parents are inconsolable, her younger brother, Alvy, tells jokes to get through the day, and her dog, Lucy, refuses to accept that Liz isn't coming back. It takes awhile, but Liz finally realizes that spending hours upon hours at the OD's is not helping her adjust to life on Elsewhere. She finds a new friend in Owen, one of the detectives in charge of keeping the inhabitants of Elsewhere away from the Well, where contact with people on Earth is possible, but illegal. She once again befriends Thandi, a young girl killed on Earth by a stray bullet, who was her bunkmate on the SS Nile. She gets closer to grandmother Betty, finally takes a job in the Division of Domestic Animals helping recently departed pets find new owners, and seems to be finding a place on Elsewhere. I really loved this story. One of the most delightful things in ELSEWHERE is the animals, especially the dogs. Liz, a natural at the language of Canine, is able to interpret for her four-legged friends, and finally understand everything they have to say. I can't truly imagine aging backwards, but Gabrielle Zevin has managed to make a truly believable story that is realistic, entertaining, and emotional, all at the same time. This is definitely a recommended read, and in all honesty, I would love to visit the land of Elsewhere again in the future. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780451222381,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm, as a part of my 'Old Reviews' feature. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Okay, first of all, I did the same as I did with The Dead Girls' Dance, and immediately picked up Midnight Alley as soon as I finished. I just finished reading Lord of Misrule and so I can't really remember what happened in what book, mostly. Everything is starting to run together. I love how she picks up nearly RIGHT after the last book ends. She's done this throughout the series and I love it. Nothing is left out. Nothing to make you wonder what happened in between the ending of one book and the beginning of the next. And the characters are still growing and being utterly amazing. All the characters in Caine's vampire world, otherwise knows as Morganville, is all real to me. Sometimes to the point where I walk out of my house and wonder what crazy thing is going to happen in Morganville today, or where I nearly write Morganville down as my city, instead of my real city. Can you imagine the looks I would get for that? ;) In this installment Claire is paying for the choices she made in the last book and you get to know Amelie a bit more. Which is awesome, but doesn't mean that I don't have my evil stare ready for her at times. And Mrynin, I honestly do not know what to say about him. He's such a nut, but he is quite hilarious at times. He's such a whacko. But I do like him, though I do have my moments where I want to whack him with something and put him in a straitjacket. We also continue to learn more about Morganville and it's history, along with the vampires history. Which is very fascinating and sends me to Google in search for more history on Morganville, but then I have to remember the fact that the lovely Rachel Caine created it. Midnight Alley ends with yet another cliff hanger, and also a new visitor in town! Caine really knows how to end with a cliff hanger to keep you reading, which I both admire and find really annoying. But that's only because on one side it's genius, and on the other it becomes a pain in the butt when you can't get to the next installment fast enough. Overall I really loved this installment. As I did the others and don't think I'll ever not like one of these amazing books. If you haven't read any books in this series yet, you REALLY need to put it on your wish list and 'TBR' list.",Amanda

9780765323118,"LITTLE BROTHER presents a pretty scary picture of the way things could be if terrorist threats continue, and politicians keep funding the Department of Homeland Security with no thought as to how this might victimize the average innocent American. There is already an incredible amount of technology devoted to ""spying"" on the citizens of our country, and we normally don't give it a second thought. This book will make you think - and not just a little bit. Marcus is a seventeen-year-old tech wizard. Granted, he often uses his skills for less than ethical reasons, but he doesn't hurt anyone. When a terrorist attack destroys the Bay Bridge near his home in San Francisco, he and several friends are captured by police (DHS) as they are attempting to help a fallen companion. They become the victims of frightening interrogation and torture. When Marcus finally gains his freedom, he vows to take back America from the out-of-control Department of Homeland Security. Using his vast techie skills, he creates an alternate Internet called Xnet, which utilizes the old XBox game system. Marcus becomes known as M1k3y and develops a huge group of supporters. Together, they attempt to undermine the government agencies determined to destroy the true meaning and protection of the United States Constitution. Cory Doctorow has created a modern-day 1984. Set in the not-too-distant future, this book attempts to show what could happen if we sit back and allow the government to whittle away at our rights to ""protect"" us from terrorism. It gives a whole new meaning to the idea of terrorism and fear within our own government. LITTLE BROTHER is full of adventure and intrigue. A lot of the suspense comes from all the technical tricks Marcus brings to the story. Some of the details might prove too much for a struggling reader, but any tech/geek teens will not be able to read it fast enough.",TeensReadToo

Not a good thing when you have a phobia of snakes and there is a detailed description of a pet boa constrictor. Intriguing story with a very powerful finale (I cant go into detail without spoiling the story. I particularly adored the quotes about faeries and folklore above the start of the chapters.

9781408827192,"(Source: I received a copy of this book as a gift.) In an oxygen starved world, where people live in a pod pumped full of artificial oxygen, 16-year-old Alina is a member of the resistance, and wants to help grow new trees, and take the people's freedom back from the hands of the government. 16-year-old Quinn is a Premium, and gets as much oxygen as he wants, he never considered that the government, and even his father might be lying to him about the way they ended up in the situation they are in with regards to oxygen. 16-year-old Bea is an auxiliary, and her parents work constantly just to pay for the oxygen tax to keep them alive. Bea's mother wants nothing more than for Bea to marry Quinn so that she doesn't have to worry about oxygen any more. What is really going on though? Are the government lying and why? Is the resistance the answer? And can people survive outside of the pod? I really wanted to love this book, but the plot holes just became ridiculous. Alina, Quinn, and Bea were all okay characters, but I found the shifting perspectives a little annoying, and having finished the book I can't say that I really grew to love any of them. The beginning of this book was pretty good, but as it went on I just had more and more questions, and so many things were just silly. I initially thought that the ideas in this book were good - although I couldn't quite believe that anyone would be stupid enough to remove ALL the trees from the Earth. I mean really? We have known for long enough that we need trees for oxygen that this future should not be possible, which makes the overall storyline here a little questionable. Anyway, we then learn about life in the dome or ??????C/?C/??!~pod', and how people are taxed for the amount of oxygen they use. All very well and good, but what is to stop people from just being out of the house? The climate in the pod was controlled, why wouldn't people just stay out of the house all day to decrease their oxygen consumption? At several points it is mentioned that people ??????C/?C/??!~train' in alleys, and even have sex in alleys where the oxygen consumption is not an issue, so why isn't everybody out there enjoying the free air? And if it is known that people do this in the alleys, why are the alleys not policed more? As the book moved on we also got more silliness. How stupid do you have to be to burn your dead when there is an oxygen shortage? How stupid do you have to be to steal an enemy vehicle, and drive it straight to the door of the resistance? Is it not obvious that the army will track said stolen vehicle and find the whole enclave? How silly is it to worry about the size of your manhood when you are trying to not get killed? How stupid do you have to be to walk through deep snow, and then claim to have been walking in the opposite direction when you bump into someone? Is it not obvious which way you have come by the tracks you left in the snow? And doesn't smoking around oxygen tanks run the risk of them exploding? Other than these annoying things, the story was alright, and there were things that I didn't see coming. I thought the idea of the world being oxygen-deprived to be an interesting one, and I hated how trapped by your need for oxygen you would feel in this sort of situation. I didn't really appreciate the love triangle though, and a lot of the decisions made seemed a little short-sighted and na????????????-ve, which was disappointing. I was also a little disappointed by the ending. So much was left unresolved, and this is not the kind of story where you can choose whether to read the second book or not, this ended with a bit of a cliff-hanger ??????C/?C/??!~everybody is still in danger' sort of situation. Overall; a great idea, but poorly executed. 6.75 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth

9781408827192,"Thursday, October 11, 2012{REVIEW and GIVEAWAY} BREATHE (BREATHE #1) by SARAH CROSSAN Series: Breathe #1 Publisher: Greenwillow Publication Date: Oct 2, 2012 Format: ARC Pages: 400 Source: Received from publisher for review. Inhale. Exhale. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe . . . The world is dead. The survivors live under the protection of Breathe, the corporation that found a way to manufacture oxygen-rich air. Alina has been stealing for a long time. She's a little jittery, but not terrified. All she knows is that she's never been caught before. If she's careful, it'll be easy. If she's careful. Quinn should be worried about Alina and a bit afraid for himself, too, but even though this is dangerous, it's also the most interesting thing to happen to him in ages. It isn't every day that the girl of your dreams asks you to rescue her. Bea wants to tell him that none of this is fair; they'd planned a trip together, the two of them, and she'd hoped he'd discover her out here, not another girl. And as they walk into the Outlands with two days' worth of oxygen in their tanks, everything they believe will be shattered. Will they be able to make it back? Will they want to? ""I will die because I knew there had to be a better way to live."" (ARC, pg. 197) Why I Chose to Read Breathe ~ I was approached by the publisher to help with a promotion. This also included an ARC for review. I thought the story sounded cool, kind of like Under the Never Sky, so decided to give Breathe a try. In a future destroyed by a need to sustain the world's growing population, air is not a right, it's a precious commodity. With too many people and not enough oxygen, in true form, a big corporation, Breathe, stepped in a provided what the people needed. But it comes with a price. If you're wealthy or a family of importance, your money can buy all the air you need, allowing you to perform such extravagant activities as running, playing, dancing. But if you are poor, and can only afford the bare minimum, you are policed so that you do not overuse your share of oxygen. You may not run fast, play instruments, or go wild and actually make out with your companion. Most citizens, believing their government and this corporation want the best for them. But there are those who believe that their leaders and Breathe are playing a game of control. Keep the people down. Make the people think they need you. When two teens from the Pod meet a member of the Resistance, they learn exactly what is going on, and will discover what it means to truly be free. For me, Breathe was very similar, in message, to The Lorax by Dr. Seuss. You have a world with no vegetation to produce oxygen, and a company that is profiting from the situation. What I love about dystopian stories like Breathe, is when the premise makes sense because the author has given a very clear and scientific reason. I get irritated with stories that rely on a weak or vague explanation as to how their specific situation came to be. In Breathe, we have a dire future that is realistic and could very well come to pass eventually. Breathe had three equally great leads. Alina is a member of the Resistance. She was tough, but a bit unlikeable in the beginning. She's a girl who has lost a lot and has become an emotionally distant, ruthless person. She doesn't want tag-alongs on her journey, but finds herself becoming close to and caring for Quinn and Bea. Quinn and Bea are out to have a short adventure outside the Pod. Though they both live there, their lives are dramatically different. Quinn is a Premium, lives an easy, happy life and takes the oxygen he uses for granted. Bea also lives in the Pod, but is an Auxillary. As an Auxillary, she is not considered Quinn's equivalent. Her family exists on the minimum oxygen required, lead slow, quiet lives and are regulated to the extreme. The revelations these three discover about themselves and the world they thought existed was heartbreaking and exhilarating. In addition to the three MCs, we have a straggler, Maude Blue. Maude was truly the surprise of Breathe. I didn't think it was possible, but she became a true gem in this story. Breathe captured me from the very first line. I was horrified at the inhumanity, indignant at the injustice, and my heart was alternately broken and flying at each turn. If you enjoy truly realistic and plausible dystopian with a sci-fi/post-apocalyptic edge, I encourage you to give Breathe a shot.",Andrea Thompson

9780142501559,"Sarah Dessen's THIS LULLABY is one of the best teen books I've ever read. It's the story of Remy, a girl who has no faith in love. Part of this is because her own father never even saw her, only wrote a now-famous song, called ""This Lullaby,"" about her before he died. It certainly doesn't help that her mother has been married four times, and, at the beginning of the novel, is about to have her fifth wedding. Remy says about her mother's marriages, ""She takes on husbands the way other people change their hair color: out of boredom, listlessness, or just feeling that this next one will fix everything, once and for all."" Remy likes to feel in control of things when she's got a boyfriend. She knows all about getting into relationships, the first romantic rush, and ending them before there's any emotional attachment. She's almost always the one to dump guys, not the other way around. She's got plenty of practice at it, too. One day, at the car dealership owned by her mother's next husband, she meets a guy named Dexter. He's very determined to get to know Remy, and, at first, she thinks he's ridiculous and ignores him. Dexter, however, is persistent. When the two finally get together, everyone is shocked that Remy's staying in the relationship. Dexter is so many things Remy could never put up with. He's messy and impulsive, but, most of all, he's a musician. Until Dexter came along, Remy had a ""no musician"" rule, and now she's broken it. Signs point to Remy ending this relationship and not looking back. Everyone thinks that's what will happen. Everyone except Dexter, who wants it to be more than a summer thing, who has faith in their relationship. How will it all end? This is an amazing young adult book by a brilliant author. Sarah Dessen, author of several other books including THAT SUMMER and SOMEONE LIKE YOU, does an awesome job of keeping the reader's attention throughout THIS LULLABY. She does it with her original story, told in Remy's unique voice. It doesn't hurt that Sarah Dessen is great at creating fresh, original, believable characters. Thoughtful and powerful, this book also has its moments that will make readers laugh, which is a nice change of pace in the story. Every aspect of this novel surpasses expectations. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9780425266748,"Another NA contemporary that tackles a sensitive yet important issue, EASY grabbed me from the beginning and refused to let me go even after I finished reading it. My favorite part of the book was the characters. Jacqueline is not a perfect heroine but it isn't difficult to like her. She may be blinded by her love for her boyfriend Kennedy to set aside her dreams and align her academic plans with his, but I think that kind of love is not misplaced. She's a good person, loyal to a fault and has her own identity. She has made bad decisions but she owned them and learned from them. Lucas is a total hottie. I almost always swoon whenever I read about him. I'd probably have a hard time choosing between him and Cam (of Wait For You). ^__^ Anyway, I really liked Lucas's character. He's mysterious, talented and smart. He protects and looks out for Jacqueline even from a distance, but not in a creepy, stalker-mode way. And there's more to him than meets the eye. All that angst and mystery come from somewhere and Lucas's story is one filled with pain and grief you wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone. The secondary characters are equally amazing. Erin is such a loyal friend. I love her wits and humor. Her concern for Jacqueline is also touching. Erin gives her strength and encouragement when she needs it the most. She stands up for what is right and is willing to give sacrifices for friends. Benjie is also a comic relief. What's with the gay characters in books nowadays? Do they really come with built-in humor in the package? He's really funny and adds color to the story. Kennedy, of course, is an important character. With all his flaws and jerkheadedness, he contributed a lot to Jacqueline's change. In some way, he paved the path for Jacqueline to meet Lucas. Another character worth mentioning is Katie, president of Erin's sorority. She's mentioned very little but she made such impact on me when she gave her - and the sorority's - support on Mindi. It was a beautiful moment amidst an ugly discussion: a woman standing up for another woman who has been wronged. I really liked that part. Girl power ftw! A major part of the book tackles the issue of rape. I understand it is a sensitive and ugly issue and one that needs to be addressed. I admire Mindi for standing up for herself, however difficult it is, and Jacqueline for finally breaking her silence. It is not an easy decision as both women faced humiliation and judgment from other people. But they made it through because they had the love and support of their friends and family. I believe it's a major factor on finding the courage to fight for yourself: when you know that you are not alone in your fight. I think what rape victims need is someone they trust that they can talk to. And then it goes from there. The path to justice is never easy nor pretty but if you have at least one person beside you, that counts a lot. The lines are funny and quirky at times and heartfelt and intense at others. The balance between the romance aspect and the underlying themes of social issues is very well-executed. The mystery and the background stories of the characters are also worth looking forward to. EASY is enjoyable and romantic, but also very real and honest. It does not shy away from the main issue, and even suggests a way to prevent it from happening. I really liked the self-defense classes that Erin and Jacqueline attended. Aside from the humor (courtesy of Erin's bloodlust for balls-kicking), those classes gave the women a way to protect themselves and prevent from becoming a victim. Reading EASY makes me want to learn self-defense, too. (Of course, it wouldn't hurt if the instructor is also as hot as Lucas. ^__^) My verdict: TOTALLY RECOMMENDED! Very good, very romantic and eye-opening, EASY goes straight to your heart and will make you wish for your own Lucas Maxfield (minus the tragic family history).",Julie Rimpula

9780425266748,"Favourite Quote: ""Love is not the absence of logic but logic examined and recalculated heated and curved to fit inside the contours of the heart"" I've heard a lot of hype about this book and since I've been really into New Adult recently I decided I just had to read it! And I really enjoyed it, 4/5 stars! Let's start with the characters, first there's Jacqueline who I really liked, she was independent, smart, down-to-earth and very easy to relate too. Then our other main character Lucas who I just loved, how could you not? He's a hero with flaws! Their relationship was sweet and I really enjoyed watching it develop slowly. But the only other character I loved was Erin, Jacqueline's best friend. The other side characters either werent memorable or just terrible people who I wouldn't have liked in real life. The plot wasn't unique I've read other books with a simliar plot like Wait For You by Jennifer L.Armentrout which I just loved, even more than easy, so check that out! Continuing with Easy's plot, I guessed all the plot twists and I wasn't surprised when anything happened but overall it was okay and dealt very well with the sentistive subject area! I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try out New Adult, looking for a great stand-alone or just wants to read a book that features a more hard-hitting topic!",brookexx
9780425266748,"See also my blog on http://deskynowsky.blogspot.com/ I have to rate this book somewhere between 2.5 to 3 stars. The story was (for me) very predictable. I have to say that most (all) of my predictions had come true. So, unfortunately there was not so many surprises at all (at least for me). I am not so sure what to write on my review tho (I am kinda in my reviewing-slump period). It wasn't a bad read, it was just an usual one. The characters, hmm...... say I didn't really like the girl at the beginning (and at the end, I'm just Okay with her). I mean she was just a very typical damsel in distress kind of girl that needed to be saved and voila! there was ur prince.. So as the story went, it was just becoming more predictable. Talk about the guy, I am not so sure how to describe him without giving the spoilers.. At first I thought he was just too perfect to be true, a caring bad-boy-emo-good-looking guy with nerd-economics-engineering-brain-quality (who I thought can only be found only at a custom-made market, U know I want one), but no one is perfect, there was always a dark background story to this kind of character, which I think would be more interesting if the story kinda told from his perspective, there'd be more emotional twists... but well yeah just my random thoughts.. and as for other characters, I don't have anything to say, I think they were just alright character companions. The redeeming quality of the book was and still is definitely the issue it raised. And for that only reason, I think this book is a good read for many young female readers. It gave a general understanding of a sexual crime towards women and showed on how people (esp. women) might be able to handle or prevent it. The issue itself is already a pretty heavy subject if it was explored deeper in the story, but the book was heavier on the romance-story side so it was light and easy to read and understand.",Deska Natalia
9780425266748,"My first thoughts on putting the book down: More please? Unfortunately, this is not a series, but it definitely would make me interested if there was a follow up with the characters. I don't think it is in the cards, but alas, I think this is just my way of expressing how much I liked the characters and how I was invested in their story. Jacqueline had my sympathy and my cheers from page one. She was a victim and watching her learn about herself and grow through her experiences touched me deeply. Sexual assault is something that hits way too close to home to me and also to probably many other readers. Even if not personally, through a friend or family member. We all think that it won't happen to us, and can all be surprised at the perpetrators at times. It can be people we know and possibly even love... I think that the message ultimately becomes, speak up, get help and stand together strong. It sounds simplistic, but that is really what people need to take away. It is woven beautifully through this story, and Tammara handles it with grace. Lucas is HOT. He is that bad boy and I want a piece of him, broken, secrets and all. The reasons he does everything is so important and even the moments where I want to doubt him, I still see it all coming together into a picture of a man, with scars, but with a lot of love and things to offer. As much as I like a brooding guy, he turns that into something new and even more awe inspiring. He contributes to others, to helping them while helping himself work through his issues. The secondary characters were also well crafted. Erin, Jacqueline's roomie, took me a second to warm up to her, but once I did, I loved every scene she was in. She was the right combo of supportive, encouraging, and fun. There was also Benji, who stole the scene in eco class. I loved what he brought to the story, whether a gay token or not. Then, you can't leave out the professor. It was neat how his story tied into ""Landon's"" and I was not expecting it. Then there is Kennedy. One minute I am thinking he is a butt, then I see a glimmer of the person I think Jacqueline fell for to start with, and then he goes on the rinse and repeat cycle and I want to Gibbs' clipboard to the back of the head again. So, obviously, I loved the characters. Tammara nailed them and I couldn't take my eyes from their story. This really was my kind of book--smoking chemistry, issues, a well done main character, and a love interest with protector instincts. Bottom line: Superb NA contemporary.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780425266748,"I just finished reading Easy and I have to tell you, guys, now I understand why the big fuss. It is good. It holds the perfect amount of drama, romance, hotness and misunderstandings to make the book irresistible. For starters the plot evolves around one of those things that sadly are still very taboo in our society: rape. I bet most of you flinched after reading the word. I know I did. Not just because it makes us, women, feel vulnerable but also because we know when its mentioned it comes with a lot of pain, rage and depression. That's why, after reading Easy, I felt the need to thank the author, Tammara Webber. I really hope she reads this because I've worked with girls that were raped and I know the suffering they went, and go, through. Ms. Webber did an amazing job portraying the different situations that could happen, not only to the victims but also showing how could the people around them react. And it felt real, all of it. The ones that supported the victim, the ones that tried to defend the rapist and the ones that justified the rapist' behavior. As amazing as it sounds the last two do happen more often that I want to admit. And I don't understand it. Rape is wrong, is hurtful and no one, girl or boy, young or adult, deserves to suffer it. But the author treated everything with elegance, from our main character Jaqueline who was about to be raped until a guy she didn't know saved her, to the romance that evolved from it. This knight in white armor has a name, Lucas. Despite his secrets, that are dark and very heart breaking, he is almost perfect. He doesn't only tries to protect Jaqueline but remembers her that what happened wasn't her fault and encourages her in the right moments. Like many bloggers out there I have to say that we all need a Lucas in our lives. He is the kind of guy that brightens a room with his presence just by being there. As for the supportive characters my favorite was Jaqueline's best friend, Erin. Very loyal, very strong, very protective; she didn't hesitate to stand by her friend no matter what. Then of course we have Kennedy, Jaqueline's ex boyfriend how, although he tries to emend his mistake of breaking up with her he does it very poorly. And the bad guy (very, very bad guy) Buck. He is the perfect prototype of the worst abuser: he could be your friend and then backstab you in a second. The romance was well developed too, it wasn't the kind of ""Oh, you saved me, I'm in love with you"" thing, far from it, Jaqueline tried to forget that night with all her strength but somehow Lucas just kept appearing wherever she was. And he usually looked or said the right thing in the right time. And let's not forget the making out. Because it happened, and I loved it. As I said, Ms. Webber did everything with elegance and these situations, after what happened to Jaqueline, are very delicate and Lucas was the perfect gentlemen. Overall, I can only say that I'm ready to read every book that Ms. Webber has write so far, I'm sure I just found a new author to love and treasure.",Alaiel Kreuz
9780857070432,"(Source: Purchased on kindle from Amazon.co.uk for PS2.49) Carlos is moving from Mexico to Colorado to live with his brother, and finish high school. He's got no time for a girlfriend, or any sort of complication to his life, and getting arrested for drug dealing is the last thing he wanted. Intent on not revealing the name of the kid who planted the drugs on him, Carlos ends up living with professor Westford and his family, whose daughter Kiara seems to be getting slowly under his skin. Carlos isn't boyfriend material though, he just wants a girl to screw around with, doesn't he? This is the second book in the 'Chemistry' series, but can be read as a stand-alone novel (I haven't read the first one.) I liked this story, but for me it took a long time for the romance to kick in. Carlos is a pretty rough male lead, he's obviously lived in some not-nice places, and although his mother has done her best, he's not had the best of starts in life. He was pretty stubborn about not revealing the name of the drug dealer who set him up, even though he wasn't actually anything to do with him, and this probably revealed quite a lot about the things he learned as a teen. Underneath it all, quite a way underneath it all, Carlos was a good person, but in the beginning he was pretty rude to Kiara and her family, and probably didn't deserve the chance they gave him. For me the romance took a long while to build up in this book. At the beginning Carlos was not very nice to Kiara at all, I totally got why she wanted to play a practical joke on him to pay him back for some of his comments. That being said, as they slowly got to know each other a little better, Carlos wasn't quite so mean, but I certainly didn't see why Kiara was falling for him either. Things didn't really heat up between the pair until really late in the story; around the last10-15% of the book in fact, which was a little disappointing, but when they eventually got together things weren't even smooth sailing then. Kiara was an okay character, but while she seemed to have problems with stuttering during stressful moments, she didn't seem to have the same problem when whispering dirty little teases in Carlos' ear, which personally would have made me a little nervous! The ending of the book concerned Carlos and the drug ring he had somehow gotten caught up in, and this was unfortunately the least interesting part of the story for me. I didn't really appreciate the epilogue much either. Overall; a YA contemporary romance, with quite a slow-to-love couple. 6.75 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780330397858,"This is an extraordinary book, which should be read by adults as well as children. It is not extraordinary because of the central plot, which after all is fairly straightforward. It is extraordinary for two other reasons. First, Westall has captured the wonderful normalising capacity of children. These children live alongside death and the threat of death. Theirs is a violent world. And, while they are clearly bruised in some ways, they do their best to take it in stride. They speak almost casually of the deaths of friends and community members, because to do otherwise - to confront the true gravity of events - would have been overwhelming. Second, this is an extraordinary book because each of the main (child) characters splendidly protrays one of the basic stereotypes of home-front Britain. Chas is a juvenile version of the ""dependable Tommy"", Cem is the cheerful working class Brit, Clogger the strong silent type, Nicky the stiff-upper-lip gentleman (or what passes for such in Garmouth), and tom-boying Audrey, who will ""only do kissing"" is the younger sister of the girl who goes off to do 'men's work' in the munition factories all day then to the dance halls at night. And yet, despite representing stereotypes, the characters are maintained well enough that you hardly ever notice (and certainly never regret). I also enjoyed the fact that Westall does not squib the ending. If this was an American book, it would have all turned out right in the end, with some sort of patriotic moral to the story. I won't spoil the ending for those who are yet to read the book ... but Westall does not take the easy way out. Highly recommended. And never mind the suggestion that the book contains a lot of violence. It does ... but less than 5 minutes on any first-person-shooter video game.",Anthony Marinac
9781423130215,"So much suffering, so much pain... a suicidal girl who failed to kill herself ends up wearing a neck brace and not being able to talk. One day, she comes across a website called Through The Light, a virtual gathering place for people who wants to end their lives because of various reasons. She signs up as a member, and she schedules herself to die 23 days later, on the day of determination. And so, she starts to plan her death. Morbid, I know, but it's sad too. Daelyn Rice has been bullied since kindergarten, and she's too afraid to confess the truth to anyone, her parents included. She's suffered from endless verbal and physical torments, and her inability to fight back makes her hates herself even more. It really angers me to see how some people can be so mean and cruel. They are monsters in disguise of humans who feed on others' fear and helplessness. Daelyn's mother, Kim is basically ignorant about her daughter's conditions, as she is always busy with her work. She always assumes that Daelyn is shy and timid, and never see how broken her daughter is after going to and returning from the hellhole which is school itself. She's blinded by her assumptions, and that nearly causes her daughter's life. If I were a mother, and someone were to bully or terrorize my child, I would report this incident to the school administration and demand an appropriate punishment for the bullies. Heck, I will also threaten the school that if they do not take action on this matter, I will lodge an official police report. Yes, I'm that badass. But as a mother, I will do anything to protect my child. Daelyn's only friend is Santana, a geeky boy who sits at the bench - which she assumes to be her bench after school everyday. Santana tries to engage her in a conversation, but she remains mute. Santana, in his desperation, eventually brings his pet rat Herve to see Daelyn, but she only freaks out at the sight of his rat. But as days pass, she realizes that Santana is not a bad person after all. Soon, they become non-friends - not exactly friends, but something which borders the term. Later, Daelyn discovers that Santana has a secret on his own, and she is shocked to learn how Santana can still live the way he does. Daelyn's encounter is pitiful, but I feel that she should be braver - looking for an easy way out through suicide is never the option as your tormentors will not feel a shred of guilt even if you die. It's your parents who will hurt, it's your family who will mourn your death, its your mother who will cry her heart out at losing a child who was once a part of herself. By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead is a harrowing and heartbreaking story. The title speaks for itself. However, I think there are times when we have to learn to face the truth with courage, no matter how hard and painful it may be.",Aik

He liked their energy, their insatiable craving for the gory details, no matter how gruesome or unsettling they might be.a?? This is a re-read for me and I decided this time round, I would review it! I love this book so much, and it is without a doubt 5/5 stars! I loved everything about this book so Ia??ll start with the plot! There were two main story arcs in this book, the romance and the murder mystery arc! Both of which I just loved and I felt they both entwined well! The romance is one of my favourites ever and I loved that it was quite gradual! As for the murder mystery, wow it was just awesome! Kimberly Derting knows how to write suspenseful, creepy scenes! There are short chapters from the serial killers P.O.V and those are just chilling and freaky! There are certain twists in this arc that I never expected and this just kept me on the edge throughout! Seriously this book has one of the creepiest and interesting plots Ia??ve ever read! As for the characters, I just loved both Violet and Jay! Violet was an everyday kind of girl and I instantly related to her, she was kind, sweet, funny and playful! Her unique talent would scare me senseless if I had it but she handles it with such grace and dignity, making me love her even more! Then therea??s Jay who would be the perfect boyfriend for me, he is sweet, funny, hot, smart a?? the list is actually endless!

9780061779831,"My rating: 4/5 stars *May contain some spoilers * Violet is in love with her best friend. And she can ""hear"" dead bodies. Isn't that intriguing or what? I've never heard a story exactly like this before, so I was beyond excited to read this. And I really wasn't disappointed. Kimberly Derting managed to tell a sweet and innocent love story of two best friends falling in love. That was one of the two main plots. The other one scared me speechless. Since there's insane serial killer killing off young girls. The most terrifying part in this book was when author wrote from the serial killer's point of view. Because she really did a good job, and I really didn't like to be inside killers head! It was really scary. Few times my phone rang during these parts and I nearly peed my pants! I was seriously scared in few occasions. And it was kind of thrilling, since nowadays I avoid scary books on purpose. But because of the supernatural elements and young love, I didn't find this book too scary. By the way, this was the first time I've read about two best friends falling in love, and I absolutely loved it. I had a suspicion it might be boring, since they've known each other always etc., but I was glad to see I was proven wrong, and I actually want to read more books containing this little twist. As mentioned earlier, what makes Violet so special is her ability to hear dead bodies, especially those who's been murdered. No surprise, she doesn't think her ""talent"" is an actual talent, or useful in any way. So it's nice to see how she starts using her abilities for the ""greater good"", but it's still quite creepy and scary as hell! It's creepy enough how she starts digging up bodies, but when she goes after the killer, I was actually physically terrified. I don't do scary books, so I was surprised to find this a great read. So, if you're up to be scared speechless and don't have any heart condition, feel free to grab yourself a copy! I just received the second book from the series and the third, The Last Echo is released in few days, so I'm all giddy now! Love, Monaliz @ Mind Reading?",Monaliz @ Mind Reading?
9780061779831,"Why did I wait so long to read The Body Finder? Last year I once read the summary and thought about it as a freaky murder mystery. Then Leanna @ Daisy Chain Book Reviews was always gushing about it and Nic @ Irresistible Reads named the male protagonist Jay her Book Boyfriend #3 and I bought The Body Finder in hope to maybe encounter a freaky murder mystery, but also a good romance. Now that I read it in only one day I need to say that this novel has so much more than just some good romance scenes. If The Body Finder weren't about gruesome crimes, I would call the kissing scenes that, forbidden, sweet and sexy crimes! Derting knows exactly what YA fantasy fans need to experience a reading night full of anxiety and longing with an insanely good and breathtaking novel. Kimberly Derting applies the perspective of an omniscient narrator. Most of the chapters follow the story of Violet, Jay and their families and friends. In the other few chapters our narrator slips into the perspective of the serial killer. Derting shows that there doesn't need to be a 1st person narrator to witness a character's own voice, experience his story and learn about his feelings. Each character has his own special voice. Violet is a very natural protagonist with a distinctive sense of justice and truth. Our male protagonist Jay is strong, protective, caring and I can't but be crazy about him. The potential for a new kind of love story is huge. This love story of Violet and Jay could be something really different, because they have been friends since they were little. Falling in love with your best friend and no stranger, not the new kid in town doesn't sound exciting or adventurous, The Body Finder could prove the opposite. Violet and Jay have known each other for so long, they know the other. Nevertheless there is so much more to learn about each other, to adjust to the new way of seeing and exploring the other. Violet is falling in love with her best friends, but could they ever be more than that and still be happy? Derting creeped me out with a cold-hearted and mad murderer. Reading his thoughts on chasing his victims, following and choosing them was scary. She played with my mind, making me make the weirdest accusations, suspecting everyone around Violet to be guilty, involved in some way. When I paused reading to go to the bathroom I glanced over my shoulder checking several times if someone was following me, I was so paranoid! Although Violet's gift, finding dead bodies of persons that were murdered, is supernatural, The Body Finder does not appear illogical or impossible. Hunting down the killer seemed so real, I felt involved and affected. Kimberly Derting did a great job writing her first novel, her writing style is excellent and no single page is boring or like the pages before it. I loved, loved, loved The Body Finder and am so mad that I hadn't ordered the sequel, Desires of the Dead in advance. It took several days to get here and right after my review is posted I'll continue the sequel to The Body Finder! THE VERDICT The Body Finder unites all senses to an unbelievable reading experience. It had all to keep me hooked: a dangerous supernatural gift, a murder mystery and an even more thrilling romance! If awesome novels were echoes, The Body Finder would be strongly calling to you. A must-read, go get it!",MissPageTurner
9780061779831,"Oh, I loved it. Believe me. I loved the idea of someone being able to sense murder (Violet should go the homocide department later on or something) and it was executed wonderfully. The entire novel kept me standing on my toes, just wanting more, more, MORE with every page. Yes, it was truly that great. While I think the middle part may had dragged a teeny tiny bit (for my taste anyway) the end and plot more than made up for it. I actually started suspecting random people and discarding the suspicion again, something I rarely do in crime novels because more often than not my suspicions are right and I've ruined yet another plotline for myself. And while I love my dystopian novels, it was a nice breather to finally read something to my original ""direction"" again (you're talking to a Harry Potter addict here). I don't necessarily mean contemporary, but I do mean a world that you can connect to, that you know. In most dystopian novels this cannot be and is not the case. I'm thrilled to read the sequel and I would just go out and buy it right now if I hadn't so many other books on my TBR pile ... so Desires of the Dead will have to wait a while. Believe me, though, if I had only two or three books to read, I'd just do the rude thing and ignore them and read Desires of the Dead.",Jill Barrakling
9780061779831,"Violet is a teenager with a creepy ""gift"". She can hear echoes the dead people, the ones who died murdered, leave. And she also sense the killers, since the echoes attach to them like an imprint. When several girls are murdered, and the police have no clues, Violet is only one who can find the killer. I read this book on my computer (still waiting for my Kindle to arrive) and even when my eyes begin to suffer, I didn't stop reading. Violet is one of my favorite characters, because she's normal expect for her gift. She loves her family, her friends, and her major worry is Jay, her best-friend. She tries to live with her gift the best she can, but she knows she can't ignore it. She's smart, and yes, she make mistakes as any other 16 year old, but I didn't think she was dumb or exaggerated. And I couldn't help but fall in love with Jay too. He's stubborn and sometimes controlling, but he has a sweet side. It's the perfect boyfriend combination. He's more mature that Violet, and worries about her safety, but he's also a little naughty, always teasing her. The writing is great, not too fast but not slow. The changes from Violet's pov to the killer's pov were interesting, because I knew what each of them were thinking. I wasn't expecting so much mystery but was very surprised to find a lot. I never figured out who the killer was (until the end, of course) and there were surprises. I loved this, not knowing what was going to happen and always feeling at the edge. And it was such a good thing, at least for me, that there weren't details about the murders. Just the kidnapings. It made it lighter and easier to read. Overall, I couldn't find anything wrong with The Body Finder. I love it, it's original and I won't forget about the characters. I can't wait to read the next book, Desires of the Dead.

9780141347332,"Out of the Easy is undeniably a good book. The writing is superb; Ruta Sepetys is a master of metaphors. She has a way with words that will sneak up on you and poke at your heart. Captivating story, actually. But I can't say I liked it very much. For one, the pace was too slow for me. It took me over a month to finish this book because it could not hold my attention for too long. I was expecting more thrill and mystery since the blurb mentions about a ""mysterious death."" Sadly, it fell short of my expectations. But on a positive note, there are no shortage of interesting characters in Out of the Easy. There's Cokie, Jesse, Willie, Sadie, Patrick, and even the girls at the brothel house. I'm not too keen about the main character, Josie, though. I mean, she's strong and head smart, but I just can't sympathize with her. I think my favorite part of the book was when Josie realized who Patrick was really in love with. That was an amazing turn of events. I almost believed they would end up together. Good thing they did not. The last quarter of the book was marginally better than the first parts. There's more action and less dawdling on Josie's part. Her problems were actually having solutions. Things were starting to look up, if only a bit. And then an amazing character dies. Sucks, right? I personally don't see why the author had to kill that particular character off, except maybe that it would be the only way for Josie to have the chance to decide for herself and escape her crappy life. It was sad but what actually moved me to tears was Sadie's gesture at funeral party. So simple yet so touching. Overall, Out of the Easy isn't bad. It's just not for me.",Julie Rimpula

If you enjoy fantasy/adventure or magical novels, this book is the right choice, though fair warning, if you are expecting a pony-land kind of fantasy book, this is not for you. This book treads lightly on a darker level of fantasy and magic. Although at some parts while Alyssa is in wonderland, the descriptions do seem a bit tedious to read, it was great nevertheless. Love the way A.G. Howard linked so many things, especially the family history etc back to the original Alice. Very creative and fun! Would def recommend this to the adventurous, curious minds.",Jessica
9781419704284,"I know I'm a little late in finally getting to read my e-ARC of Splintered from the wonderful people at NetGalley but I suffer from the common affliction us book reviewers suffer from. Procrastination. But that's a topic for a different blog post. At the end of February I finally got around to reading Splintered the first novel in debut author A.G. Howard's Splintered series after having it on my TBR list since August! I was so excited to finally have time and be in the right mood to want to read the book with minimal distractions that I dove right in. The book started off on a really high note. I loved Alyssa's dark awkwardness that she uses to keep the talking insects at bay with. It reminded me of the awkwardness that we all experience to at least some degree as teenagers and that made me really like her. As Alyssa herself is narrating her story I loved her ""voice"". She was such a breath of fresh air, I mean how often does one come across a socially awkward character that isn't just hamming it up? Exactly. Not to often I'm afraid. However, as the story went on I became rather disheartened with Alyssa, the other characters of the book and the over all story line. What started out wonderfully went slowly downhill for me after about page 100. For me it was as though Alyssa had lost her way. I get that the whole Wonderland thing threw a big wrench in her plans and the fact that her mother is institutionalized put a lot of pressure on her but it was as though she completely threw caution to the wind and stopped using her mind and became a rash decision maker which really caught me off guard. I also had issues with the other characters in the novel. Alyssa was the only one I really liked in the whole book at the outset but as for the others I didn't care for any of them much at all. I especially had issues with Jeb. I hated his big brother attitude where he got int the way of Alyssa's life too much and couldn't really grasp his appeal because of all that. The characters in Wonderland while I didn't dislike them totally were very one dimensional and I get that the author was trying to interpret them in new and unique ways but to me they were a little over the top even for a place like Wonderland. I especially detested Morpheus, there's so much about him I don't like I honestly can't see the appeal of him he was such a jerk to Alyssa! The story line also caused me some problems. As I said it started off fantastic but about 100 pages in it sort of lost the easy going pace it had in the beginning and for me it came together in a bit of a jumbled mess that I had to piece together. Sometimes the story would move so quickly I would have to go back and re-read a chapter or two just to catch what I missed and a time or two I was left with no choice but to move on becoming more confused. There seemed to be a lot of filler in Splintered that I feel the book could have done without and it became way too rushed for my tastes and I wish things were a little more cohesive I think if things went together better I would have liked the book much more. Despite all that though I did like what the author intended to do. Alyssa started off with a lot of promise and while I thought she lost herself for a large part of the story I did like where she was at as a person in the end. I liked that the author wanted to be different and I understand that a first novel is very much about an author testing the waters of their audience so I can totally see book two being really good. There was action, a love triangle, a lot of fantasy and humour mixed into the story and while the recipe's measurement may have been a little off I can see the series being very successful even if I thought Splintered could have been better. Overall, the book was an okay read for me and I seem to be in the minority about this but let me say that the author's story telling has a lot of talent and this is just my opinion of the book. I do know people who would absolutely love this book and I will have no issues in recommending this book to them. If you enjoy young adult fantasy novels especially ones that are re-tellings of popular novels and fairy tales I would highly suggest checking this darker more updated tale of Wonderland out and I can't wait to read the second book in the series when it comes out. *I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my free and honest review.

9781419704284,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Abrams and Netgalley.) Alyssa is hiding a secret. For the past six years, ever since she got her first period she has been able to hear plants and bugs talking, sometimes to her and sometimes to each other. As mad as this sounds, what scares Alyssa most is that her mother has been in an asylum for years for exactly the same reason. That's why she doesn't let anyone know what she can hear for fear of being locked up too. Alyssa has a legacy to uphold though, her ancestor was the real-life 'Alice' from the Alice in Wonderland story by Lewis Carroll, and now it seems that it is up to her to break the curse on her family, caused by the original Alice's actions. Desperate to save her mother more pain and unnecessary treatments, Alyssa searches desperately for a way back to Wonderland to break the curse, and eventually finds herself down the rabbit hole with her secret crush Jeb. Alyssa doesn't understand how things work in Wonderland though, and the man who guided her there - Morpheus may not be as trustworthy as he originally seemed. Can Alyssa possibly break the curse? Can she right Alice's wrongs and set Wonderland to rights? Or will she find herself tangled up in an even bigger mess? This was a total fairy-tale, filled with evil queens and helpless flowers! Alyssa was a fantastic 'Alice', and Wonderland was just so utterly strange and intoxicating. Wonderland was a work of art in its own right, with no attention to detail spared. I don't remember 'Alice in Wonderland' all that well, but each event in this book seemed to echo Alice's original adventures, just with the twist that Alyssa was trying to put Alice's wrongs to rights. The world building was elaborate and imaginative, and the storyline was new. There were also plenty of extra little touches to take this story from a copy, to a complex story in its own right. I really liked Alyssa, and her fashion sense made me an instant fan! Love the gothic fairy look! (Imagine the girl on the cover with a bit more black eye makeup and some blue dreds among the golden locks and that's the Alyssa in the story). She obviously wanted to help her mom, but she wasn't a martyr either, and she did make mistakes. She was sort-of unprepared for what Wonderland would throw at her, and there was an on-going theme throughout the book that in Wonderland nobody can be trusted, and nothing is what it seems. Jeb was a welcome addition to the story, with his continuous jokes and name-calling at Morpheus' expense, and a hidden alpha-male protectiveness of Alyssa. The little touch of romance was good too, although I wasn't overly impressed by the Alyssa-Jeb-Morpheus love triangle. On the negative side, I did get quite confused towards the end. I found all the different things that were going on, and all the different ideas and prophecy stuff hard to follow, and I'm still not sure I really get it now. The storyline was quite complex, especially towards the end, and trying to work out exactly who said what, when, where, and why and what effect that had upon Alyssa's present day situation was a bit difficult to follow, I think I'd need a pen and paper to try and work it out. Overall though, this was an interesting spin on the classic 'Alice in Wonderland' story, with depth and character of its own, and if you like fairy tales, you'll like this. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781419704284,"Absolutely gripping from start to finish, Howard has woven a whimsical and magical tale that has left me both thrilled and enchanted! Splintered's evocative imagery brought Wonderland and its inhabitants to life, lyrical prose had me dancing along its pages, while complex characterization gave the story depth and meaning. A companion novel to Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Splintered uses the Alice story as background in order to tell a new story - and Howard manages to perform this feat without disrespecting the original text. Everything from Alice is present - the white rabbit, the mad hatter, the smiling cheshire cat - yet it's tweaked in a way that makes sense, resulting in a darker and more twisted Wonderland for a slightly older audience. Both beautiful and terrifying, Howard's Wonderland oozed magic and intrigue, leaving me begging for more while the slight, yet clever, modifications to classic staples from the original Alice tale held me captive as I eagerly awaited the next character. Add in absolutely stunning descriptions of Wonderland's many landscapes, brought to life with Howard's lyrical prose, and I was completely and irrevocably hooked. The characters in Splintered were fantastic - Alyssa was self-conscious, yet confident and immediately relatable because of it. Her courage and selflessness when it came to protecting her family was so endearing, and she handled the teasingly slow reveal of family secrets with much more patience and understanding then I would have been able to muster. Jeb was a little overbearing in his protectiveness, but it also showed how deeply he cared for Alyssa in spite of the obstacles keeping them apart. Considering his harsh upbringing and resulting angst, it also made his softer, vulnerable moments that much sweeter, especially considering he never resorted to douchery to get his point across. And then there's Morpheus: a mischievously deceptive netherling with a Cockney accent, he spent the entirety of Splintered breaking my heart with his betrayal, only to mend it whole with a whispered explanation that painted him in a less selfish light. It frustrated me that I couldn't pin point his motives, but it made Howard's sneaky twist ending that much more shocking. I just can't even begin to do Splintered justice. Easily one of the most imaginative reads of the year, Splintered has left an aching desire in my heart to get lost amongst its magical pages, transported into a Wonderland that both thrills and terrifies me. Surprisingly unique, Splintered is creative fantasy at its absolute best!",Pretty Little Reader
9780545586177,"This book almost had me clawing my eyes out, raking my nails over my face and drawing my own blood in frustration, anger, disbelief, grief, amazement and a dozen other emotions I have no name for. I'm not even aware that I'm capable of feeling these mixed emotions all at once. It's a perfect follow-up to The Hunger Games and it did a really good job of keeping me on the edge of my seat until Mockingjay. This is beyond good, beyond awesome. But oh, Cinna.. Kind and gentle Cinna.. I don't think I could ever get over him just as I'll never get over Rue. The moment Plutarch showed Katniss his watch with the image of the mockingjay on it, I was sure he was on Katniss's side. But he rubs on me the wrong way and I can't help but distrust him. The opposite can be said about Finnick Odair, though. At first I was suspicious of him. But well, I'm glad he turns out to be a friend. It's just so sad about what happened to Mags and Wiress. They're victors and yet the Games made them into pawns. Expendable. But for me, they turned from victors of the Games into real heroes. Immortalized heroes that even the Capitol won't be able to take away from the people. Suzanne Collins amazed me again with the second book of The Hunger Games trilogy. The writing is superb as usual, the action is nerve-wracking and the world-building is realistically creative. A worthy sequel to The Hunger Games, this is one book you wouldn't want to miss out.",Julie Rimpula

9780758272829,"It took me a bit to get connected and warmed up to Gabriel. It didn't make me want to put the story down or anything because I was definitely looking forward to more in this paranormal world. It helped though with the characters of Layne and Simon. They are amazing secondary characters and I loved what they added to the story. I related with Layne because of hiding from popularity and adored the fact she was a brainiac. Simon is an athlete, but he's labeled a ****** because he's deaf. The connection that he and Gabe form over basketball is amazing and it really transforms both of them. Layne pointed out though that Gabriel lashed out when he thought people was on to him--the real him hidden under the gruff and rude at most times exterior. I thought that was really deep, and it was neat to see him internalize it and start to change. I also got to know Hunter more in Spark because of his friendship with Gabriel, and I think that its cool that he helped Gabriel to come out of this shell as well. I hated how his family doubted Gabriel at times in Spark, but I also was frustrated with him that he didn't let them in. But on the other hand, I totally got why he didn't want to tell them. He was finally doing something good with his power and learning control, so he didn't want to be forced to stop. It was also sad that he and Nick went through separation in here, but I know that in the end helped Gabriel to learn more about himself as an individual. There was also this great epiphany about how they all saw themselves as weak, with the least control, and as a liability to the others. Brigid has such a great style of writing. There is an amazing dynamic within the Merrick family and chemistry between the guys and the girls they like. The action scenes especially the ones with fire here in Spark are very vivid and beautifully and terrifyingly well done. While it wasn't a cliffie, there are definitely more questions that I need answered, and tied up. But we got answers and a semblance of a hea for Gabriel and his love. Bottom Line: Sparked a flame in my heart for Gabriel; great 2nd book in the series.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780758272829,"Favourite Quote: 'Her dad took a step forward. ""I'll have you arrested and changed with trespassing and statutory rape."" ""Then I'm going to need another fifteen minutes."" I absolutely LOVED this book so much! I enjoyed this book more than the first book (Storm) because I loved Gabriel so much more than Chris. He was hot, funny, sarcastic but could be sensitive and sweet when he wanted to be. Throughout this book I felt mostly pity for him because he was such an outsider even with his family. I was heartbroken for him when him and his twin Nick weren't speaking his pain felt so real, plus it was great to see into a twin's relationship compared to other sibling relationships and once again I loved the way the author wrote Gabriel's connection with fire it added another layer to the character. . The other main character was Layne who I also loved she was average teenage who loved to read but there was a lot of depth to her as well she has a lot of her own secrets. Gabriel and Layne's relationship was slow starting but builded up to be an epic romance. I loved that they could read each other perfectly and showed their true sides to one another. Such a good couple. Layne's younger brother Simon who was deaf stole my heart I absolutely adored him. He was so sweet and I hated every bad thing that happened to him because he didn't deserve it. I hope we see him again in future books. Once again I didn't really like Hunter and I know his book is next so I hope I warm up to him in that but in this book I knew he was up to something when he was friends with Gabriel. Really didn't like him after everything was revealed. Onto the plot like Storm it was very fast paced with lots of actin scenes many including fires Gabriel's element, and I actually didn't guess who the arsonist was! So that was a shock and the ending opens up more directions the plot could turn and I'm excited to read the next book! Overall I HIGHLY recommend this book and this series. I have absolutely no complaints about this book so it in my all time favourites!",brookexx
9780758272829,"I really enjoyed Gabriel's character in Storm so I was really looking forward to reading Spark and getting a look at things from his prospective. He's having a hard time lately. He's failing math and unless he can pick up his grade, he'll be kicked off the basketball team. Nick, his twin, starts dating a girl he doesn't like, and when Gabriel picks a fight with her for no reason, things get heavy between him and Nick and they don't speak afterwards. He saves the lives of some people caught in fires, but then gets accused of being the arsonist who's starting them. Anything that can go wrong for him is, but the light at the end of the tunnel is Layne. I found Gabriel to be quite witty and fun loving in Storm so I expected something different from this book, that's not to say I didn't enjoy it though, I really did. But Gabriel is having such a hard time and I really felt sorry for him. He is isolated from his family, and the only person he seems to have to fall back on is Layne. I enjoyed the relationship build up between himself and Layne, it's exactly the kind of romance I enjoy. Both of them indifferent to start with and it gradually grows into something special. The interactions between Gabriel and Nick really warmed my heart. They hadn't really made up but yet you could see how much Nick really cared for Gabriel. I have no experience with twins at all and I just loved the intimacy that the two of them shared. Michael softens a little bit in this too, and I felt we were starting to see a little bit of the old Michael from Elemental. Things finally seem to be looking up for him and I'm hoping that everything is going to work out. Hunter appealed to me a lot more in this book, I really started liking him too. I think it's probably because he wasn't part of the love triangle anymore lol. But I really found myself missing Chris and Becca, especially Becca. I don't think I realised how much I actually enjoyed her character in Storm, until I was only catching glimpses of her in Spark. Layne was a lovely character and such a sweetie. Her life seemed to be a struggle but she was strong and caring. She took care of her brother Simon who was deaf and who got bullied at school. Gabriel also builds up a friendship with Simon and it was really nice to see him also looking out for Simon. I felt both Gabriel and Layne had a lot of character growth in this and by the end, they are both more comfortable with themselves. Spark has a lot going on, it's fast paced and exciting and I definitely recommend it. I'm really excited for the next in the series, Spirit, which is from Hunters prospective.",Suzanne Finnegan
9780758272829,"(I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Kensington publishers and Netgalley.) This is the second book in the 'Elementals' series, and kicks off a couple of days after the end of book 1 'Storm'. This book focuses on Gabriel (one of the twins), whose element is fire. Gabriel is passing math because Nick (his twin) is taking his tests for him, and the new math teacher has called him on it. It's this that leads Gabriel to accept help from the girl who sits beside him in class - Laney. Laney lives with her over-bearing, lawyer, father, and her younger brother Simon who is deaf. Laney offers to help Gabriel, but doesn't realise what problems this will cause for her with her father. Laney and her brother Simon are both bullied at school, and Gabriel realises and steps in to try and stop it. There are fires being set around town on purpose though, and Gabriel's involvement leads the police and fire Marshalls to suspect him of being the arsonist, even though he is not to blame. Now Gabriel is in deep, and he's got no idea how he's going to get back out of the mess that he's in. Spark seriously sparked! I was glad I was reading this on kindle because otherwise I would have been worried about the pages catching fire! Gabriel is a misunderstood, tortured, bad-boy, with a heart of gold and I seriously could not get enough! Gabriel is seriously, seriously hot, and is definitely my favourite Merrick brother! Laney was so sweet and loving, and I hated the way the other girls bullied her, and the way the boys bullied her brother for being deaf. So unfair! I loved the blossoming romance between Gabriel and Laney and wanted loads more! Gabriel totally got the blame for everything in this book, even when things were definitely not his fault, and everybody just seemed to have it in for him. I felt really sorry for him and wanted to shout - 'But it wasn't his fault!' Overall; a fantastic second instalment, even better than the first!

9781416571735,"When I picked up Going Too Far I was in a bit of a reading rut. I wasn't sure if this book would help me to get out of it or not. It's a young adult contemporary romance, so it's a bit different than my usual paranormal reads. But really I had nothing to worry about because this was a phenomenal book. It hooked me very quickly and I literally sat down and didn't stand up again until I was finished. I just couldn't put it down! Jennifer Echols has a very easy-going and witty writing style which I immediately connected with. But what was most engaging about this book were the characters. Both Meg and John are extremely dynamic and layered characters whose layers are peeled away as the pages are turned. Not only is the chemistry between them absolutely sizzling, but each of them individually are characters who were built so well. Like real people, their past experiences shaped them and made them who they are today. Their little quirks, feelings, fears, and irrational actions are all because of things that have happened to them in the past. It makes such a huge difference in understanding and relating to them when you understand why they do the things they do. This book really blew me away. I loved the relationship and chemistry between Meg and John. But there were also huge surprises that I so did not expect throughout the entire book. Echols did an amazing job at giving us clues about certain things, without giving away the punch line. I'm really impressed. Overall seriously this is such an amazing book. It managed to get me out of a post-Thanksgiving week reading rut I was having and I will definitely be checking out more by Jennifer Echols in the future. You will fall in love with these characters and their blooming relationship, and you'll have trouble putting it down until you find out how it all turns out in the end. My only problem? There's no more of them! I wish there was more to read about Meg and John. I absolutely loved them.",I'm Loving Books
9781416571735,"Meg is a bit of a daredevil. Understatement! She and three others get caught on a railroad bridge. Trespassing and putting yourself in danger? The girl has lost all sense of self-preservation it seems. Arresting officer John After comes up with a way to teach them a lesson. He lives for the rules and makes sure they aren't being broken. An upstanding citizen! When Meg starts pushing his buttons (the ones he didn't know he had), he doesn't know what to make of it. Would letting loose sometimes really be that bad? Meg on the other hand needs to get over her rebel phase stat. Self-destruction is not the way to go about things. Will these two be a perfect match or a beautiful disaster? Having read the blurb I wished for a clean shaven guy and a blue haired girl on the cover. That wasn't the case. Normally I'm a big fan of close-ups, but for some reason I didn't like this one. The first chapters gave me a very good and accurate idea of who Megan was. A troubled teenager lashing out at the world - including herself. She didn't know what she wanted; just what she didn't. Most importantly, Meg seemed to be someone who should evaluate her way of life to change things for the better. At first, I didn't think she'd ever agree to this assessment. I had to smile at her blue hair, because I, too, had it for a year or so when I was a teenager. Meg was definitely a handful: Pot, alcohol, mouthing off on the cop. More pitiful than likable, but that's what made the character so interesting. There was hope! I very much liked the storyline. Her punishment to be exact. A great idea and it worked like a charm. There had to be a way to bring these two individuals together, and the author did a wonderful job. At first, Meg didn't know what to make of Officer John After. It took her quite some time to realize her previous assumptions were wrong. His stoic self drew me in. I connected with John right away. A man in uniform. Yummi! Then again, sometimes it felt like his uniform / his job is what defined him...and nothing else. Along the way you'll ask yourself many questions. Sometimes that was a good thing - a lot of the times, however, I wanted to get to the answer already. What should've been anticipation was impatience. Beware of Spoilers! Meg is claustrophobic and not knowing why drove me nuts. She kept everything close to the vest. I knew something must've happened to her to make her act like such a jerk. Defense mechanism at its finest! Same goes for her hatred of anything remotely similar to a plan. You have probably noticed that I didn't say whether I liked being kept in the dark or was annoyed by it. That's because I'm still not sure about the answer. Big issues - short read! Result? So-so. What I found absolutely endearing was when Miss Troublemaker suddenly realized she had a crush on John. Despite her attraction to him, she also noticed his unhealthy obsession with the bridge she and her partners in crime were trespassing on. In other words: She wasn't totally blinded by love. Thank god! It would've been very implausible (taking her previous wariness into consideration). I kept this observant streak of hers in mind and was disappointed that she didn't find out sooner what John's obsession was all about. Made no sense to me. A huge, HUGE plus? The interaction between Meg and John. True to their characters, funny, ... If I had to pick the one thing that I liked best about this book this would be it. Nonetheless, I had a really hard time deciding on a rating for this book. At page 95 I put it away...it took me a while to pick it up again. I liked it well enough, but it didn't blow me away. Character development? Oh yes! Also, I loved the ending. It's true that it takes hurting each other to let go of all the baggage and get a chance at a happy future together more often than one might think. In the end, it just wasn't enough. While reading, I often lost interest. The beginning was great; the ending was great, but the in-between - not the best young adult romance I've read. I think you should give it a try. But don't be disappointed if it isn't your cup of tea after all. 3 stars to Going Too Far by Jennifer Echols! Beware of Spoilers! A few of my favorite quotes for those of you who are interested: deg ""We were about to screw on a railroad bridge. It was a shame we didn't like each other very much."" deg ""I could sort of see how it wouldn't feel like hell on earth to be his wife."" deg ""...I admire him from afar, but I knew I didn't have a chance with him. Suddenly I wished my hair was not blue."" deg ""Art is the most effective form of communication."" deg ""I do my homework clearly was the mating call for their species.""",Saskia

9781416571735,"I had read several reviews about Going Too Far before I decided to buy it. I had kept staring at that beautiful cover a few times and asking myself what could have been behind it that so many readers were falling in love with it. Now I understand, now I don't regret myself for having bought and read it. Actually, I had a copy of Going Too Far since April, and I admit that at that time I wasn't in the mood to read a romance or something, so I just left it on the bookshelf. Until one day and a few hours ago, when I was supposed to read another story, a Fantasy one. I was in the mood to read a good and light and complete romance, so I run into my room and I picked up Going Too Far-not knowing what to expect from this. It was already 11pm, but I could read at least 50 pages until I fell asleep. I still wasn't so into the story when I stopped, but then in the following day, I picked up again from my bedside table and laid on my sofa. Then I was reading, flipping pages, being sucked by Echols' writing-even though I had felt kinda lost in the beginning, not because of the development of the story, but because of my own English knowledge, and in only a few pages I was already acquainted. I ended up reading Going Too Far all day long, carrying it with me all day long, thinking about how was it going to end all day long. I could not put it down. I read this 256-pages book in a little less than 24 hours, which I had never ever did in my whole life. I could find myself into that story, with Meg and John everywhere. Each of them had passed through a lot in their lives and maybe that's why they connected so well, so deeply. In front of my eyes, they argued with each other, they learned lessons from each other, they fell in love with each other. And it all was so completely complex. Their relationship and what they said are too complex, but still simple because it catches you and you can relate yourself to it. At the end, when I already had listened to many of their long and significant and challenging and entertaining and even lovely conversations, when I already had gone so many times to the diners with them and asked for The Meg Special so many times too, when I already had passed through all this with them, I cried. I cried just like Meg finally did, and it was like I could feel her pain and John's, too, somehow. I was way too absorbed by their story, like I never thought I would when I decided to dive into it. I'm more than happy that I read this book. I'm happy that I met Meg because she a lonely and beautiful girl who made me think about the way I look at blue (or pink, or orange, or green) haired people and don't even know what is behind them, who they really are, what they have been through in their lives, or why they dye their hair colorful. I'm happy that I found John After (such a charming and handsome guy) because, besides I'm truly in love with him (ha ha) and that he has such a beautiful smile with such cute dimples, he was deep, he was good, he felt so much pain that he could not allow himself to be rid of this pain anymore. And only Meg could do this. At last, but not least, I'm happy I found in Jennifer Echols' writing something I rarely have found these days. I found the characters' lines so real, fitting wonderfully well, that I kept some of them in my mind and so I was trying to retrospect everything in just a few minutes. I felt the complexity of the whole story-not that I have undestood every single thing, though. But I felt fulfilled. I felt that it was worth reading it. Overall, it was so much better than I had first imagined and I highly recommend everybody to at least pick it up to read once. Because, well... It has it all. It's funny, romantic, lovely, dangerous, intelligent, real. It's fantastic, incredible. It's unique.",Raila Soares de Assis
9780330519731,"The Cuckoo song is a strange tale of fantastical beings, strange occurrences, buried secrets and ultimately, family relationships of all shapes and sizes. Triss wakes up after nearly drowning on holiday and immediately feels out of place, the pages of her diary have been torn out and she can't quite remember things, such as where her bedroom is. Worse, her sister is screaming that she's not Triss and nothing she does can satisfy the hunger she has. This is a seriously weird, creepy book. Seriously. It starts off creepily. It ends creepily. With various pieces of creepy weirdness just scattered around everywhere. This is a book where I was never quite sure what would happen next and it was always the least expected thing - dolls screaming and poking the main character with pins, giant falling scissors, the main character crying spiderweb tears. Surprisingly, despite all the creepy weirdness, I actually found Triss's family the strangest, except for Penn. They expected Triss to look and act a certain way, kept her close and seemed most content when Triss was ill, so they could look after her. She has an odd relationship with both her mother and father as while they do keep her close, they're quite distant from her. Penn was the most interesting character in the story for me and watching her and Triss grow closer as siblings really made me invested in the story. I did wonder how we would keep the story going as I discovered the mystery before half the book had been read and while there was still a lot more story to to read and lots of events happening, it did feel slow in places. The part of the story Triss was called by a slightly different name and it really got on my nerves for a while to be honest but I can't really explain why. It was just irritating. This is a great fantasy read, albeit a really weird read, that I can definitely see on my shelves. I've never read anything like it, Frances really does have a very vivid imagination!

9780552554411,"This book completely changed my opinion on reading. I always enjoyed reading but never found it as interesting until reading this book. I had been searching for a book to read whilst on holidays along with some other of the Jacqueline Wilson teen collection such as girls in love, girls out late and girls under pressure. Whilst ordering the books I found kiss. I ordered it on a chance, I didn't even read the blurb. About a week into the holiday I decided to start reading Kiss. I literally couldn't put it down, I would read all day and at meal times until I had to eat. I would read at any available opportunity, it got to the extent of me staying up until 2 am reading it on the first day and then sleeping for a few hours and getting up 3 hours before the rest of my family to that I could finish it. I finished it in under 12 hours including sleep and meal times and out during the night. I'm not exaggerating at all!!! I would recommend this book to 12- 14 year olds to get the full love for the book. I read it when I had just turned 12 and I found it fascinating, it hints on quite troubling topics but not to full on for an early teens book. I read this book over 2 years ago and I would still read it again to this day.",Aria Lerman
9780451220899,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm as a part of my 'Old Review' feature. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Like I said in my review for Glass House, as soon as I finished the first book I leaped across my room to grab the second installment, The Dead Girls' Dance, and I immediately started to read it. As soon as my eyes hit the first sentence of the book I was sucked back into Morganville to see everything that was going on. Rachel Caine's writing makes me feel as though I'm really in the book with the characters. Every feeling that Claire has, I experience. The only thing I don't like about it is that Claire jumps into a new person too quick. I mean, I'm glad she's more confident now and more of a new person, because frankly at first she really bugged me. But still, it's a bit too fast. I still love her nonetheless though. As I do all the main characters, especially Eve. Nothing really changed about my loathing of Monica Morrell. Oh how I want to smack her! I also have a very high loathing for Shane's father now and all of his little back-ups. I really can't figure out which installment I like better right now, Glass Houses or The Dead Girls' Dance. I read through The Dead Girls' Dance just as fast as I did withGlass Houses, which I'm very happy about. But just as I did with The Dead Girls' Dance, I ran to Midnight Alley after finishing. And boy does Rachel Caine know how to leave a cliff hanger. It isn't really a cliff hanger, just a happy ending to a horrible day, that you just know will be destroyed again the next day. So that drives me as crazy as a cliff hanger does. Sometimes while reading these books, I feel as though some of the characters are thrown in just to fill some space and make the story longer. But by the end of the book they have resolved themselves, so that's good. But thinking about it really bothers me. But on a good note, and a not so good note, a lot of secrets and choices have been revealed now in the second installment to the Morganville Vampires series, so that means a lot more stuff is heading our way in Morganville. Overall, this was a great read, as was the first installment. I highly recommend this series; it's now officially in my top favorite series and recommendations.",Amanda
9780451220899,"Hold on to your fish-net stockings because the action in THE DEAD GIRLS' DANCE starts on the first page and never lets up. The story begins exactly where the first book in the Morganville Vampire series, GLASS HOUSES, left off. Claire, Eve, and Shane are in shock over what Shane's father and his buddies have done to Michael. Shane's father has returned to Morganville with one thing in mind: He wants to kill as many vampires as he can, even if he gets killed in the process. After the trauma Shane's family went through with the loss of his sister, and, subsequently, his mother, Shane and his father have cooked up a plan for revenge. Shane's phone call to his father sets the plan in motion and once his father arrives, Shane realizes what a mistake he's made. The protection Claire, Eve, Shane, and Michael have under the Founder is in jeopardy now that Shane's dad is causing problems. If they are thought to be involved in any kind of plan to kill the vampires, their protection will be removed and it will be open season on the occupants of the Glass House -- and believe me, there are plenty of vampires and people in Morganville who want to see them dead. When one of the most powerful vampires in town turns up dead, Shane is accused of the crime and sentenced to death, and it is up to Claire and Eve to find a way to save him. Readers will enjoy it when Claire's nemesis, Monica, gets a little of what's coming to her when the tables are turned and she is put in the victim role. Also be looking for relationships to blossom over the course of THE DEAD GIRLS' DANCE, both in love and friendship. We also meet a new, likeable character named Sam. He offers aid to Claire and Eve when they are in desperate need of help. The only drawback with this book is that it isn't a stand-alone story. In order to understand the reasoning behind much of the action it would be better to read the first book in the series, GLASS HOUSES. However, in my opinion, this isn't a major drawback at all since it leads you to another great book by Rachel Caine. THE DEAD GIRLS' DANCE is one of the best books I've read, and the shocking ending will leave you panting and begging for the next installment. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780786838196,"Frankie Landau-Banks has gone from geeky to gorgeous over the course of the summer, and she can hardly believe it when Matthew Livingston, the senior she worshipped from afar the year before, seems interested. But being Matthew's girlfriend comes with a lot of things Frankie didn't expect. She feels uncertain navigating the complicated politics of his social circle, and uneasy with the antics of his friends, which often seem to exclude her. Worst of all, she senses that he's not letting her all the way into his life--that, because she is a girl, he will never see her as an equal. Then Frankie discovers that Matthew is a member of the school's exclusive--and male-only--secret society. At first she only spies on them out of curiosity. But as her desire to prove herself every bit as capable as Matthew's male conspirators grows, she finds herself getting wrapped up in the society's business of sneaking and pranking, without any of the boys suspecting a thing. With Frankie pulling the strings, anything is possible. THE DISREPUTABLE HISTORY OF FRANKIE LANDAU-BANKS is one of those rare books that is equal parts entertaining and thought-provoking. Frankie's exploits are full of humor, suspense, and drama, but she's not afraid to stop every now and then and consider the consequences of her actions. Her insecurities make her as believable as her smarts and her guts make her admirable. Readers will be cheering her on from beginning to end--and wondering how the things she learns along the way might apply to their own school adventures long after they've put the book down.",TeensReadToo

The opening sentence hooks the reader; they will devour the whole book quickly and ask for more. Zoey's life is about to change forever. She woke up one morning normal and by the end of the day she's been marked. Being marked indicates that she will turn into a vampire. She needs to leave her family and friends behind and start a new life with other marked teens at the House of Night. Zoey's never completely fit in, but now she might have a chance. After a fight with her mother and stepfather, Zoey goes to her grandmother's house for advice. Before seeing her grandmother, Zoey has a vision of the Goddess Nyx, who states that she is special and names Zoey her personal eyes and ears in the world. Zoey faints, but not before the Goddess replaces her mark with a blue crescent, which is extremely rare. When Zoey arrives at the House of Night, she finds herself the object of attention because of her crescent. Her roommate and her new acquaintances quickly find their way into Zoey's heart. She finds herself surrounded with friends for the first time, but she also encounters a powerful enemy.

The book is like Harry Potter of vampyres - thats how i first described the book to my friends...Its probably ment for the younger readers but i think its not so much for the youngest (it has some sexy / sex scenes and maybe some more adult language)... Its quirqy (al the caracters are so different but yet so together), sexy (all the hot male caracters of course), dangerous and addictive....

9780758272812,"I read this book in October 2012, and reviewed it on my blog on January 10. Gore: No Magic: Yes Romance: Yes Action: 5 stars Pacing: 4 stars Plot: 4.5 stars Cover: 3 stars Becca Chandler is girl who's having a rough school life, it's because of her ex-boyfriend soccer player, who spread lies about her, which people at school believed and now people think she's going out with half of the school. Because of this, she took a self-defence class which is after school. She thought that it would be a normal evening after that, but she didn't expect to end up being in a fight (two boys were beating up another boy in the school parking lot way after school). At first she's not sure what to do, since those guys are a lot bigger than her, but then she decides to save the boy using her car to scare the other two boys away, then she finds out who the victim is, his name is Chris Merrick, who is in a few of her classes, but she never talked to him before and she doesn't know much about him either. Unfortunately, because of her interference, the other two boys think she's one of them, an elemental. An elemental is someone who can control one of the four elements, although, only the Merrick brothers are known to have so much power that they're really dangerous, which is why other Elementals want them dead, they're scared. Chris' element is water. When Becca finds out about Chris and his brothers' powers, she's in more danger than ever. The arrival of a new kid at school, who is Becca and Chris' age, seems to make things more complicated. As more and more bad things happen, Becca must figure out her real friends are, and who she should stay away from. I enjoyed reading this book. I liked Chris and Becca both, although at some points, Becca kind of annoyed me, but I still like her. I love that she at least tried to defend herself, so she wasn't exactly a damsel in distress, because she was kind of like a normal girl, except for those rumours about her. Chris seemed boring at first, but later on in the story I started to like him. Becca thought that she was in love with Hunter, but many times, when a person feels safe and things are a bit too easy, while the other person seems dangerous, doesn't always mean that you're right. I don't hate Hunter, in fact, it seems obvious that he's confused and doesn't know what to do, but unlike others, when Becca thought that she was in love with him, I didn't feel much romance between the two. I liked this book a lot better than the novella, Elemental, that takes place five years ago, but I wish that there was more information about what happened to Emily, since Elemental didn't really have an ending, and we only get a little bit information about what happened to her in this book. I hope that we will get more information about her accident in the next book. We learn more about the Elementals and their community. A lot happens in this book. I kind of expected one of the twists near the end of the book, and the other one, not so much. The ending is not a cliffhanger, but I still want to read the second book right away. I have it, but I haven't read it yet. I love that this series also has something different in it, like with Soul Screamers and the Lux series, this series has something different, you guys know that I'm getting tired of seeing too many vampires, werewolves, faeries, and zombie books, and that I love reading about different supernatural stuff (I know, I said different too many times in this sentence, but I can't think of what other words to use). I'm trying to stay away from vampire books for a while, there's a big rant I did about that, which I'm not going to post, this post will be way too long then, and I don't think that anyone is interested in reading a rant about creatures in books that I'm tired of. I like that the future books in this series will focus on and be the POVs of a different brother, including Hunter each book, like: the second book is from Gabrielle (one of the twins) POV, and the third one will be Hunter's POV, etc. At the end of this book I did still had some questions that needed answering, but that's expected knowing that this is the first book in a series, I can't wait to see what will happened in the next books. Overall, I enjoyed this book. I kept flipping page after page, eager to know what happened next. Storm is entertaining, has good writing and flows nicely, is funny, has action in it, has some romance in it, and an enjoyable read. I recommend this book. I rated this book: 4.5 stars.

9780758272812,"I liked this book, and it was a quick read with plenty of action. All of the Merrick brothers blended together for me at first. Nick, Gabriel, Michael and Chris. I guess Chris not as much as the others because he is the one beaten and where Becca gets pulled into their world. But they were all thrown in at once, and I just didn't get a good feel for them. I started to realize their roles and differences around Chapter 5 and 7 though. I liked Becca's voice and personality, that she was taking self defense classes at the beginning, and she used those skills to help out someone in trouble. It showed a lot about her character, because she could have just hidden and ran off, but she stood up to a bully and defended herself and someone else. Also, just her way of speaking and thinking had me able to relate to her. I was also amazed at how much pain she went through and still could love others and empathize with them. Yet, she still had this fire in her, and I loved when it was righteously funneled. The theme of bullying is so important. It is So hard and and shows the destructive power that words and rumors can have. Like how she learned to stand up for herself and wasn't just being helpless. New guy aka hunter was hot and I appreciated how respectful he was to Becca. I couldn't help but wonder if there was more to him that it seemed since he came onto the scene just as Becca knew the truth about Chris and his brothers. Although I liked Chris, I couldn't help but think for most of the book that it would be better for Becca not to be involved, that up front, Hunter seemed like a simpler and safer option. But that was not fair because Chris didn't control who he was only what he tried to do with it. And I respected his closeness with his family, and how he was learning control. The reasons why he tried to be distant from Becca to start with were really good, because he didn't want her to be in danger. But I loved how he stood up for her, and admired her strength. I just don't think that he was given a fair chance, and I want to see more of them together. I liked the humor that was laced in. There was chemistry with both guys and I was in the same position as Becca, not seeing the whole picture for most of the story. I was shocked at how it played out, and how all of the threads of the story came together.

9780758272812,"Favourite Quote: ""Nick smiled. ""I kind of like the irony."" ""Jesus, you are such a nerd."" Gabriel flung the lighter at him. ""Stop using big words."" ""Five letters is a big word?"" This book was another 5/5 stars for me. Mainly because the characters are just the best! Seriously, they were all hilarious, I laughed my way through this entire book. Let's start with Chris, the youngest brother whose element is water and he is one of our P.O.V characters. He's kind of average compared to his brothers in my opinion but I still thought he was sweet and cute but also had protective, angry side to him. I loved the way the author wrote and description Chris's connection with water it was done so creatively to the point were I almost felt a strong connection to water! It really helps the reader understand Chris's character. I especially loved his relationship with his brothers, the family element in this book was done extremely well. We got to see the other brothers but I'll talk about them when their books are released. Our other P.O.V is Becca whose up there with the Merrick family in how hilarious she is. I guessed the main twist with her from the very beginning but the other twist involving her family I was really surprised at. Chris and Becca's relationship is hot and cold throughout the entire book, their relationship is still kind of unsolved by the end. Their main problem was the character Hunter who I wasn't very fond of, he was my least favorite character because I felt something was off about him. Even now I've read the second book I still don't like him. Okay, onto the plot. This is very action packed right from the first page, the scenes were all done very well so I loved them. There were numerous sub-plots some I felt were kind of unnecessary but they didn't take the focus away from the main plot so I wasn't too bothered. The ending was not wrapped up but that was okay because there is more books in the series. Overall I highly recommend this book, one of my favorite books this year!.",brookexx
9780758272812,"This book has been getting a lot of hype, so I was a little wary going in. If your expectations are too high, you'll be disappointed no matter what, but if you expect a bad book, you're likely to be harsh on it. When the book opened up, I was excited that it gets right to the point with Becca saving Chris. We then meet the brothers, and I really wanted to punch all of them. The pace of the plot felt a little slow at first, but it actually really isn't. Every scene has a purpose and the buildup to all the fun stuff like finding out more about Chris and his brothers and the romance triangle with Hunter, Becca, and Chris. The character development and progression of the conflict is written so precisely to make the anticipation of each big moment exquisite. I ended up loving the brothers, despite their flaws and hanging on every word waiting for the next ""storm"". There are a lot of very emotional topics tackled in this story ranging from family dynamics to high school social dangers. Of course there's also some supernatural ethics included too, making for a very dramatic read. I cried here and there, hung on every word, and spent all night unable to put it down. Brigid Kemmerer weaves a stunning tale that is mesmerizing and enthralling as it provides an intricate plot full of magic, suspense, and sweet romance. Storm is an awesome start to a fun series and I will recommend it to all my friends that love a good YA read!",Hillary Curran
9780758272812,"Wonderful! I managed to read this book in one day. Always a good sign, I think. This book moved at a fast pace and had enough action to keep me glued to the pages. Four hot brothers, Michael, the twins Nick and Gabriel, and the youngest Chris. They all have a power of the elements. They are pure elemental's so they are extremely powerful. So much so, that other elemental's feel threatened by them and would like to see them dead. They constantly get beat up and harrassed by other families in the community who know what they are, especially Seth and Tyler, also elementals, but not as powerful. Becca is leaving her self defence class one night, when she sees a guy being beaten up by two guys. The guy is down, seemingly unconscious, but they're still kicking him. Her phone is dead, and afraid they're going to actually kill him, she uses the only weapon she has, her car. She drives toward them yelling that she's called the police and this scares them off for a bit. The guy on the ground is Chris Merrick, from her school, but she doesn't really know him. Between the two of them, they manage to get Chris into the back of the car and get away. But this puts her in the line of fire from Seth and Tyler too. Becca was a really likeable character who I took to straight away. She is emphatic and brave. Her and Chris seem to come together a lot now but their relationship kind of flashes hot and cold. The new kid, Hunter, also shows an interest in Becca, so we do have a love triangle which was annoying but worked out for me in the end :) I really liked the Merrick brothers too. Michael is a bit of an ass in this so I was glad I'd read Elemental and got more of an insight into this character before starting Storm. Nick is a serious character who appears to be the more intelligent of the twins, while Gabriel would come across and more fun loving and carefree. They often switch places for tests and sports. And Chris was really cute and likable. The next book in this series, Spark, is centred around Gabriel. I'm looking forward to finding out more about him and his powers as a fire elemental.",Suzanne Finnegan
9780758272812,"(Source: I won a digital copy of this book ) This is the first book in the 'Elementals' series. Chris Merrick is an Elemental, this means that he has an affinity for one of the elements - in his case water - and can harness its energy for his own use. Becca is sick of people gossiping about her and spreading rumours behind her back, all thanks to her footballer ex-boyfriend. She thought that a self-defence class would help, but she didn't expect to stumble upon two boys beating up another boy in the car park after class. Using her car to scare off the attackers, she goes to help the victim, who turns out to be Chris Merrick, a boy that she knows only vaguely from school. Things are about to get complicated though when the two boys who attacked Chris begin to think that Becca is an elemental too, and begin to attack her too. The arrival of a new kid at school seems to only add complications, and as the trouble esculates, Becca must work out who her real friends are, and who she should be hiding from. I enjoyed this book. It totally grabbed my attention, and I found myself at nearly 20% without even realising it. Chris was an interesting character, although there was more romance coming from the new boy - Hunter, with regards to Becca. It was actually really difficult to choose between the two boys at several points during the book, even when we knew that Becca would probably end up with Chris. I liked this book a lot better than the novella 'Elemental', but I wish that we could have gotten a little more information about what happened to Emily, as Elemental didn't really have an ending, and we only really got hints as to what happened in this book. I can only hope that we will continue to get information on this in the next book! I liked the storyline in this book, it was well written and flowed nicely. I like that the future books will focus on different brothers and am really interested as to see where this story goes. There was a bit of a twist at the end of this book, part of which I saw coming, and part that I didn't! At the end of this book I did still have questions that needed answering, but knowing that this is the first book in a series, that's kind-of expected. I would have liked there to have been a bit more romance between Chris and Becca rather than Hunter and Becca, but this didn't spoil that story.

9780192792952,"Soulmates, a concept of love and intimacy many people want to believe in to explain a pretty amazing bond between two people.When I started FINDING SKY I hoped for exactly that idea of soulmates unfolding and a cute romance between our protagonists to develop. Unfortunately both, Zed and Sky didn't really grow on me. From the beginning Zed is unfriendly and everything but courteous to Sky. Call it bad boy behaviour, but I just didn't like it. She still starts to develop a crush on him based on his looks and the magnetic pull he has on her. And then at some point into the story the instant love finally sets in. I didn't believe in them like in other couples, because he is suddenly totally into Sky and then she's the one to decide to keep away. A Tug o' war of stupidity. I didn't feel the connection between both characters, but that could've been because I didn't feel a connection to Sky either. It doesn't happen often that I dislike main characters that fast and determinedly, but sometimes it just doesn't click. You probably know that phenomenon all too well. Sky was too innocent and childish for my taste to come across as a touch and admirable heroine. Every single of her conversations with other people and her parents felt like that, too, like explaining a little kid what it has to do. What I liked about FINDING SKY are the different paranormal talents Sky, Zed and his family have. I'm always a fan of weird powers to goof around and save the world with. Then there are the antagonists who have powers of their own and who make the story a bit more interesting and less dragging. The intricate leafy design on the cover continues to decorate every new chapter of FINDING SKY. A graphical plus that unfortunately doesn't help to enhance the book's week content. THE VERDICT FINDING SKY- Soulmates with superpowers and a bunch of evil people against them, nothing new. Another instant love, unconvincing leading characters and very slow story flow. You might still be interested in Joss Stirling's concept of soulmates though. And FINDING SKY could be something for people who like music inspired books, because music's also a large part of Sky and Zed's story.",MissPageTurner

9780061969577,"I Am Number Four is one of those books that I've read so much about it that I didn't want to read it, specially because of the author thing. But anyway, I was curious and decided to read it, and here is my review... Number Four is an alien. His planet was destroyed and he was sent to Earth. But, the same people who destroyed his planet are here on earth, and they are looking for him. Four is a 15 years old boy, who is used to live hidden and running. Every time something weird happens, he and his guardian escapes. It's a boring life until they reach Paradise, a small town. I Am Number Four is a interesting story. The aliens from Lorien are practically extinct, and the few who reached earth are lost or dead. Everyone of them has a power, and just now number four is developing his first. Number Four, or John, is a pretty common boy...except that he's an alien. He's the typical 15 years old guy, bored and without any interest until he met Sarah, the beautiful girl, and Sam, the geek/aliens lover guy. At the beginning the writing was slow, because John explains everything about Lorien, their powers, etc. But at the middle of the book there is more action, because the bad aliens found John, and everything turns into chaos. I liked the characters and though the story was original, but the book didn't grab me as others. I liked it and read it pretty fast, but I think the characters could have been deeper and the story had more to tell. Although, I accept that my perception of the book is tainted with everything I read before about the author. For example, my mother read it and loved it, and she doesn't even like young adult books! Overall, I Am Number Four is a book I liked enough to read the next one, called The Power of Six, which is going to be released August 23, 2011. I recommend it to everyone who likes sci/fi, it's an interesting book and a story that promise more action.",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9781444714487,"Theodore Boone is John Grisham's first book for children and wasn't disappointing! Great plot and very different to most children s books. Extremely clever, classical Grisham. Soaked with description, filled to the rim with adventure and edge of your seat climax. Sure to be a classic. Looking forward to the ones to come! By Harrison Dalby 11 years of age. New Zealand",peter dalby
9781444714487,"As a retired Teacher Librarian I take a great interest in new books for young people, so when I picked up this book I had great hopes that Theodore Boone would be the Alex Ryder* of the legal world. But it was not to be. While the book has a promising hero in a thirteen-year-old wannabe lawyer who discovers the truth about the perfect murder, Grisham has squandered his opportunity, and I cannot figure out why. The book opens with young Theo navigating his way confidently around the Law Courts and his parents' law chambers, knowing the people, the terminology and the law better than any child of his age ought to do. A true nerd, he is squeaky clean, too good to be true. He goes everywhere on his bike but he never gets his hands dirty, kicks a ball around, plays a musical instrument, or ever hangs out with friends unless it is to help them solve their families' legal difficulties. Something about his one-dimensional character just doesn't ring true. So what else makes this book so weak? Firstly, the blurb is seriously misleading. To quote the blurb, ""The stakes are high, but Theo won't stop until justice is served."" And ""...Theo finds himself in court much sooner than expected when he is dragged into the middle of a sensational murder trial."" Whoever wrote this blurb hasn't read the book - Theo never finds himself in a courtroom other than as an interested spectator. My second, and far more serious complaint, is that the ending of the book is completely missing. Did Grisham stop writing when he reached a mandatory word limit? Did he finish writing the book on the train on his way to work? Did he run out of time or budget? Why did he drop the plot at a point where so much more drama should take place? I just don't understand. He leaves the reader completely stranded, waiting for a denouement that never happens. The last three pages are nonsense, a completely unnecessary ending to what could have been a far better book. It would make more sense to condense the first 250 pages, cut a lot of the dialogue, throw in much more action, and finish the novel as it should be finished. And now we come to Omar Cheepe. What a perfect name for the bad guy. But why do we never discover what Omar Cheepe is meant to be doing and for whom, and who is he? Cheepe is supposed to be the bad guy, but what makes him bad? Nothing much. He noses around and appears to follow Theo at crucial times but never approaches or threatens him. He is curious about who is in an office with the Boone family and what is being discussed, but he does nothing to find out. Does he wait around to see who leaves? Does he do something drastic to flush them out? No. He simply drops out of sight at a time when he should be putting up a fight, finding out what the other side knows and bringing matters to a climax. But there is no climax, and the whole book goes belly up. The plot fizzles and dies, and the reader shrugs and makes a mental note to give the book away to the nearest op-shop. Endings are Grisham's weakness, but this is ridiculous. It troubles me that Grisham has written so many fast-paced legal novels, replete with twists and turns, surprises and shocks, but now in writing this novel for young adults he has compromised his own standards. I blame the publishers (and there are several, it appears) for meekly accepting the manuscript simply because it was written by Grisham. It really troubles me that his editor has not looked him in the eye and insisted that he finish the novel properly. A further fifty pages would do it, and the reader would have a worthwhile ending, a courtroom drama worth reading, and a reason to recommend the book to others. For a novel to satisfy the reader, it should have more than a simple linear plot. There should be subplots woven around the central issue in ways that further the main plot, intersecting at times that suit the action. By weakening this structure, Grisham has insulted his readers' intelligence and underestimated their ability to assimilate a more complex plot structure. Moreover he has diluted his language to the point extent that tells the entire story in a child's voice. Clearly he knows very little about Young Adult fiction and until he learns how to construct a Young Adult novel, he should stick to what he does best and just write for the adult market. * Alex Ryder is the teenage hero of Anthony Horowitz's brilliant series of spy novels for teenagers - Stormbreaker etc.",S Levy

9781907410284,"I started reading Nightshade with high expectations, because there were so many positive reviews about it, and they weren't disappointed, rather exceeded. Nightshade is located in the fantasy genre, it combines elements of our human world with otherworldly experiences and elements of the animal kingdom. As many other werewolf novels before, Cremer achieved to create a unique picture of a new werewolf world. But as I noticed in no other novel before, she gifted humans with animal-like gestures and wolves with human feelings. The wolf-like gestures Cremer describes appear so natural, she must have been living with a pack of wolves studying their every movement to create such a coherent picture. The transition between human and wolf form of our heroine Calla and her pack mates is always fluid and there are no abrupt breaks of change or for example loss of memory. I like the fact that Cremer's werewolves get the chance to control both forms and connect emotions, memories, mimics and gestures with both of them to extend their personalities to their fullest. Her characters are comparable to no other. Our heroine Calla is strong and fearless in war, an alpha, but when it comes to love and controlling her heart she is totally lost in a maelstrom of feelings. Her heart is torn between desire and duty, between Shay and Ren, a human boy and her destined male alpha. Shay and Ren are characters just as strong as Calla regarding my affections. Nightshade is the first novel that doesn't let me fall for the forbidden but appropriate love couple, the boy who I don't expect getting the girl! Other novels know how to direct my attention at the ""right"" hero, the one who always gets the girl and doesn't break my heart by being abandoned. That Ren totally got me just shows the talent of Cremer to create powerful and tempting characters. I will hope till the last page for Ren and Calla, and even if their relationship doesn't work, there will always be a place in my heart for Ren, sexy and more than selfaware on the outside, but vulnerable and insecure at heart. Cremer created a love triangle I am more than interested in, but she also involves sub plots that are no less thrilling and important for the course of the story. In the end of Nightshade I care about every single character, who are all so varied and well-thought-out. Furthermore she applies a writing style, that is one of the best I've got to experience so far. She has a good feel for syntax and choice of words, the right sense for plot arrangements, just as my favourite author would be capable of. This novel is a mixture of romance combined with a love triangle, supported by slightly erotic but esthetic elements, which make it a very seductive and exciting read! Nightshade surprised me like no other novel before by applying a major plot point, change in nature and character so early. As Nightshade is just the first novel in a trilogy I would have expected this certain plot point being part of the third novel. Then after a moment of confusion I really appreciated the idea of involving aforesaid surprising event in Nightshade, because it makes me think of the huge events and surprises Cremer has planned for the next two instalments and makes me giddy. I can't wait for Wolfsbane to come out! Cremer opened the gates to a new realm of werewolf novel that keeps your heart hammering against your rip cage, your mind busy with the magic of Nightshade and your body in the arms of your favourite alpha. Although it stands out due to a high complexity in word, characters and world, Nightshade can be easily described by a single word: perfect! THE VERDICT I was so happy about receiving a shiny Nightshade proof copy, it was my very first ARC that was sent to me after a request. There couldn't have been any better novel to be my first ARC! Nightshade overwhelmed me, it played with me, gave me room, took it away again and left me breathless after numerous chapters, especially the last one. It immediately became one of my favourite books of 2010, and I know it is on top of many other 2010 Best Books blogger lists, which is a really great achievement for a debut author, but Andrea Cremer deserves each single praise! I highly recommend reading this novel, it is one of 2010's great and will always be granted a place in my all time favourites.",MissPageTurner
9780547258553,"Alex Morales is a 17-year-old Puerto Rican boy living with his family in New York. He has two younger sisters, Briana and Julie, and his parents, who he calls Mami and Papi. Everything is going pretty normally for Alex. He's the vice president of his school council and he's looking forward to getting into a great college. But in one moment everything changes. Something huge hit the moon and knocked it out of place. It's now closer to Earth, causing a lot of horrible changes, including tidal waves, flooding, blackouts, and overall panic. According to many people, the Earth is coming to an end. Alex's father was in Puerto Rico when it happened and they haven't heard from him since, and his mother was called in to the hospital where she works. Alex is afraid that since she hasn't contacted them that she died when there was a flood in the subway. All of a sudden, Alex realizes that he is the sole caregiver to his two sisters. He has no idea when his parents will be back (if ever) and he's terrified. People all around New York are dropping like flies. Bodies line the streets. People are going crazy trying to get their hands on food. Nothing that seemed important before is important now. All that matters is staying alive. And Alex is determined to care for his sisters and keep them alive no matter what. But is that really possible with what has happened to the Earth? Wow, this book was intense! It's scary in all ways possible. Reading about the bodies lining the streets of New York brought shivers to my spine. It's hard to explain in words how crazy this book is. If you like really intense books then this is definitely a story for you. Also, be sure to read Ms. Pfeffer's previous release, LIFE AS WE KNEW IT, which deals with the same issue that's discussed in this book but with different characters. I haven't read it yet, but I'm sure it's just as good and frightening as THE DEAD & THE GONE.",TeensReadToo
9780061450556,"After I finished reading the summoning, I went right away to my school's library to read the sequel. I was able to read it within the span of 3 days. I enjoyed it so much that I could hardly put it down. I had a lot of high hopes from the first book, and this book didn't fail to deliver a great novel with amazing suspense, romance, and general creepiness. Reasons to Read: 1.The Mysterious Edison Group: In the first novel, we heard about the Edison Group, but not a lot was revealed about them. Don't get me wrong, they're still very mysterious, and again only a bit is revealed about them, but the whole thing is just so fascinating that you have to keep reading, because you just can't wait to piece together everything. While this is not a particularly new idea, I think that the group is still really interesting nonetheless. 2.More action: There wasn't a lot of action in the summoning, except for around the second half of the book. There were a lot more action and fight scenes, which I enjoyed. While many of them are against the Edison Group, a fair number of them are also against other groups of people. It was nice to see other types of foes in the novel, besides just the main villains. 3.The Non-Frustrating Love Triangle: Like I've said before, I'm not a huge fan of love triangles. I'm constantly cheering for the guy who will inevitably lose, and I end up hating the other for it. I genuinely liked the two guys in this love triangle: Derek and Simon. They are both very, very different. Derek is the typical tall, dark, and handsome guy, while Simon is the classic boy-next-door. They both have a lot of chemistry with the protaganist, which I think is why I like this triangle so much. In some areas of the book Chloe bugged me a little bit because she refused to use her powers to protect herself, so she wound up being the damsel in distress a lot of the time. She did get a bit better by the end of the book, though, which I was glad of. While I didn't like this book quite as much as the previous, I think that it continues the story very well from where it leaves off, and makes a great addition to the Darkest Powers series.",Dorian
9780061450556,"Not too long ago, Chloe Saunders was an ordinary teenage girl with dreams of making movies when she got older. Today she is a necromancer who has no idea how to control her powers or even what all of her powers are. In book one of the DARKEST POWERS series, THE SUMMONING, Chloe and several of her friends escaped from the group home they had been living in. Now, Chloe and Rae are recaptured by the Edison Group, a shady organization that has genetically altered them to try and make use of the powers that many of them were born with. I found THE AWAKENING to be well-written, descriptive, and thoroughly engaging. This book had soul-searching, action, and even a little teen angst - although it only had a little to do with being a teen and a lot to do with being a supernatural with very little control over their lives or their powers. I would definitely recommend this book to others. Kelley Armstrong already has two popular adult series under her belt, and this is well on its way to being her third, and hopefully only the first for teens! I hope to see much more from her in the future.",TeensReadToo
9781401236809,"This is my first time ever reading Supergirl and I enjoyed this introduction to her. The New 52 introduction is a set-up story giving Kara her background arrival on earth. She doesn't know what is going on, where she is, and finds she has superpowers. She's rip-roaring mad and when Superman makes an appearance she takes it out on him. That was a lot of fun! There is a story in here that has Kara up against some creatures called the ""Worldkillers"" and there is some sort of secret between them, her father and Krypton but that plot is settled for the time being and the next volume is ready to start a fresh story. We don't get to know Supergirl much as she's angry and stubborn most of this book but I'm pretty ok with her look, costume and she's muscular, certainly a good look.

9780061998669,"(Source: I own a copy of this book.) 16-year-old Kyle is rich and good-looking, and he knows it. When a girl calls him on it though, and says that he needs to look past beauty, he plays a cruel prank on her, and she returns the favour by cursing him - to be a beast, unless he can find true love, in his beastly form. Kyle believes that no-one will ever love him, so he hides away, or rather his father hides him away. Can Kyle find someone to love him? And can he do it before it's too late? This was an okay re-telling of beauty and the beast, but it wasn't anything new or exciting unfortunately. Kyle was a typical spoiled selfish teenager, and he deserved to be taught a lesson. The problem was that I just didn't buy his reformation. When he started gardening and reading classic novels, it just didn't feel right, it felt false, like he was pretending to be something he wasn't, and when he then began to think more of others it felt really false too. It just seemed so out of character for him, and like he was trying to be something that he wasn't. The storyline played out as you would expect from beauty and the beast, but the small changes to the plot didn't really do it for me. The whole thing felt cliche, and I didn't really believe that Kyle was reformed or learning anything which was kinda the point of the story. There were also these 'chat' sections during the story which were supposed to be Kyle chatting online, but they just annoyed me too to be honest. Overall; this was an okay re-telling of beauty and the beast, but there was nothing new or exciting. 6.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780061998669,"...it felt like an adult trying to guess the technology and language her kids are using online in the extremely unnecessary chat room excerpts. It was an interesting idea (various fairytale characters convene in an online chatroom to air their woes) but I didn't like it and felt that it detracted from the otherwise good story. Plus it really annoys me when authors use bad grammar, bad spelling and current slang that will date very quickly in novels... srsly ppl, it gets old quick. In terms of the narrative, I really liked it! Kyle is delightfully cocky and arrogant, so we delight in seeing him fall, and then get to see his redemption with the aid of a refreshingly normal heroine. The way that Finn weaves in the magical elements was done well, and didn't clash with the modern setting. Although everyone already knows the classic story, a few additions and alterations kept it fresh. A quick and fun read.",Lisette Muratore
9780061998669,"Ok, so I actually saw the movie before I read the book. Something I usually never do because I like to be able to imagine the story first and then see it come to life in a movie. Beastly was a cute and quick read. It's a modern day retelling of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. The writing style was easy to get in to and I enjoyed the story being told from Kyle's point of view. I liked seeing his character evolve throughout the book. His thoughts on how Lindy would perceive him were interesting, but sad. Lindy was kind of pathetic to me. As I was reading, I expected for her to be a cute, slightly nerdy but nice girl (as she was in the movie). But she proved to be quite annoying. She seemed so 'poor me' every time she would talk about all the things she never had. Movie Lindy had a troubled family life too, but she didn't come across as Book Lindy did. Overall it was a decent read. It was fun to see the similarities between it and Beauty and the Beast. But for the first time ever, I'm going to have to say I enjoyed the movie more than the book, this time.",Kayla (Shattered Memories Reviews)
9781416971771,"You guys I'm kind of sad, no, that's not the proper word - distraught. This series is over like really over as in this was the last book and there will be no more in the story and I don't know what to do with myself because it feels like this series and I were running to catch a train and it made it but I didn't and now I'm stuck on the platform watching it move away and I'm never going to see it again. Yes, I am being dramatic but you must have read a series that completely blew your mind and then ended because all series must, you have to remember how you felt when you read the last page and it sunk in that that was the last, last page. This happened to me with other books on a less dramatic scale but there is one other series that has made me feel this way and that would have to be the Harry Potter books. Now, these two series are nothing a like story wise - Harry Potter was a contemporary fantasy about a boy who finds out he is a wizard and attends a school and discovers he's not only a wizard but famous. Leviathan is a steampunk/alternate history that takes place in the year 1914, and is told from the points of view of Aleksander, Prince of Austria, and Deryn Sharp a girl disguised as a boy in the Royal Air Service. On the other hand, what both books do have in common (at least for me) is that they are both set in fantastically created worlds filled with detail and brilliance, they both have great MCs and equally great minor characters that aren't just there to be props and they are both filled with many daring adventures. At the end of Behemoth Alek still didn't know that Deryn was a girl and Deryn knowing that Alek would never be with a commoner had made peace with herself and firmly decided that she would never tell Alek her true identity or her feelings for him. Alek, who's family tragedy started the war still firmly believes that he must end it especially after the successful revolution in Istanbul and with all these secrets and goals brewing the Leviathan continues its journey east. When the synopsis said ""around the world tour"" it really meant around the world. In Leviathan we got to travel through Austria, Switzerland and Britain, in Behemoth we were in Istanbul and in Goliath we traveled from Serbia to Japan to San Francisco, onwards through Mexico and finally New York City. I loved seeing how each country was familiar but changed because they were melded to fit in Westerfeld's Clanker vs. Darwinist world. Like a reporter with a recording frog perched on his shoulder, and video cameras that look like giant walking weapons from the distance. I also loved the name drops sprinkled throughout the story like Mikimoto - who works with fabricated pearls or Ford who has plans to make transportation walkers. These weren't the aspects that had me glued to the pages however because a story is nothing without the protagonists and I have to say Alek and Deryn never disappoint. Deryn is finding it a lot harder to keep her secret and the more risk she takes the more danger she is in of being found out. Still who would Deryn be if she wasn't the first person to zip down a line or strap on a glider and although her actions are never done deliberately to put her in the spot light its impossible not to notice someone so brilliant. Alek is finally learning what kind of person he is and who he wants to be, the plan from the very beginning was to hide away and ride the war out but Alek knows he'll never be content with staying still especially when there is a war and every person seems to be doing whatever they can to fight it or fight in it. While this isn't a romance series (thank goodness) the romance or should I say feelings in the series had been growing more and more steadily which each passing book and I beamed whenever Alek and Deryn were in scenes together. Not because there was mushiness going on but because these two best friends fit so well together. I just loved how easily they trusted each other with their secrets, and how one admired the other for their actions and who they were. There was never any long paragraphs of how hot one person looked or how one person made the other feel, everything was shown to the reader through the actions of the characters and never had to be jammed into my head. Understated love is what keeps me from rolling my eyes and actually feeling a tender moment for what its suppose to be - tender. Am I happy with the way this series ended? Yes, I was smiling because it was sweet and its the ending the characters deserved and its an ending that fits. Am I sad the series has ended? I think the first paragraph in this review answers that question.",Sandy

After her seventeenth birthday, Violet learns that she is part angel, which makes her Grigori. Lincoln is her destined partner to fight exiled angels. After Violet had already revealed her secrets to Lincoln, she felt highly betrayed by Lincoln that he would keep something so important from her. I really liked Lincoln and we don't get to see a lot of him, but seriously the guy is hot and being backed into a corner with no win-win situation seriously sucks. Especially when he does nearly whatever Violet asks of him. When a character shows up out of no where, I always have some a lot of initial distrust towards that character. From the beginning I expected Phoenix to do something. I did not plan on liking Phoenix, because he is manipulative. He can read and alter emotions, which he does sparingly to Violet. When Phoenix reads Violet's emotions, he tells her exactly what she needs to hear when she needs it most. For this reason there is no choosing of a team. I like both Lincoln and Phoenix. I'm not entirely convinced about the way things ended with Phoenix in the book. There's more to him than he is letting on. I'm seriously leaning towards Team Lincoln at this point though. We will have to see in Entice. Violet is a strong character, who wants nothing to do with the Grigori. The choice about everything was taken away from her, so she decides that she will not embrace. Even with Phoenix constantly reminding her that she is a walking neon sign for exiles and that embracing would be to her benefit. Despite the fact that Violet refuses to embrace, she gets thrust into the angel war. The war is only the beginning, sometimes it's impossible to outrun destiny. It's only a matter of who, what, when, and where. Not a matter of 'if.' Embrace was a fantastic read with a brilliantly woven love triangle, great characters, and a highly creative story.",Darla
9781442485280,"(Source: Purchased from Amazon.co.uk on kindle for only 99p!) This is the second book in the Vincent Brothers series - I haven't read the first one, but that didn't really seem to matter, the book can be read as a standalone. Lana is heading to her cousin's house for the summer. She's given herself a makeover, and all in the name of one person - Sawyer Vincent. Sawyer was her cousin Ash's boyfriend for 3 years, but they broke up 6 months ago when Ash dumped Sawyer for his brother Beau. Now Lana has decided that Sawyer has had enough time to get over Ash, and she's going to make her move. Sawyer thinks Lana looks hot when he meets her again after such a long time. He's not interested in a girlfriend, but a summer fling would be nice. Lana isn't interested in a summer fling though, she wants Sawyer 100% or not at all. Can Lana get Sawyer interested? Is Sawyer really over Ash? And can Lana and Sawyer ever be more than a summer fling? I'd heard loads of good things about this book, so when I spotted it for only 99p on kindle I had to have it! The story was nice, if a little cliche, but the best thing about this book was the romance and heat between Lana and Sawyer. Lana and Sawyer together were simply hot! There was no actual sex, but boy did they create some heat between them! I disliked how Sawyer treated Lana at times, he totally ignored her in favour of doing something for Ash, and never told her that all he wanted was a fling, even when he knew that wasn't what she wanted. It really did take a massive kick up the backside to get him to admit his real feelings. I liked the storyline, although like I say it was a bit cliche at times - lots of misunderstandings and jumping to conclusions going on. The way that Lana hid at times also put a bit of a dampener on things, because not much can happen when your two main characters have absolutely no contact. I did enjoy this book overall; purely for the heat between Lana and Sawyer! This was definitely a book that kept me up reading instead of going to sleep! 8 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780373210862,"If I could count the books I've read that actually had realistic events, events about everyday life, and heartbreaking moments between family, friends, and lovers. They can be counted with both my hands. Yes, I tend to stay away from books that show you how life is for some people because well, I read to escape reality and to dive into fantasy and the supernatural. Because I know they're not real and they rarely remind me of how hard life is for other people. So, I took a chance and read Pushing the Limits, which is about Echo who almost lost her life to her mentally ill mother and Noah who is thrown into the foster system that separated him and his brothers when his parents past away in a fire. Honestly, it's refreshing to read something new once in a while, though this is still teen. But it's a book with depth and raw emotion. It's not really teenage angst caused by petty things like a break-up with a week relationship. But real depression caused by memory loss, death, and posttraumatic stress disorder. I loved the main characters, they were easy to like and form an attachment to. Then there are the antagonists they have in their normal lives, which were their parents, the foster system, teachers, etc. The best thing about this book was that it was captivating. No matter how many times I had to put it down because of work or the need to sleep. I just couldn't and the facts that held touchy topics like a bi-polar parent, death in the family, the foster system, mental illnesses and many other themes. I absolutely loved the writing style; it was clean, crisp and had a perfect balance of detail and dialogue. The parts of the books that really touched me, was the scenes between Noah and his brothers. They were separated by the foster system and Noah wants nothing more than to take back his brothers from their foster parents before they force his brothers to forget about him. If I was separated from my younger and older sibling, I wouldn't know what to do. Overall, I loved the book. It was a Contemporary Romances that really stood out amongst hundreds that were released in 2012. It is heart-wrenching and beautiful.",Najla Qamber
9780330537896,"I had read some good reviews for this book so I decided to try it for myself. This is the first book in Gabrielle Zevin's Birthright trilogy. The story is set in a future world that has many restrictions on basic things that we take for granted, I have to admit that I struggled to imagine chocolate ever being an illegal product! Anya, along with her brother and sister, had been through a lot in their short lives thanks to their connection to New York's criminal underworld. Anya tried to take charge of any bad situations because she was fiercely protective of her family and I loved this side of her. She seemed to switch between being a tough character who thought she could take on the world, to a sensitive catholic girl who needed as much help and guidance as she could get. Reading about the time Anya spent in Liberty children's facility was uncomfortable, knowing that she didn't deserve any of it made it even more difficult to read. I liked the relationship between Anya and Win, it didn't happen instantly like many other books that I have read (not that don't like that kind of instant attraction, it just wouldn't have been right for these characters), instead their relationship progressed over a period of time. This book was written as though Anya was talking to you, the reader, and I really enjoyed this style of writing. Towards the end Anya had some very difficult decisions to make and I wasn't really surprised at what she decided to do. The end itself left so many possible scenarios for the next book rushing around in my mind. An intriguing tale of forbidden love and family loyalty, I can't wait to see what is in store for Anya in the next book.",Kate Verrier
9780330537896,"Gabrielle Zevin has strongly wrote about loyalty and it comes across to the reader as being an extremely important, if not the main, part of the book. I really admire how Zevin has included this in the book because I think this detail is what makes the book what it is. It's about a Mafia family but there isn't a lot of Mafia business involved in the book, which is good because otherwise it may have taken over. Instead Zevin has concentrated on portraying one girls problems and responsibilities. Anya is the heroine of the book, and I also admire how Zevin has characterised this character. She is basically the head of the family, so she has to be strong and brave for everyone else, while inside she's still a 16 year old girl who has had to become mature quickly over the years. Her boldness has to be envied. Also do not fret if you are thinking Anya is like all the other girls books, because she is not, she's unique and worth reading about.

There might still be the need to talk about Maggie and Caleb's feelings and the events of the past, but sometimes their conversations just felt like a revision of the LEAVING PARADISE talk. Now Maggie and Caleb are forced to spend a four week trip together to talk about their experiences with drunk driving. Time to sort out their differences one could think, but to me it felt like Maggie and Caleb seem to be stuck in their old dialogues and actions. It's not like in LEAVING PARADISE where they made progress by approaching the other. In RETURN TO PARADISE they are caught in a silly loop and unnecessary frictions, pushing the other away and letting him get close again. New about this part of their story is that they join four other teens on their trip. They are Matt, Erin, Trish and Lenny. These teens have stories of their own, that are definitely worth hearing. Thanks to them and their refreshing personalities RETURN TO PARADISE doesn't feel like a total dragging read. My favourite character in this novel might be Lenny with his ridiculously funny actions and jokes. I didn't really need a sequel after LEAVING PARADISE, but I'd already got it and so I made myself read it. There are some things that could have been solved faster. In the end I was content that the story came to a decent end. THE VERDICT RETURN TO PARADISE - A decent but unnecessary sequel. RETURN TO PARADISE promises more talk about the accident and its consequences, luckily with a few funny and fresh character cast additions.",MissPageTurner

In the end, the only way to make their relationship stronger is for Caleb to return to Paradise, where he will ultimately resolve the issues surrounding the accident, including those dealing with his family.

9781408835197,"Wow, this book man. I couldn't stop reading it! Seriously, I was sitting sloth like in a nest of duvet, crisp packets, desperately wishing my lucozade bottle would just fill itself back up already. Time Travel, multiple narrators and flashbacks are three things that most authors struggle to use effectively and I usually end up just bewildered but Cristin manages all three and I kept up with every new character, every plot twist. I'm really impressed! The main characters, Em and Marina are two very different personalities and at the start it felt a little odd, going from Em in a dank cell to Marina, in a cosy bedroom, talking about boys. I instantly connected with Em as I love a fighter chick but took a few chapters to really start to like Marina. Then there's Finn and James - Finn made me laugh in the very first chapter, so I basically sold my soul to him at that very moment. James, not so much as I found him quite shallow and cold but that's not really expected as you'll see when you read the book yourself. Every character is well formed and have their own personalities, no cardboard cut-outs. Again, I find myself being very impressed and stuff. Getting technical with the wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. It was perf. Seriously. Everything was explained from how it came about in the first place to how one even does the thing and paradoxes and side effects and if I could kiss this author on the cheek right now I would do because there was just so much thought that went into this that made it so much more... more. I do have one teeny tiny itsy bitsy problem with the book. Actually not the book because my problem is that there's... dun dun duuuuuuun... a sequel. There story is completely wrapped up by the end of the book, everything sorted out and there is absolutely zero reason to even bother with a sequel. Unless you know, you're trying to get more money or something. But publishers wouldn't do that to us would they.",Vickie Ramage
9781408835197,"All Our Yesterdays is a time travel novel that accepts the idiocy of time travel storylines and uses it to it's advantage. Unlike most time travel stories, where they go back to change the past and the paradox of that idea is not confronted, this novel tackles it head on. That is something I applauded this novel for, however it's not without it's flaws. All Our Yesterdays took a long time for me to get into, I was about 30% through it before I was actually intrigued instead of just confused about why I should care. The problem with this book is that it starts off with two completely conflicting timelines, one of Em who is an experience hardened young women living in a cell, listening to the man she loves (Finn) being tortured through the wall, and the other timeline is of Marina who is a young privileged teenage girl struggling with the fact that she's in love with her best friend James. The two timelines juxtaposed themselves in an uncomfortable way. The pacing was also off for the first 30%; where Em's timeline was fast and tense Marina's was slow, almost painfully so by comparison. Once the novel finally reached a point where the two timelines were in synch I actually started to enjoy it and I started to care a lot more about the characters in it. Finn and Em I especially loved, like everyone else who has read this novel. Their love story did not distract form the story, but instead acted like a cushion of warmth between the hard, hurtful things that they had to struggle with. I figured out the link between the two timelines before it was brought up but that only made watching Em and Finn's story unfold more beautiful, because you could tell that Finn always loved Em. A lot of the things in the novel were confusing and not everything was explained, like for example how did Em and Finn's past selves get the note in the drain? Also I'm not entirely convinced by Terrill's attempt at trying to provide an explanation for the paradox of changing time, but I am happy she acknowledges their is a problem with these kinds of stories and attempted to come up with a solution so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. Overall I enjoyed this novel once I got through the hard parts so I've given it 4/5 for that. More reviews are available at www(dot)where-is-wallis(dot)blogspot(dot)com",Iona

Making a bad grade or not fitting in. God, I was scared of you. And it was all such a waste. None of it matters now that the real scary **** is here."" About The Book: Present Day: Em is locked in a bare cell, alone and with Finn next door, the only person that makes her want to still be alive and not give up. Because If she gives up, not only she's dead, but Finn, too. Back then, she have hated him. Always in the middle, always putting Em on edge. But back then, she was different and so was he, but he kept making Em smile and laugh despite their horrible future. The Doctor is only keeping them alive with the intention of finding something from Em, torturing her and Finn until he finds the thing that Em stole from him. Four Years Ago: Meet Marina, Finn and James. All friends. Maria is in love with James, James is keeping a secret and Finn is in love with Marina. Everything goes down when Nate, James' brother, is shot. Nothing makes sense any more and James is willing to change the fact that his brother, and only family left, might die. Four Years Ago: Finn and Em arrive four years ago, when the world was still okay and wasn't suffering from the Doctor's and Cassandra's actions. This is the fifteenth time they travel in time through Cassandra to prevent James from building it. This time there's no other way: they have to kill him. There's no other way, because If they don't do it, there would be no time for love in the future world, no time for freedom and there'd only be one power: time travel would make its owner rule the world. When the uncertain future and the encouraging future collide, trouble, chaos and murder is allowed. The time is clicking and the future is in Em and Finn's hands. The only thing they need to do is kill a person to save the future. But what happens when the person you have to kill is the person you love? Review: This summer I read a lot of time travel novels and this one was one of my favorites. Always in constant movement and with a mission, this book is full of magic, a little bit of science, romance and the idea of having a better future. Cristin Terrill theory of time travel is a good one and the way she explains it in the book makes you believe that its real, that maybe today you will find a paradox of yourself around the corner. She creates this machine that would make possible the time travel, Cassandra. She also presents time not as a linear thing, and that this creates paradoxes and the possibility of creating chaos If a past version of you sees the future version of you. What I liked the most? The paradoxes. How Cristin ""freezes"" some scenes in the book and justifies it as time trying to prevent changes in the past. At least, some important changes. And that the natural course needs to be restored and that means that time tries to erase paradoxes (aka Em and Finn). I loved how she takes advantage of that scenes, where time tries to ""catch"" the paradoxes, and makes the main characters from the future (Finn and Em) revive some events from their past, like vivid memories that feel real, almost like its happening at that moment. I really liked her theory and her idea and I was truly impressed to the point of falling madly in love with it. And what makes this book a great story is that you not only experience a lot of emotions while reading the book, but you're not bored and you're always in tension, feeling the anxiety of the future characters always with a mission and trying to save the world. I remember that the first feeling I had when I finished the book was sadness. I felt sad for everything. For how an ambitious man can cause a damage so enormous to the world and arrive to a point to loose himself, to even hurt the people he loved the most just to have power. I was also sad for him, for The Doctor, because I knew, deep down, he didn't want to be bad and he yearned for an approval from the people he loved. And, finally, I felt sad for Finn and Em, their situation and the ending. At this point I was heartbroken. But my first thought was: ""It must be really exhausting and must tear you apart, psychologically speaking, saving the world"". ""I'm suddenly very scared. Not of the explosion, which defies my comprehension, but of what I'll have to do when it's all over. Of what all this is for. You have to kill him."" Another thing that makes this book so interesting is the fact that, at first you don't know everything. You know that two of the main characters are imprisoned in a cell, not knowing exactly what for. You also know another character named The Doctor, aka the bad guy, who keeps them locked down and tortures them in order to find something Em stole from him. And when they use Cassandra for the ""first"" time in the story everything starts to make sense, slowly. You start to receive the information along with the event that keep happening four years ago, in Marina, Finn and James' time. You know that the Finn from four years ago is the past version of the Finn who tries to safe the future, but there's no Em's past version. Or so we think at first. You also don't know where's the James' future version and why he's not with the two main characters. It's like you're part of an action movie and they are all keeping a secret and when you start to approach the end, you start to visualize the whole plot, the whole story and the secret the author was ""keeping"" from you. And that would blow your mind. The exciting thing about All Our Yesterdays, as I mentioned before, is that you're lost. You don't really know what is going to happen and most of the things are so unexpected that you are always gasping and trying to predict the next move. Although when the author gives you more and more information, you start to guess some things and the astonishment and the twists are even bigger than you thought it would be. With the main characters, Cristin Terrill, makes sure that there's a huge change between the future version and the past version. While the past version of the main characters are genuine and happy, the future version have lived a terrible live and seen horrible things and what seemed like the most simple things, like pancakes or a Christmas, is the most beautiful thing they see in a long, long time. It's almost really sad knowing the anxieties and desires of the future versions. Em is a fighter. Strong and almost a wild version of her old self. She's willing to do whatever it takes to prevent the horrible future she's from and she's willing to give her old self a second chance in life. Although If that means that she would disappear. Marina is what you could call a na?????????????????????????C/?????????C/??????C/????????-ve version of Em. I wanted to slap her and hug her at the same time. She's so blind with James that it makes me want to shake her until she comes to her senses. She has an awesome guy next to her, always attentive and hoping that she sees him like she sees James, that it made me want to cry. And why I felt sad? Because she doesn't realize what her future is and that James is not interested in her. He might care about her, but I knew from the first instant that he didn't love her. I was hoping that she would realize who really was there for her and who really loved her. Finn is what bring the idea of true and pure love to the story. He has a great heart. Not only his future version, the tortured one that even in the darkest days he tries to keep smiling and making Em smile, but also his past version. I am madly in love with him and not only because I imagine him super, super hot and super, super cute and good person, but because he always tries to make Em smile and his old self is always helping his mom and being a responsible guy. (*sigh*). Yes, ladies, I fell in love. And what makes him the ideal boyfriend? He's always thinking of Em's feelings. Sweet, I know. Even If that means breaking his own heart. (*double sigh*). ""He sighs, ""I just wish I could see you."" I scoot closer to the wall, until I'm pressed against it, and I spread my fingers against the concrete blocks like it's him I'm touching. It's foolish, and I'm glad he can't see it, but it makes me feel a little better. ""Me too."" ""Remember when you used to hate me?"" I laugh-sniff-hiccup. ""Well, you used to be insufferable."" ""I think incorrigible is a better word."""" The Doctor is the great representation of what ambition, power and some ideals might do to a man who once was a good boy with a shy and geeky character. He kills in cold blood and thinks that everything is fair in the game he's playing. He's going to be important and he's going to do great things. He'd safe a lot of people by killing a thousand or a hundred, but he thinks that that's what you could call ""collateral damage"". James is the good, shy and geeky boy. The usual next boy with a high IQ and with a lot of ideas and visions for the future. I was really sad to see that he was keeping his ambition in secret and that he is willing to pursue his ideas and dreams even when people tell him that he's going to rip the world apart. I felt also sad when I discovered that, deep down, he was still an innocent boy who didn't want to be like The Doctor and that this innocence makes him still believe that he has the chance to be a good person and do things right. I was kind of crying at the end of the book and didn't want to read it. However I didn't expect anything different from it. It was almost like destiny. The ending was perfect, and a little bit mysterious. I am definitely waiting for the second book in the Cassandra Chronicles and hope to see a happy, happy, happy (yes, three happy) ending. Book Addicts, we are giving this wonderful and fantastic world a five gorjuss dolls because you know now that we are madly in love with it and that we not only liked it, but absolutely adore it. We are waiting for the second book and this anxious feeling is only left but an incredible story and a must read book. So listen to us, Book Addicts, and give a chance to All Our Yesterdays.

9781408835197,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Bloomsbury Publishing Plc (UK & ANZ) and Netgalley.) 20-year-old Em is imprisoned in a cell with a drain in the middle. In the cell next door is a boy - Finn. Em and Finn don't know much, but they know what they need to do - escape from their cells, go back in time four years, and kill him. Four-year-earlier - 16-year-old Marina is in love with the boy next door - James. They've always been best friends, but she needs to tell him how she really feels now. That is if someone doesn't try to kill James and his brother first, and Marina and Finn don't end up in harm's way too. Who must Em and Finn kill? Why must 'he' die? And can this story ever have a happy ending? I really enjoyed this story, I loved the mystery of how things had turned out the way they had, and how Em and Finn would change both the present and the future. Em was a girl on a mission, even if completing the mission would kill her both emotionally and literally. I loved trying to work out the relationship between Em and Marina, and how their lives would overlap, and I loved doing the same with the other 'future' characters Finn, 'him', and 'the doctor', and the 'present' characters - Finn, James, Nate etc.. It was obvious who Finn was in both times, but not obvious who the others were, and it was a bit of a mystery as to who was who. As the story progressed we slowly became aware of who was who, and why for the fourteenth (yes fourteenth) time of coming back in time to try and change things, Em knew that she had to kill 'him'. I liked the storyline in this book, although the talk of paradoxes and stuff in this one was pretty confusing, as it was explained that time ironed out paradoxes, and something about a shadow always making sure the important thing happened or something?! Confusing to say the least so I ended up ignoring that bit mostly just so that I could enjoy the story. I liked the idea that Em had a list of different things that she'd tried previously to try and change things, and I liked that she had difficulty doing what she knew that she had to do. I liked the very slight romance going on between Em and Finn, although strangely the person I felt most sorry for was James (I'm not telling you why 'cause that might spoil things!). Things ended in this book in possibly the best way, although it wasn't really what I was expecting. While things turned out mostly positively though, I couldn't help but feel really emotional at the end too, as I felt that the best thing for the masses was not necessarily the best thing to a small number of people, who had to sacrifice a lot to keep everyone else safe. The ending of this one actually left me close to tears, and I still feel sad over the way things ended. I really wish that things could have ended differently, even though fourteen other Em's couldn't achieve a better solution. Overall; an enjoyable time-travel story, with an emotional storyline. 7.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781408835197,"Cristin Terrill's first novel is nothing if not ambitious. We have space-time manipulation, paradoxical concepts, assassination attempts, and the complications of multiple timelines. There is romance, a distant war, the ties of friendship, and everything in between. It all begins with a drain, a time machine and a list. In a very real present, Em and Finn are neighbours in a secret prison, their cells lying adjacent to each other. In another real present, Marina Marchetti lives next door to James Shaw, her best friend and a genius. Linking them together is Cassandra, the impossible time machine and, for Em, the very thing responsible for her imprisonment. On a list hidden in a drain is a record of instructions, all but one of them crossed out, and all of them in Em's handwriting. The final instruction is meant for Em. The storytelling here alternates between Marina and Em, between a set of characters oblivious to the implications of time travel and a set of characters who know about the consequences all too well. It's a fast-paced ride from start to finish, and a surprisingly emotional one too. Although All Our Yesterdays feels predominantly plot-driven (as might be expected), the characters are not forgotten in place of the technicalities of the storyline. The relationships between Marina, James and Finn, Em and Finn, and Em and a certain doctor are all very skilfully built and manipulated along the course of the book. The friendships are believable, the romance even more so. Although Marina's character is initially portrayed as a frustrating clich??????????Â©ï¸, it's clear after a while that Terrill knows exactly what she is doing. Every flaw and habit is subtly explained, and every character arc is more than plausible. The scientific concepts require slightly more flexibility and an open mind (it's time travel, after all - some creative license will undoubtedly have to be used), but the vast majority of it is reasonable and well-presented. The mind-numbing complexities of space-time alteration are aptly dealt with, with just enough logic and substance to satisfy, yet simple enough to work for all. Terrill acknowledges and addresses the grey areas that appear, namely in the form of paradoxes and the re-writing of history, and ensures that plot holes are kept to an absolute minimum. Remember when The Tenth Doctor told us that time is non-linear and more like a big ball of wibbly wobbly, time-y wimey stuff? That's essentially all we need to know here, which I'm sure will come as a relief to many, but the detail is also just about present too, for those who want it. Not that it is majorly necessary at all, but I would have personally liked just a little bit more. We are briefly introduced to an unknown variable, a possible sentient element that eliminates threats to time by fixing events in place. Some further elaboration here, instead of just a flitting mention or two, could have given it some added authenticity. Additionally, the progression of events (over just four years, really) feels somewhat far-fetched in retrospection, particularly given the scale of the changes. This isn't a terribly pressing flaw, however. The bulk of the tale is invigorating enough to make up for the brief moments of lapse. With little opportunity to pause and reflect, and far better areas demanding all attention, most flaws feel largely insignificant. In short, and despite the slight room for improvement, Cristin Terrill's mind-bending thriller is intense, clever and achingly romantic. For me, this is time-travel as it should be - exciting and completely unpredictable (even if not technically flawless). With mentions of a sequel currently in the works, I certainly look forward to seeing what Terrill has in store for us next. In the meantime, I won't hesitate to declare her debut novel a definite must-read.",Sam

9781416913184,"Well-known for her first novel, REALITY CHICK, Lauren Barnholdt has a new offering worth checking out. TWO-WAY STREET is the perfect book if you are interested in learning about both sides in a couple's breakup. Courtney and Jordan are about to begin a three day trip from their homes in Florida to their college orientation in Boston. Usually this would be cause for excitement, but this trip is bound to be uncomfortable. The reason is because, two weeks ago, Jordan broke up with Courtney, supposedly because he met a girl on MySpace. Since the plans for the trip have already been made, Courtney's parents are insisting that she stick with those plans and travel with her ex all the way to Boston. The characters and details of this novel are well-developed. Courtney is ultra-organized, schedule-oriented, and germaphobic. Jordan is a relaxed, take-things-as-they-come, rap lover. The story reveals their quirky best friends who are always just a cell phone call away waiting to offer whatever support their own busy lives allow. The private lives of Jordan and Courtney's parents offer their own unique brand of suspense to the plot. In addition, an underlying thread of the plot involves continued references to the use of MySpace, which is sure to be an attention-grabber for teen readers. Barnholdt created the book with alternating chapters. In Jordan's chapters he tells his version of the story before, during, and after the trip, and Courtney does the same in her chapters. This unique style allows readers to sort of ""read between the lines"" of the breakup. The characters are dealing with secrets they feel must not be revealed. The resulting tension and hard feelings created by the secrets will have readers rooting first for Jordan and then for Courtney.",TeensReadToo
9780142409411,"I have a confession to make. I have never particularly cared for Lewis Carroll's (aka the Reverend Charles Dodgson's) ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. Although I've read those stories, once, they have never even come close to being one of my favorites. With Frank Beddor's THE LOOKING GLASS WARS, however, I can easily say that I was drawn into the story from the first page--and have found a new book to add to my list of favorites. THE LOOKING GLASS WARS begins in 1863, in Oxford England, with eleven-year-old Alyss Heart having told her story to the Rev. Charles Dodgson over a matter of months. After four years of living in this world, Alyss is sure her story is about to be told. Unfortunately, the ""liberties"" that college scholar Dodgson took with her telling of her life in Wonderland have been turned into a parody, a fictional tale that resembles nothing like the life she had previously led. The events that led to her living in England have become nothing but a foolish story, something to be read to privileged children by their pampered parents. Alyss's story actually begins long before that day she is given a bound copy of ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND by Dodgson. While Alyss was celebrating her seventh birthday in Wonderland, plans were being put into action to overthrow the Queen, Genevieve, Alyss's mother. Genevieve's evil sister, Redd, has grown tired of being exiled from Wonderland--and her powers have grown strong. She stages a coup that begins with the death of the King, Genevieve's husband, Nolan. And it doesn't end until Genevieve is dead, as well, and Alyss is forced to escape through the Pool of Tears. This is only the beginning of Alyss's toils, and the troubles and woes that come to all Wonderlanders who refuse to recognize the new queen. As the other houses (Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs) take sides, as battles are waged, Wonderland fades from the beautiful, prosperous city that it once was. And Alyss, who was destined to be Queen, is forced to live a life of lies in an alternate world. Frank Beddor has come up with a wonderful story that draws upon Lewis Carroll's original characters and turns them around to bring them to vivid life. From the Chessboard Desert to the bodyguard Hatter Madigan, from the scholar Bibwit Harte to the young Dodge Anders, from the Generals Doppel and Ganger to The Cat and the Glass Eyes and The Cut, it's all there, in wonderful, splendid glory. This is definitely one story that will stay with you, and have you turning pages long into the night.

As number four, John knows he's next. Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages. With the sequel, THE POWER OF SIX, releasing in August 2011, only read I AM NUMBER FOUR if you are willing to become addicted to another series.",TeensReadToo
9780061969553,"I've heard people say that a great writer will make his/her readers feel something when reading their work; be it love or hate for the story itself, the characters as people, etc...if it wasn't great work those strong emotions wouldn't come out. After reading I Am Number Four, I can only say that Pittacus Lore is a great writer. I experienced all sorts of emotions and feelings while reading this book and I must say that after finishing it I wanted to have a nice little chat with Lore. After everything I was put through, the ending! Oh my gosh, I'm not going to give anything away, but Lore....you're killing me with that kind of ending. I've always loved the paranormal/fantasy genres but never really got into science fiction of any kind, what can I say...aliens never really appealed to me. X-Files wasn't my thing, Sigourney Weaver was great in Aliens but I don't have it on my shelf and let's face it, normally aliens are not dream worthy or likely to make you go weak in the knees after you get a look at them, unless it's from fear. But that was all before I read I Am Number Four. Wow, did I do a 360 and change my mind quickly. John Smith (a.k.a. Number Four) is an alien and all around wonderful and unique character created by Lore. He's been running his entire life just trying to stay alive and ahead of the creatures out to kill him. With only his guardian Henri as his constant companion, life has been lonely for John. Never staying in one place long enough to make friends, he's never really been able to get close to anyone, at least not until Henri and John move to a small town in Ohio. In Ohio a lot changes, John is able to make friends and of course a few enemies (always happens to the new kid in school), information is unfolded and discoveries are made that begin to help John understand more of what his life is really all about. Lore unfolded this story piece by calculated piece and he hit the nail on the proverbial head each and every time. I don't want to infringe on that but I intend to read more of the Lorien Legacy series in the future and more of Lore's work in general. With amazing writing that brought tears to my eyes (thanks a lot Lore!) and laughter as well, Lore will have you wanting to read more, more, more. He's already got me on his science fiction band wagon and I'm sure when you read this one, you'll be his next victim....readers don't stand a chance!",Katelyn
9781408320723,"I was so excited to finally get my hands on a copy of Anna Dressed in Blood after reading mostly rave reviews about it from American readers. I'm glad to say that this didn't disappoint and I can see it becoming a very popular young adult book over here when it is released here in the UK! This is the start of a trilogy that is certainly going to appeal to a lot of paranormal fans. Anna Dressed in Blood is a fantastic YA debut from Kendare Blake and it shows that she certainly has talent and a good imagination! The plot was an interesting one - we're introduced to Cas, a boy who finds it his duty to kill the dead. I found it a little confusing that he was killing murderous ghosts who were already dead, but it seems he was trying to get them to transition into another afterlife. Cas is always travelling, on a quest to avenge his father's death, and we meet him when he arrives at a new school. Whilst there, he meets a group of people who take him to the house where Anna, a girl who died in a blood soaked dress, haunts. From thereon in, the book is enthralling, captivating and rather gory! Personally, I loved all of the gory details and creepy situations. It was unsettling without being scary. This would certainly make a great book to read around Halloween! Anna was such an interesting character - As soon as she was mentioned, I want to know more about her and she still remains intriguing after I have heard the story of her death. I have a very vivid image of her in my mind - she is creepy, a pretty strong character and, well, haunting - I can't fully explain it, but my main point is that she's a very bold and interesting character. She seems complex and I'd love to read more about her. Unfortunately, I wasn't that taken by our other main character, Cas. He simply didn't interest me all that much - he paled in comparison to Anna. I did warm to him as the book went on though and I found his relationships with the other characters to be interesting. Cas and Anna's relationship progressed during the book at a reasonable rate - I was glad that Blake managed to create some gradual chemistry between both of them, though I do think it was still a little too fast. As for the other characters, I absolutely loved Thomas, a guy who befriends Cas and who has some psychic abilities. He was totally endearing and his interest in Carmel was adorable. Whilst Anna Dressed in Blood was for the most part very engaging, it wasn't perfect. The main reason why I liked this book was Anna, and she didn't always take the main stage. At some points, it felt as though Blake didn't really think of the bigger picture and just made the characters do what they wanted, even if it wasn't realistic and some things felt inconsistent. A lot of people will love the action, particularly at the end of the book, but I actually preferred the subtleties of the storytelling. Overall, I thought that this was a wonderfully gruesome book - I fell in love with Anna more than the storyline, but I can't wait to see what happens in the next instalment of this trilogy. It was great to read some really creepy, gritty YA and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the paranormal genre.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9780142401729,"To be completely frank. I expected so much from this book only to be disappointed. I expected a book with more depth and a better plot. Okay, so there wasn't much of a plot. I've read other books that were equally plotless but this one I didn't like much at all. It lacked everything I wanted in a contemporary, young adult book. And seriously. I just feel bad about it. After the 100th page I started feeling like the story, or an inkling of it was going down hill from there. This book is pretty much written for way younger readers below 14 years of age. And I'm hoping whoever read this below that age group were able to understand whatever morale Dessen has written it to give out. That Summer is Sarah Dessen's debut novel and I'm pretty sure she has gotten better over the years. Since everyone loves her books. I'm going to go ahead and pick up her latest book and have at it. In hopes that her books have more depth and a lot more fluff!",Najla Qamber
9780552564021,It is amazing. The suspense grabs your attention and the hilarious dialogue makes you cry with laughter. I recommend it to all young adults (11-13) and hope that they had as much fun reading it as I did.,Mickey Chow
9780007465231,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins and Netgalley.) This is the second book in the 'Partials Sequence' series, and kicks off 2 months after the end of book 1 'Partials'. **Warning - some unavoidable spoilers for book 1 - 'Partials'** It's two months since the events of book 1, Kira has escaped to Manhattan, New York, in hopes of discovering more information about not only RM, but the partials expiration date. Kira's friends meanwhile are still on Long Island, and things take a turn for the worst when Dr Morgan (the woman controlling one group of partials, who trapped and tried to experiment on Kira previously) leads a partial army onto Long Island in search of Kira. Marcus comes up with an idea that hinges on Nandita, which he puts into action, Haru has his own plans, and he goes off in search of a solution to the current war on Long Island, and the girls pretty much go into hiding to avoid being killed by the partials. Kira meanwhile makes some very significant discoveries in Manhattan that ultimately aid her in her quest for the cure to both RM and the expiration date. Can Kira find a cure for either of these problems? What does Dr Morgan want with her? And can humans and partials ever live in peace? I really enjoyed this book, it was full of twists and turns, and you never knew what was coming next! Kira is alone at the beginning of this book, and has made it her personal mission to find the cures for both RM and the expiration date. Her travels lead her to not only new information, but also to people, and her quest becomes more and more complicated. Despite this she keeps pushing on, and keeps going even in the face of certain death. It seems that nothing is going to stop Kira, and I think it's this unending faith of hers that she will find the cures that keeps her going. Kira's journey in this book is far from easy, and it really is a wonder how she keeps going at times. This book is certainly one that triggers emotions, but not necessarily the emotions you would expect! There were several moments that made me sad - certain deaths that I found upsetting, and probably an equal number of moments where I just couldn't believe what was happening! The twists and turns and mysteries constantly kept me guessing, and I'm not sure if this book has made me paranoid, but I constantly worried that Kira shouldn't be trusting certain people, or was making choices that were downright stupid and risky! This book was certainly one that kept me saying OMG, and worrying about what would happen next! This book did take me a long time to read though! Even though I had to stop 1/3 of the way in because of a challenge I was taking part in, the pace seemed pretty slow. The thing is though, even though the pace seemed slow, so much time was taken up with what Kira was thinking, and how these thoughts led her to her next discovery, that even the slowest parts had to be read thoroughly to be understood, purely due to the detail of the story. Be warned though; at 576 pages this is not a quick read! It's difficult to say much about the plot of this book without revealing too much or giving away spoilers, but I have to say that it wasn't what I was expecting, and the plot twists were tremendous. I have no doubt that the author is building up to an explosive finale following the ending of this book (quite a bit of a cliff-hanger I'm afraid), and I for one and quite happy to put in the time to find out what happens next! (I'm actually quite afraid to find out too though!) Overall; a harrowing journey at times, a complex storyline, war, unexpected deaths, and a multitude of twist and turns. If you like dystopian stories and aren't scared by the size of this book - go for it! 8 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781423106296,"We all know the story of Snow White; a beautiful princess, a wicked stepmother, a hunter and a poisoned apple. But what is the real story? Is Snow White really as innocent as all that, and is the Queen really that evil? Well yes, and yes. But what it not known is why... Snow White's stepmother, the Wicked Queen, was not always wicked; she was once young, and beautiful, and loving. But something had changed, she had changed, she traded her grief for vanity and once she started there was no going back. The Queen had suffered a lot during her life, and when she was at her lowest there he was, the man in the mirror. After that she was never the same again, and not even the gentle and beautiful stepdaughter could save her from herself, or the man in the magic mirror. This story takes you beyond the fairytale to tell the real story of the Wicked Queen, and how she became capable of the unspeakable act of attempting to murder a stepdaughter that she had once loved as her own. It is a beautifully presented book with a dark yet fun story that is full of insights. If you love fairytales or love dark fiction, you'll love this book.",Larissa McGrath
9780525421030,"So, yeah. I'm having serious trouble finding words for my experience while reading If I Stay. To offer you maybe at least some understanding to my slightly jumbled thoughts: I myself was in a car accident two and half years ago, which killed my cousin and one of his friends, while leaving me and the other friend merely slightly hurt. It was difficult to go through and that is probably one of the reasons while I have shied away from this book. It probably just hit too close to home. But then I just had to read it, too. Weird vicious circle, really. I bawled my eyes out while reading this. I had some troubles with the flashbacks because I generally don't like flashbacks (and I didn't here, either), but this story lives through the flashbacks. Even for an outsider - and in this case the reader is an outsider - it is unbelievably hard to get a grasp of what Mia has lost. Dealing with the loss of one relative at a time can be extremely challenging if not impossible. But losing your entire immediate family at once like that? Unbelievable. Even though the book treats a quite peculiar topic it is not all sad. The nice memories I experienced through Mia just show that her parents and her brother were such great and nice people and I forgot at times, that they were dead. That nothing could bring them back and that Mia would have to deal with that, if she decided to stay. Heartbreaking and teary. There are so many great things to say about this book, but seriously: Just read it yourself if you haven't yet. I'm kind of at a loss for words here. It was really, really good. It also made me want to go out and buy Where She Went but shops are already closed here so I'll have to wait until next week.",Jill Barrakling
9780525421030,"This is the first book in a long time that has seriously made me cry. A few have had my eyes tearing up a little, but this one had the tears flowing. The story is excellently written. The writing flows effortlessly, even with frequent transitions between past and current events. This book is filled with moments that make you laugh, smile or burst into tears. Very touching. In addition, I enjoyed reading about a teenager who took pleasure in spending time with her family and who really loved them. So many YA books make parents and siblings out to be the ??????C/?~bad guys' when that is not always the case. It was refreshing. The only downfall (if this counts as a downfall) is the story's length; it was over too soon! I definitely wanted the story to keep going, but at the same time the author ended it in just the right spot. A very moving book that I highly recommend; just make sure to have the tissues handy!",Scoot

After the accident, Willow is left an orphan, living with her brother, David, his wife, Cathy, and their daughter, Isabelle. Unable to deal with the intense grief, Willow finds her outlet in a razor. This secret tool helps her handle the pain and keep from being overwhelmed by the fact that she believes her brother no longer loves her and her parents will always be gone. However, a fellow student at her school, Guy, comes to learn her secret. He promises not to tell anyone else, but he can't walk away and believe she'll be fine. Instead, he stays and takes Willow's pain on, trying to understand and working to heal this girl he is beginning to love. WILLOW by Julia Hoban is an intense read, but it's not suffocating. Willow has her ups and downs, her problems, her fears. She's like every other person in the world, except her pain threatens to consume her whole if she doesn't get help. This book is about more than Willow's past, though. It's about her future and what will come of her newfound friendship with Guy. Two lives have been interconnected. Willow needs Guy, but Guy needs Willow, as well. They help each other, they open up to each other, they begin to trust and complete each other. WILLOW deals with painful topics, and can be hard to read at times, but it's also a very powerful story that is sure to resonate with most who pick it up.

9780061767623,"Little girls are definitely made of sugar and spice, as author Lauren Conrad proves in the third and final chapter of L.A. CANDY. The drama picks up again with the season two premiere of ""L.A. Candy,"" PopTV's most popular reality show. The show's main stars - Jane, Scarlett, Gaby, and Madison - are forced to smile for the cameras together as if they are best friends. As readers and show viewers understand, though, this is certainly not the case. Instead of trying to make the girls friends, show producer Trevor decides to use their disgust to his advantage to enhance ratings and plots. Jane and her coworker, Hannah, are forced to work with Madison at Fiona Chen Events. After the revealing of Madison's plot to destroy Jane's image in SWEET LITTLE LIES, the last thing Jane wants is to have to cooperate with Madison. Little to Madison's knowledge, though, her past and greediness are about to catch up to her when her blackmailer's identity is discovered. Scarlett is willing to work with PopTV and the show's producers more so than in the past books. She attends photo shoots and agrees to reunite with an old friend from high school, seeing as how her boyfriend, Liam, cannot be filmed. But is she really happy with her life choices and her decision to follow every PopTV command? Lastly, Gaby is always seen as ""L.A. Candy's"" most na???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????-ve and somewhat plain star. However, a new publicist and directions from Trevor unleash a new side of Gaby, much to the shock of her fellow co-stars. As you will find out in SUGAR AND SPICE, sometimes the lack of truth behind reality television can really hurt - and help those who are involved to learn about themselves along the way. The ending of L.A. CANDY is somewhat of a letdown after the amount of drama bursting within the novels, but, at the same time, it goes to show that reality television personalities are real people when all is said and done. I hope that Conrad continues writing, for she offers an intriguing inside glimpse at the lives of reality show participants that is often unseen in fiction.",TeensReadToo
9781471116889,"I wanted to read Deliverance because I have loved not only the beautiful covers but the story and world inside the book. The first and second books were fast paced and great reads for me and I def wanted to read the conclusion to this enjoyed series. I will admit that I didn't get into it right away because I didn't remember the details of what had happened in the first two books and my reviews didn't help much. I could recall Logan and Rachel as well as Willow, but the rest were a bit fuzzy. I really need a site that will tell me what happened in the first books of series since it is so long in between and maybe the beginning wouldn't have been so slow for me. I skimmed a bit especially with Logan's part because even though I know that I liked the romance with him and Rachel, I didn't remember his characteristics and he was under a lot of pressure and I think that those below him asking every two seconds if he has a plan got on my nerves a bit. Once it got to the Rachel story line, I got a little more into it, but I didn't remember the details about the trackers and what her deal was with her captors besides of course, that she was kidnapped. It is so hard when the kidnapped scenario happens in books though, because I am all about some steam and chemistry and of course you don't get as much of that when separated. But you do get a different kind of character development and I know that its a key element to so many stories. It was full of some really hard scenes, on the side of gory but so heartbreaking. Some of the characters are hard to like, but I appreciate how this one really looks at motivations and how similar pasts can be but just a few different choices along the way can shape future decisions and actions. On top of that the theme of forgiveness that Rachel learned while being captive and how important it can be even the simplest kindess can mean to someone else. The story tied up the plots and gave me satisfaction with reading, although I think that I would have liked it even more if there were more recap in the beginning, because there is no way that I had time to reread no matter how much I enjoy the series or books before it. Feeling lost and forgetting a bunch of the side characters as well as referenced past events that are seriously impacting the characters choices made me continue to be a bit lost and knowing that I was missing out on development and even more resolution than if I read back to back, had better memory retention, better recap, or a chance to reread. Bottom Line: Enjoyable, but forgot a lot and was a bit lost. Still loved Rachel and Logan and appreciated their ending.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

Meet Lillia. Good girl from a rich family who never had any problems dealing with boys who like her. However, this summer is not going to be an easy one. Thanks to her best friend she meets two quite boys who do not get a no for an answer and, then, her little sister is a rumor involving a friend of hers. There's no way she's going to let the same thing happen to her lil' sister like it happened to her. So revenge is a wonderful idea. Now meet Kat. Once upon a time she was friends with Princess Lillia and her best friend, Rennie. Now Rennie is making her life a living hell. However, she's willing to fight back and when the opportunity to make her pay for everything she did is in front of her face, she's more than willing to start savoring the consequences of a good revenge. At last, meet Mary. Poor, timid and cute Mary. She was a citizen of Jar Island before, until something happened and she left. But now is back and willing to make the boy who screwed her life ask for a huge apology or something else. She's not the same girl that left Jar Island and she's wants to prove it. Despite this, it seems that revenge is the only way she can feel even for the thing that boy did to her long ago. Three girls, three huge messes and one common purpose: sweet, sweet revenge. Because big girls don't cry, they get even. Review: This book is freaking awesome. Those TV show lovers, this book is where Revenge meets 90210 and Pretty Little Liars. But mostly, Revenge. We met three different girls and, of course, Jenny Han and Siobhan Vivian let us in the point of view of the three girls. Lillia could be described as the perfect good girl. Good grades, with a weatlhy family that loves her and with popular friends in her school. She pretty much can get any boy she wants with her innocence. On the other side we have Kat. Her mother died when she was still friends with Lillia and ::: and she's lived with her father and her brother since then. She's been raised in a house full of boys and she acts like a boy sometimes. She's a rocker inside and we totally love her! And then we have poor Mary. It's kind of an attachment to her name: poor. She was bullied in school, when she was little, just because she was fat. Now she is shy and tries to avoid attention. It's like she's a complete different person. Now she's not fat and she's still as beautiful as before, but the guy who is supposed to notice the change in her does not. This book is full of suspense and unraveling secrets. We couldn't imagine what was going to happen and while reading the book we totally realize that the world of each girl it's far from perfect. We feel bad for the three girls, but in different aspects. Princess Lillia, because that's what everybody calls her, it's suffering from a traumatic event with a university guy, thanks to Rennie. And thanks to Kat she discovers that her little sister is messing around with one of her best friends, Alex. The boy who is supposed to be in love with her, not because they are a couple or that he told her that he's in love with her, but just reading everything that boy does for her is pretty obvious. It's like the boy wears all the time a big shiny sign that sparkles with ""I love you, Lillia"" in his head. With Kat is totally different. We totally understand the bitterness she's keeping. Rennie is a bitch with her and it's normal that she yearns for revenge. Now she was some sort of dating Alex and discovering that he was with Lillia's sister when he called her that night is like stabbing her. Despite this and although she's glad that the person Lillia chooses for her revenge is ::: also was advantageous for her, she still feels something for him and still wants to impress him. Our advice? Girl! Get over him! He's not worth it! You just have to keep looking to the sign in his head! (The one we talked before, Book Addicts). And poor Mary is like a lost lamb in an ocean full of tigers. She lives with her creepy aunt in Island Jar and we couldn't quite decide if we like or not the aunt. The thing we couldn't understand either is why her parents can come to Jar Island. We love to know every dirty detail and it was kind of frustrating. We hated the guy (Not telling who it is, guys, but is one of the main characters. Just saying!) that bullied her and left her friendless and wanted to see him bleed and cry! (Well, maybe not bleed. But cry yes!). Sweet revenge. That's what each girl have. They decide a ""victim"" that deserve what they are going to get. But things get out of control at the end. In Mary's turn. And it left us with one dangerous and unnerving question: Who is really Mary? Burn for Burn is unlike anything we've read before. This isn't a sweet and romantic novel where everyone gets what they wanted at the end of the book, with the bad guys away or redeemed and the good ones with the prize. Nope, this is all about getting even. This is the true nature of revenge. The plot is all we were expecting from these two great authors: funny, entertaining, full of surprises and secrets and the uncharacteristic excitement on making you be on the edge; always wanting to know more! And what is the most interesting of it all, it's not only the three POV's of the story, but getting their stories from the beginning, but not all blurt out in the first pages. We think that's what makes you keep reading the book and then you're hooked! You just want to know more about the girls, the revenge, their plots and what is going to happen. Because, Book Addicts, a lot happens! Everything gets out of their hands and we're dying to read the second book! So, Book Addicts, don't hesitate! Not even a second!

Everyone can hear everyone's thoughts and there is no escape, even animals noise can be heard by people, but when Todd stumbles across an area of dead silence he soon finds out the town has a dark secret. A secret so terrible he must flee for his life along with his dog Manchee. I have to say I truly loved this book. I loved Todd's stubborn innocence, I loved Viola's strong silence, I loved Hildy and Manchee and all the other characters that helped Todd and despised those who sought to hurt him. Patrick Ness has this perfect and unique way of writing that captures every part of the world and characters he has created so perfectly without you feeling like the story isn't really be from the perspective of a 12 year old boy or that he has lost the detail trying to tell the story from the point of a child. It's a hard balance but somehow he does it brilliantly. What Todd knows you know, but only when it is important enough for him to think about it which starts the book off with a lot of unanswered questions. And for the most part of the book you feel just as confused as Todd, as well as everything else he feels. Information is slowly fed to you; not enough to be overwhelming, not enough to really satisfy you, but enough to keep you deeply enthralled. A testament to how much I enjoyed this book is that when I saw the sequel to it in W H Smiths I bought it straight away. That's right- I was even willing to pay full RRP for it, which I never do. I am a true Amazon and Book Depository whore. I can't really talk much about this book, so much in it happens and so often it changes your perspective that if I even go beyond the first few chapters I will spoil things for you and you really need to join Todd on his journey, but I will say this, this book has more twists than a snake and just because you know what a man is thinking doesn't mean you really know what is in his head.",Iona

Her prognosis is the best of anyone in the ward but all she can see how the cancer in her leg is taking her former life away from her. I liked how Betts broke up this book - the first part is entirely told from Zac's point of view, the last solely Mia, and the middle section alternating perspectives per chapter. The way it was told kept me rather anxiously reading on to make sure the characters were okay. Zac is someone I instantly enjoyed reading about. He's smart and funny - his bone marrow's alter ego, Helga! - but also incredibly logical. His fixation with maths and statistics showed that he knew his odds but was trying to be the one who beat them. Mia was harder to like - she's pricky and snarky but from reading her side of things you can see that it's just a cover for how scared she is. The relationship between them was a joy to read. They are unlikely friends but their shared experiences give them a bond that few can possibly understand. I love the interactions between them - from Mia obnoxiously blasting Lady Gaga to Zac's knowledge of the ridiculous ways people have died. This book despite the serious nature of cancer did leave me grinning at times. Their personal situations as well as their medical conditions contrasted nicely - Zac with the super supportive friends and family who all knew the ins and outs of what he was facing opposed to Mia who didn't even let her friends know. Zac considered Mia to be the luckiest person on the ward but she was the one acting as if she was the only person facing a death sentence. Zac has the family who are all there for each other and there maybe teasing on the farm but when it comes down to it they would do anything for one another. Mia isn't quite so lucky as her mother was a teenager when she had her and neither one seems to know how they should treat the other. These differences contrasted nicely and really showed off how differently people behave when facing a similar beast. I've seen people compare Zac and Mia to John Green's The Fault in Our Stars - with both books dealing with teens and cancer but for me they both told very different stories. Zac and Mia showed off the darker side - with everything from hair loss to bowel movements being discussed. I liked that Betts showed the ugly side of things as it made it all a little more realistic for me. It felt well researched from both a medical standpoint as well as the personal side of cancer. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It's thoughtful and heartbreaking yet sincere and at times amusing. I highly recommend it.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts

9780778304463,"Also reviewed at Paranormal Book Fan The book starts off with Meghan being held at the Winter Court by Queen Mab, having been brought there by Ash as part of their contract. After the scepter is stolen, Meghan and Ash escape. Puck comes back to bring Meghan home and Ash heads off on his own. The winter queen declares war on the summer fey believing them to have stolen the scepter. Meghan doesn't make it home just yet and sets off with Puck, Ironhorse and Grimalkin, to once again battle against the iron fey to save Nevernever. This was just as good, if not better, than The Iron King. I could not put it down. It was even more action packed, fast paced and emotional than the first book. And the ending was fantastic, made me so happy. We see a lot more of Puck in this book. I really like him but I'm still loving, loving, loving Ash. He is amazing. He stands up for love and doesn't care what happens. We see a different side to Ironhorse, seeing him as brave and sensitive rather than just the enemy. I was glad to see the return of Grimalkin, he had me laughing out loud at times with his sarcasm. I love the way he says ""I am a cat"" when asked how he does something. And of course, Meghan. She is a great protagonist. Her character has grown in leaps and bounds since the beginning of the series and I don't think she's done yet. I can't wait to see how much stronger she is going to become as she really gets a hold on her magic. She is definitely one of my favourite female characters. Julie's descriptions in this book were just as good as in The Iron King and even though there are a lot of characters, they are all so well written that there is no confusion. This book is very hard to review without spoilers so I will leave it there. Again, I would have no hesitation in recommending this book and will be putting it back on my shelf as a reread. Now, onwards and upwards to The Iron Queen!",Suzanne Finnegan
9780778304463,"My love for this series gets bigger and bigger every day :) I have to say I'm so glad it was chosen as BNC of the month last November otherwise I might of not read it until... well I don't know although maybe it wouldn't of taken my that long... but with all the new books coming out. Okay so of to the book. What can I say the Winter Court is awsome in it's evilness :) Meghan is captured in the Winter Court with no powers and completly alone, as her Winter Prince Ash, doesn't seem to like her anymore... (bad Ash ^^) Meghan tries to warn Queen Mab about the Iron Fey but she doesn't listen to her (not surprising really Queen Mab doesn't really listen to anyone) But when the Scepter of the Seasons is stolen it's up to Meghan, Ash, Puck and Grim to rescue it, with the help of other friends on the way. I have to admit I cried alot and the ending? Well the ending was perfect but heartbreaking. I've also finished The Iron Queen and Summer's Crossing so I'll post a review in a mo'.",Nathiel Gold
9780778304463,"It took me some time, but after I got into this series, I'm really enjoying it. I admit it, Meghan is annoying at times, naive at her best and simply stupid at her worst. And while a heroine can make or break a novel, in this case my dislike for the main character is not to bad. Why? Because it has ice prince Ash to make up for that! I truly adore him! Since he's so old, such a ravid love seems much more plausible, I think. And oh, what he did for him and Meghan at the end of this book, a little corny, maybe. But still, so romantic! What I had hoped would happen didn't happen, but that is okay because there is still hope that it will come to that in The Iron Queen, so I don't mind too much. I found the plot very cohesive, although at times it was a bit slow and there were a couple of chapters where I mostly read the dialogue and skipped the rest. Still, I could hardly put it down even in the heat that I'm currently forced to live in. I can't say that I loved every single page, but I did like the book as a whole, explaining the rating.",Jill Barrakling
9780778304463,"After a whole night reading the book (with my fiance sleeping in our bed and my doggy and I in the couch) all I can say is: AWESOME! Seriously, I wish I could create a new world for this book like Barney in HIMYM created ""possimpible"", hahahaha. Don't pay me to much attention, I'm sleepy. But yeah, I'm sure you want me talk about the book so here we go: At the end of the first book we saw Meghan saying good-bye to her family to go fulfill her promise to Ash: she is now in Winter Court and is Queen Mab's prisoner... Somehow she expected that by doing this she was going to see Ash more but turns out that they see each other only a few times and Ash is always cold and distant. Trying to forget Ash' behaviour she speaks with Queen Mab about the Iron Fey but it doesn't work, the Queen does not believe a word she says and when the Scepter of the Seasons is stolen the Queen vibrates with anger. And so the war between Summer and Winter Courts begin. Now is up to Meghan and her friends to recover the Scepter of the Seasons, if not the war with not only affect their world but the human world as well... The writing, once again, is wonderful. Julie, I believe, is a master creating and showing us the world she created. The way I could feel Meghan's difficult times trying to understand her feelings for Ash were touching and the way I laughed with Puck and Grimalkin have not price. Nothing more to say, I'm going to read ""The Iron Queen"" today. If by any chance you don't have the books yet please, I'm begging you here, buy them now!",Alaiel Kreuz
9781416974475,"I read the blurb for this book and thought it was interesting, so I picked it up. It took me a little while to start it, but once I did, I was hooked! It's a fast and easy read, though structured in a slightly different way than I've ever seen a book. It's written in segments with time stamp headings. It actually demonstrates the time that passes while she is trapped in a dream, as well as how long it takes her to recover. Frankly I didn't much pay attention to the headings; everything you really need to know is in the text. It starts out just following an ordinary girl who has a few extraordinary experiences, but then she falls into a dream where she's an active participant rather than just an observer, and things change. She finds an unlikely friend who becomes so much more, and finds a new way to go about her life and put her ""curse"" to good use, but it takes a heavy toll. Lisa McMann paints Janie in such a light that she seems like a normal teenager, and yet so different at the same time. Her relationships feel real, her plight totally believable, and you can't help but feel for her. The things she gets involved in and the ending are just ""holy crap"" worthy. Wake is a very different and unique young adult story that introduces you to a character you'll feel so invested in, you'll want to read the whole trilogy straight through back to back. It's a wild ride through the life and mind of a girl as she truly comes to terms with herself and her gift.",Hillary Curran
9781416974475,"""What did you dream about last night?"" ""Ohhhhh, I was in this very cool...""...many morning conversations start like this. Wake is about dreams, a daily and popular topic. The idea of a girl who has the ability to witness other people's dreams is creative and I expected the dreams to turn out as little appealing adventures that wouldn't let me sleep and dream myself. In the end I was disappointed to experience plain dreams being retold or co-dreamed instead. Interesting about Wake is that Janie feels a strange connection to a fellow student. This love story kept me going through the whole book, because love stories always tend to tantalize me and make me like the novel and characters even more. Janie and that special boy spend some time together and there are a few serious talking scenes, but there are also many rash actions and lack of character strength. Janie seems to be a character with some potential to touch the reader, she's got a troubled family background and a gift or curse that doesn't let her find sleep night after night. Unfortunately I couldn't connect to and care for her, she was just there. Wake is told from an omniscient narrator, which I think is the possible reason for my lack of connection. In addition the writing style is clipped and simple, whichI find not very captivating. A further negative aspect is Wake's number of pages, but this is just my opinion. I think Wake, Fade and Gone should have been published as one novel to create a more coherent and attractive book. Positive aspects about Wake are a few touching moments and some very important and intelligent motives that stand behind the overall storyline. THE VERDICT If you are interested in reading about Janie's special talent and the strange power that connects her to this particular boy you should pick Wake up. Still be careful, some dreams are not destined to be interrupted. Sleepy- thrilling? You decide!",MissPageTurner
9781416974475,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) I read this book at the beginning of this month (September). I have been trying to figure out what to say in my review. It has really made me think about the rating of it, because it's not really a three, or really completely a four. I really liked this book, but it wasn't my favorite. It was a little hard to get into and a little hard to read at times because the sentences were kind of choppy, but I got into it after a little while and got used to it. I really liked the idea of Janie being able to enter someone's dream, but I wouldn't want to live someone's nightmares! I want to read the next book in the series, but it's not at the top of my list. I feel bad for how Janie has had to grow up. Her mom isn't the best at all, she needs to get stuff together and start acting like a mother to Janie. She's an alcoholic. I'm glad she started making friends, plus maybe more, with Cabel. He seemed like a nice guy. Can't wait to see how much farther that goes in the next book. Overall, I'm sorry I don't really have much to say about this book, hopefully it will get a lot better in the second book. Which I will try and pick up soon. =) Also, I will be checking out more of McMann's books, I'd like to see how the rest of her writing style is. The cover fits the book well, but isn't one of my favorites.",Amanda
9781416974475,"Dreams can usually be categorized as our source of entertainment while we are sleeping. Although we sometimes may not remember them, they often take us on a journey that we may (or may not) want to happen. For Janie Hannagan, though, dreams are her worst nightmares. Not like any other normal teenage girl, Janie witnesses the dreams that anyone within close proximity is dreaming. Of course, she doesn't really want this to happen, but it has been going on ever since she was eight. Janie is able to see the ordinary dreams, from falling to drowning to going to work without wearing any pants. Along with that, she is able to see people's secrets and what they desire the most. There is nothing Janie can do about this but to just keep the knowledge to herself. That all changes when Cable, the guy who everyone thought was a pothead and a dealer, enters her life as she enters his dreams. Half the time, the dreams are somewhat sweet and romantic, but then other times she witnesses the nightmares that have been haunting him. As Janie tries to sort out not only his dreams but her own feelings for Cable, she learns that the only way to survive her reactions towards other people's dreams is to control them -- and to help the people complete the tasks that they so desperately want to accomplish. Every now and then a novel gets published and becomes a work of art that we all will long remember. WAKE is one of those novels that is not only unique but also mesmerizing and exhilarating. With her debut novel, Lisa McMann creates something that will be on our minds and change the way we think about what we read.",TeensReadToo

9780374346676,"Quick Blurb: What began as a simple English class project to write one letter to a dead person turned into something much greater for Laurel. She fills an entires notebook of letters to famous dead people, sharing her story in an attempt to find closure and acceptance in her sister??????C/??s death. It??????C/??s a coming-of-age story of heartbreaking reflection, leading up to a point where Laurel can finally move on and be her own person. The story covers Laurel??????C/??s freshman year of high school, effortlessly weaving together the lives of the deceased famous people, her memories, and her present life. My Thoughts: This is such a wonderful debut novel. It??????C/??s one of the best YA contemporaries to be published in the past few years. The story is beautiful, mixing elements of Stephen Chbosky??????C/??s style of writing in The Perks of Being a Wallflower with some of the darker subjects matter covered in Laurie Halse Anderson??????C/??s books. Laurel??????C/??s voice carried the story throughout. Dellaira gets inside the head of this damaged teenager to capture the emotional struggles of Laurel. Because Laurel has unfortunately had to deal with much more than someone her age should ever have to deal with, her voice become detached throughout parts of the story. It??????C/??s so effective. The reader experiences these moments of detachment with her, when it becomes just too heartbreaking. But in other parts of the story, Laurel is magnificently reflective, showing that even teenagers can be profound and mature. The side characters in this book also bring so much to the story. They all have distinct personalities and perspectives in share. The main side characters each get their own full plot arc, which makes them that much more three-dimensional and relatable. The letter format of the book allows for Dellaira to incorporate the lives of these dead people into Laurel??????C/??s healing process. For being such a moving book, the language and wording remains simple throughout, allowing the reader to devour the story with ease. This book will definitely leave a certain pang in your stomach, making you think about the effects your life has on the people closest to you, in life and in death. You should definitely pick up this book, particularly if you enjoy Stephen Chbosky??????C/??s The Perks of Being a Wallflower. This story will not disappoint! I??????C/??m adding Ava Dellaira to my list of new authors to keep a watch on.",Ryann Dannelly
9780374346676,"Like many readers, Love Letters To The Dead's cover really drew me in. It's absolutely gorgeous. I've been reading a lot more contemporary YA lately and the unique idea of having the story set out in a series of letters to dead celebrities really appealed to the weirder side of me, so I made sure I read it as soon as possible. The opening 20% or so was really good with poetic writing and an interesting storyline. Laurel's sister has died and her mother has moved to California, leaving Laurel and her Dad to pick up the pieces. Laurel chooses to attend a school further away from her sister's old school, to avoid being 'that girl'. However, this doesn't work as Sky, a boy she spots the first day in the cafeteria, knew May and knew that Laurel was her sister. The she finds out that a teacher of hers knew May too. This book mostly focuses on Laurel trying to fit in with girls her age while dealing with a huge loss in her life and she uses the letters to cope and reflect on the events of the day. However, about 30% in it started getting quite dull and I started asking more questions. With a contemporary like this, certainly of the ones I've read, you only need about 200 - 250 pages. However this is dragged out to over 330 and it really dulled the story for me. I literally nearly fell asleep in a couple of places. The writing is poetic, sure, but that got old fast for me and felt forced, not the author's natural style. I'm not the author though so perhaps that is her style. I also was confused as to why so many different characters would all speak in this weird poetic style all time. The lovely unique aspect we have, the letter writing to celebrities that have died, actually started to downright piss me off. It's one thing writing to celebrities but the book really showed the celebrity culture and how we immerse ourselves in lives that are not ours. The main character makes lots of presumptions about the celebrities and how their lives must have been and it just felt... wrong to me. At one point, the most shocking part of the story for me, was the main character wondering if River Phoenix had been raped as a child. There's no proof of this and if I was his family I would be horrified (and would probably file a lawsuit or something). It just felt far too invasive. These were real people, not objects to pick and poke at like that. The more interesting storyline for me, that isn't mentioned in the description, is the lesbian (ish?) subplot. Hannah and Natalie, Laurel's friends, are clearly in love and they really struggle with that and trying to hide it from the school and relatives. I do wish this book had been from Natalie's point of view, I think it would have been a far more interesting read. I wasn't a fan of the ending either. I'm glad I read that far for the revelations and big reveals and such but that was also dragged out so that nearly every small storyline could be wrapped up with a pretty bow. If you like that sort of thing, great but it didn't feel right to be, to have everything happy and wonderful.",Vickie Ramage

En el distopico futuro de Chicago, Beatrice Prioir tiene dieciseis anos y ha llegado el momento de que ella escoge su faccion. Su familia es de Abnegacion, pero ella siente que ese no es su lugar. Pero dejar su faccion significa que mas nunca vera a su familia. Cuando finalmente decide cual es la faccion correcta para ella, nadie cree que pueda encajar. Beatrice, ahora llamada Tris, debe probar a todos que ella es fuerte y capaz de cualquier cosa...todo mientras guarda su mayor secreto, un secreto que le puede costar la vida. Beatrice es una chica bastante timida y triste, pero al decidir cambiar su vida y convertirse en Tris, ella pasa a ser fuerte y valiente, pero aun bastante asustadiza, especialmente del contacto humano. Cuando conoce a Cuatro, un chico que tal vez conosca su secreto, ella comienza a pensar que tal vez no es tan malo querer algo para ella misma. El mismo que Veronica Roth escribio es interesante, y su escritura me hizo leer el libro en solo dos dias. Las facciones, Verdad (los sinceros), Abnegaci?3n (los altruistas), Osad?a (los valientes), Cordialidad (los pac?ficos) y Erudici?3n (los inteligentes), son muy estrictas, y la gente que pertenece a ellas esta obligada a actuar como su facci?3n lo describe. Las facciones fueron creadas para mantener la paz entre los hombres, pero ??realmente ellos viven en completa paz, como dicen los lideres? ??Que hay de la gente que no quiere estar en una faccion? ??Que pasa si tu eres inteligente y pacifico y valiente? En verdad no quiero dar mas spoilers. Es importante que para que disfruten el libro descubran ustedes mismos lo que realmente ocurre entre las facciones.

9780312629175,"Reason for Reading: I enjoy reading fictional stories that involve death and imagine what the afterlife is like. I have my own unwavering religious beliefs but I can still enjoy the whimsy of what an author creates. I have not read any other books by Alyson Noel. This new series concerns Riley, who was killed with rest of her family, except her older sister, in a car accident. Riley has just made it over the bridge, is settling into life in Here & Now and is given her job. She is to be trained as a Soul Catcher, someone who brings reluctant ghosts over the bridge into the Here & Now where they belong. There is plenty of information given that Riley was one such ghost herself for some time and references are made of that time and her sister Ever, which one presumes is covered in the beginning of The Immortals series, from which this is a spin-off. Riley and her guide/teacher Bodhi do not get on very well causing a lot of friction between the two. Her first mission is to rid a castle in England of a ghost called The Radiant Boy who has been terrifying people who visit there for centuries while Riley and her attitude can't wait to go because this means she gets to go to the Earth plane again. A delightful story. A quick, easy read with fun characters and fun hauntings. Not scary at all but a bit intense and there is some time taken to be serious when discussing how people died, giving them dignity. Altogether a cute, but humorous story sure to please the middle grades with not much of a wait now till the second book comes out in March, 2011",Nicola Mansfield
9781905654741,"I have read a few reviews and thought, yep lets read it, it will just be another vampire story. Boy, how wrong I was. The whole take on vampire mythology was unique. I would never have associated vampires with fallen angels. Not only that, there are good and evil vampires. Ones that adhere to the vampire code and ones that want to rule the world, for want of better terminology. The story encompasses the rebirth/reincarnation of vampires (aka blue bloods) from a single drop of blood containing all their memories and DNA. Science versus myth with the use of IVF. The formation of true friendships and allegiances. The soul-mate principle (or is it?), the 'ick' factor with the idea that twins are bound by blood (you need to read it, I am not giving away spoilers). With a bit of murder/mystery thrown in to keep you on your toes :0) The female protagonist, Schyler, was so easy to relate to, on the surface an outsider that has the strength of character to deal with whatever is thrown her way. Luckily she has the perfect friend in Oliver, that covers her back and protects her when ever he can (but is that all there is too it?!!!!) I adored the addition of Bliss and Dylan to their group and could completely understand their friendship and alliegance. Unbelievably clever plot twists and turns that leave you reeling, the teasers are there for you to pick up on if you can ;) For someone that thought this was just going to be another vampire book, I absolutely loved it. As soon as I finished it, I had to order the rest of the series and pre-order the other books :) I am now sitting by my mailbox waiting to continue this thrilling series.",Emma Davies

9781471402449,"I'm always in the mood for a good horror story, and Say Her Name struck me as having a lot of potential. Unfortunately, the fear factor just wasn't there for me nor was the story particularly compelling. Reason to Read: 1. A new spin on an old legend: I really liked how James Dawson used the Bloody Mary legend (which most of us have heard one variant of or another) and then built on it. He used its notoriety to help develop his own story, and he added an explanation and back story to the myth. That's a really great way to use this legend and it was particularly effective because there was a reason for each included detail. Now, as much as I liked that there was an explanation for all the creepy events and scenes... it also kind of detracted from the scary factor for me. The problem is that when I pick up a horror book, I want to be scared at some point. And I truly didn't experience that with Say Her Name. That was the main reason for my disappointment. This book felt more like a mystery thriller to me than horror, because while parts of it are clearly disturbing it didn't quite reach the level of horror for me. And those scenes are rather brief. I probably could have enjoyed this book had I enjoyed the plot more than I did. The characters didn't feel fully developed to me, and nearly all of them came across as caricatures. They were stereotypical teenagers, and rather one-dimensional. ARC received from Penguin Canada for review; no other compensation was received.",Brenna Staats
9781408807415,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) Captivate was very...captivating! Just like it's previous novel, Need. Captivate picked up right where Need left off. I really love when a series does that. It pulls you in from page one and doesn't let you go until the ride is over. You get to know the characters a lot better in the second installment. Which I loved! I love all the characters, I can't really pick one that I don't like. Other than most of the evil pixies, obviously. Not only do you get to know the characters more from the first novel, but you meet a whole new character named Astley. I really liked him, but he really has me curious. I'm not sure if I really trust him yet, maybe we'll find out more about him in the next installment, Entice. I don't really know what else to say about this book, it's just one of those books you can't really explain. This book took me on a roller coaster of emotions. Like all good books should. ;) I really liked the new additions to the book as well, like Valhalla, and I can't wait to read more! I'll be picking up Entice soon to read! Hopefully when I go in to the library this week they'll have it! Overall, this book was amazing. I loved it. Not as much as I loved Need, but it's still a favorite!",Amanda
9781408807415,Captivate is another fantastic read! Again the cover and title link in with the story just like NEED. The characters are still the same but Zara has grown. She's alot more confident and can kick ass just as much as the were's and pixies which makes me love her ever more. In Captivate we are also introduced to a couple more characters which adds to the drama and love for this story! Within these characters we see a couple more mytholigcal creatures which could have made the story fall apart because of all the information but it didnt! The story has also developed because we see kindness from this race which questions the theory that all pixies are evil! Captivates pace was also just the same as NEED which i was impressed with because sometimes in series the story can drizzle out but not with Captivate! Overall Captivate was better then NEED! There's a combination of characters we already know and others that make you fall in love with the story all over again. However it was left on a cliffhanger which is annoying but only because i am totally hooked on this series! Im looking foreward to Entice!,Emmi
9780007267170,"A 'sort-of' sequel to Wicked Lovely. I loved the use of one of the peripheral characters from Wicked Lovely becoming the protagonist in this story. The story is slightly more frightening and darker than Wicked Lovely which is to be expected when dealing with not only the darker side of faeries but also the darker side of life. Melissa Marr's descriptive writing literally jumps off the page and brings vivid pictures to your imagination (again this is not good when you have a phobia of snakes and there is an in-depth description of the pet boa constrictor!) Wicked Lovely had well developed characters but Ink Exchange takes them a step further. Especially the two male protagonists, Keenan and Seth. However, I would have liked to have seen the same sort of development applied to the central female character from Wicked Lovely, Aislinn. I would have also liked information on the events surrounding Donia as she is only briefly mentioned in Ink Exchange, even though she is essential to the plot (I suppose there is only so much you can fit into a book and it leaves the reader wanting more). Although I do not personally have a tattoo (I am too much of a wimp) I can truly admire the artistic talent involved and this was well documented within the story. The idea of wanting an emotional abyss was very thought provoking, who hasn't wanted an escape from reality when things are tough, the idea of not feeling hurt, anger, pain, only happiness sounds very appealing in principle. The ending was a big surprise, but I loved it. I adored the glossary of character names given at the back of the book, it really added an extra dimension to the plot. I wonder how long it will be before these names start showing up on the list of top ten baby names. For those of you who dismiss reading a Faery Story try the Wicked Lovely series and be surprised, these are faeries like you have never seen before. Highly Recommended.",Emma Davies

Roger is sent with her to supervise, drive, and hitch a ride to Philadelphia himself. They were old childhood playmates, but they hardly remembered each other. Amy is barely getting over her father's recent death, and Roger is dealing with the harsh break-up of someone he thought he loved. Needless to say, we are met with two needy and complex protagonists, and they give us one heck of a ride. What mainly follows is a series of detours. Amy and Roger decide to ride through Yellowstone, bypassing her mother's preplanned route; hotel reservations and MapQuest directions included. With caution thrown to the wind, we see these two characters change and build a relationship unlike any other. Amy deals with fears and her inability to be adventurous, as well as with a not-so-smooth mother/daughter relationship. Roger deals with trying to move on from a relationship that was never quite right, and with his new experiences with Amy. The writing and layout of this book was, in one word, perfect. It flowed and had the fun campy quality of Johnson's 13 LITTLE BLUE ENVELOPES and the depth of BECOMING CHLOE. Out of all the road trip novels I have read, this is so far the tops in terms of writing. The reader is also treated to the occasional email or music playlist. Though they don't show up constantly, but just enough to leave a lasting impact. Oh, and the rare receipt thrown in also had a lasting effect. Let me just say that this method ties into the ending in a way that left me utterly reeling with joy. Characterization and plot are no strangers to the power of this simple yet complex writing. Amy and Roger grow so slowly, yet exponentially, that the reader is left with a sense of completion upon finishing each chapter. The actions and growth are so subtle, yet hit the reader like the impact of an ocean wave on a tiny plastic boat. Even the side characters are perfect; their formations are great, and they don't ever feel like they are dropped, which is usually the case with novels like this. Even stationary novels have trouble with wrapping up characters, yet Matson does it with an ease and clarity that is appreciated greatly. Quotes begin every chapter section and fit together very well with the overall theme of the novel. This book is romantic and cute, but it manages to have several layers to it. The overall themes involving traveling and home and letting go are hit hard and in just the right spots to make the reader think without over-analyzing anything in the text. Even the references in theatre and song that dot the text have meaning aside from the obvious. A spot on the keeper shelf is nothing to this book. Really, I could give it a whole wall and it would not be enough. I loved everything about it; plot, writing, characters, themes...This book has it all. Even at hardcover, I would not hesitate to pick this book up. I would tell anyone to read it, just for the sweet romance and the idea of learning more about yourself and the people you know and love. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781416990659,"I had never read a road-trip novel before, only saw movies which I found quite boring. That's why the travelling part of the book surprised me positively. I found myself enjoying the ""little detour"" as much as the characters to the point that I'm beginning to think that such a road trip through the USA will be a good alternative for my vacation. The rest is just Amy and her grief. It's easy to figure out what her problem with driving is from the beginning and at some point it was annoying to see how she could open to other people but not to Roger. At the same time it felt liberating every time she got a step further, you could be happy for her and that felt right. I loved Roger - ex-girlfriend obsession included. He's cute and funny and cuddly. All the people they found in their journey made the book special, interesting and worth the reading. The book is about a girl recovering from her father's death, about how important it's to talk about what's troubling you and it's about grief and how overpowering it can be. A&R may not be the most romantic story I've ever read, but it's one of the most special ones.",papalbina

The first installment of The Twilight Saga starts off pretty slow, but continues on in becoming interesting as you go from chapter to chapter. Many have been ridiculing this Novel/Series, and from my perspective it may be because of the built-up hype and opposition of it's chosen character representatives. It's a young adult book that can pull the heart strings, a soft as well as humorous vampire-werewolf scenario, and a love triangle to add (or could it be a love-quad...i.e. Mike) I enjoyed this novel as I read it all the way through to the last book (Breaking Dawn).

What I am is a reader who is always looking to extend my knowledge base on interesting subjects, and this dinosaur encyclopedia fulfills that quest in spades! Everything you could ever want to know about dinosaurs -- all types, all genuses, all sizes and shapes and colors -- is detailed, extensively, within the pages of DINOSAURS. There are wonderful illustrations by Luis V. Rey, timelines, graphs, rock cycles, detailed drawings of skeletons -- you name it, and this book has it. With an appendix that includes a 48-page Dinosaur Genus List and a Glossary of hundreds of terms, this is pretty much the only encyclopedia on dinosaurs that you're ever going to need. I'm sure that some scientifically-minded people will yearn to find something that is missing, and they may even find it. But for the general dinosaur lover, this is definitely the book to add to your collection. Although the reading level is too advanced for younger children, those over the age of eight will find plenty to keep them interested and entertained.

Cassia learned new things about herself and her society. I enjoyed watching her progress.

Neferest has turned evil and is working with her consort Kalona while they take over the school and attempt to sway the council into continuing to go against Nyx. I am getting really sick of Zoey getting involved with so many boys. Eric. Heath. Stark. Loren. How many guys does the most powerful fledging really need? I really thought Heath would be out of the series by this book, but then blood is drunk, and she imprints, again! That is just too much. Eric is such a great guy and she's always messing it up. I really hope that throughout the series I can watch her mature and gain some perspective in her own life. Or maybe there is something to her being a man magnet whore that will come out in one of the future books. I really hope so, because it's quite pathetic that the new High Priestess has so many relationships with so many different guys. Even after everything Aphrodite has done for the nerd herd they still continue to bicker. I can understand it from Aphrodite since this is very much her character but she's also the one doing the good deeds and showing how she can overcome her differences. It still doesn't make sense why the twins are still so mean to her. Especially how much it seems Aphrodite really cares for the bunch, she goes into panic mode when any one of them is hurt. But then again if it weren't for all the inner drama with the fledglings I probably would have put the book down. The plot needs an adult character that is able to help them through tough situations an is on the right side. I think Darius and Lenobia are the two perfect characters for this position. I'm a little confused on how much time is passing by, when they are in the tunnels they talk as if they are down there for one night, but with all the activities that are going on it seems as if they had been down there for weeks. So much in so little time. It felt like they were down in the tunnels for so long, that it took up half the book and I was anxious for the climax of the face to face between Zoey and Neferest to finally happen. I've never seen Christopher Moore quoted in any other books, but the Cast team referred to him on 188 and it made me love the book just a bit more. By the end of the book, Zoey is complaining that Eric is too jealous. I was blown away by this statement, Eric has had to witness her drinking other guys blood, imprinting with other guys, having sex with other guys, and he's the one acting jealous? She should face the facts of her actions and stay away from a relationship with Eric because all she's doing is breaking his heart. So sad. Good news though, by the end of the book it seems Aphrodite and everyone seem to be finally getting along. I hope this means no more bickering in future books. www.stuffedshelves.com",elizabeth barbarick
9780312577995,"Honestly, I was eager to begin Hunted. With the end of the last installment in the series, things were left rocky, horrible, and confusing. So I couldn't wait to delve deeper into the next novel to find out exactly how Zoey and all the other fledglings would manage to get themselves out of this mess. I won't lie, the first couple of chapters were a little boring to me, but I was still hooked and could not quit reading chapter after chapter. I was very curious to see how all these fledglings would handle themselves, minus the aid of adult vampyres. It was very interesting to find that they had seemed to create their own little town, their own world beneath and there were honestly a couple parts that had my pulse racing a little faster and my brain begging to know what was going to happen next. I found myself really not wanting anything bad to happen to any of these characters. I do have to say though, that some of the situations Zoey is put it are getting a little exhausting. We're stuck getting aggravated at her and multiple male characters again as Zoey's boy trouble continue to be a problem in the world of the House of Night. I found myself begging her to just put some of these characters out of their misery and just (freaking) move on (already). Another thing I wasn't very happy about is the backtrack to previous novels. In Untamed, novel number four, it seems like most of the ""immature"" language and childish ways of speaking were mostly gone. Every now and then we caught a glimpse of Zoey's kiddish words, but it wasn't overly annoying. In this novel, Hunted, we're thrown right back into it. With words like ""bullpoopie"", it seems Zoey's refusal to use cuss words is thrown back into third grade. Even the characters in the novel constantly bring it up and terrorize her over it. (How many times do we need to read one character telling her it's okay to cuss sometimes?). The continuity of this gets a little tiresome. I also noticed that around the middle of the novel, there seemed to be quite a bit of typos and mistakes. Numerous times Darius' name was used when the character's were referring to Damien and Darius was nowhere near them. And there were a few punctuation errors too. Quotation marks that were put in the middle of paragraphs where characters had clearly not stopped speaking. I do not hold this against anyone though because I am the queen of the backspace button (I hit it four times in this sentence already). People make mistakes and sometimes there are just ridiculous typos that noone seems to notice until it's already too late. I go back numerous times after I have published a post to fix something that I never noticed until I threw it out there for the world to see. All in all, there was some repition in Hunted that I did not enjoy as much, but the novel itself was really good. I enjoyed it and would read it again. I have to repeat what I said about the last novel; the further you read into this series, the better the books get. And I absolutely loved the ending to this novel. I found it very touching and even went back and re-read parts of it.",Rainy Days and Pajamas

I am sad to say that her predicament has gone from bad to worse. Neferet, current High Priestess at the House of Night, has declared war on all human beings. To aid in her quest, Neferet has called forth an ancient evil that cannot be destroyed. Kalona, a fallen angel, has risen from the depths of the earth with Neferet's help. He is an immortal who believes that Zoey is his chosen one - the one who trapped him decades ago inside the confines of the earth. Zoey's task is great. She and her friends will be forced to use their abilities to help rid the world of Kalona once again, and sabotage Neferet's master plan. By calling the five elements, Zoey, Shaunee, Erin, Stevie Rae, and Damien are declaring a war of their own - to stop Neferet and Kalona, no matter the cost. The Cast duo has done it again! These ladies appear to be an unstoppable force within the world of YA literature. The energy and integrity of the first four novels has not been diminished in this fifth installment. The characters' personalities are as vibrant as ever, and the story remains engaging and original. Teenage readers will be drawn to Zoey's everyday, angst-riddled life. Not only does she need to save the world, Zoey needs to solve some major vampyre/human boy drama. These stories are surreal, yet shockingly accurate when it comes to teenagers and their lives.

I won't put this book as a read book of this month/year, because I didn't fully finish it. I read about two-hundred pages, but this book was a disappointment for me. I honestly expected way more than I got. First thing, I hated the beginning, because I didn't understand the characters because of all the swapping. It was exciting, but it doubted off. I wanted more, more feelings, more explanations,but this book was written too plain for my taste. This is a book that you either love or hate. A matter of what you like. If you like easy and straight to case written books, than this might be for you. It has a good story I have to admit, but I didn't connect with any of the characters, and I think that characters are truly important no matter what. I honestly thought that Max was a boy, because there weren't any distributions about it in the beginning, just me and I, and that might be confusing.

Their wings are the result of genetic engineering by a group of not very nice scientists at a place called 'the School'. At the start of the book they have already escaped the School and are trying to live life in secret - and that's where everything starts to go wrong. This book is a great start to James Patterson's first children series. While I wish I read it earlier (say at age 13 or so) Patterson's ability to create a page-turning thriller out of any storyline continues on in Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment. This book deals with child abuse, neglect, mutation and death. It questions the moral and ethical rights of doing what needs to be done to survive. It shows how smart children are when they need to be, when they are without parents, or an adult in general. It's not ridiculous though, no one is perfect and all of the characters in this book make mistakes, some that are one hundred percent regretted, others that would be done a thousand times over if needed. I really liked this book. It is the first James Patterson novel I have read but it makes me keen to check out his books targeted at the older generation. As I said before, I wish I had read it at an earlier age, when i could have related more to the characters (who sometimes have pretty childish moments) but I'm definitely going to read the rest of the series to find out how the story ends. Overall I'm giving Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment 3 and a 1/2 stars out of five.

9781607064077,"This is kind of an origin book, not for the evil school, but for our six characters. Each of them gets an issue which delves a little into their past. It does double the amount of questions that you have and makes the book seem much more fragmented than the first volume but you don't mind. This is definitely a brave book with the mystery increasing exponentially and flashing back (and maybe forward) in time so there is a lot to keep track of. There are some interesting decisions such as the importance of a cheerleading team in a school for psychopaths but on the whole you want to stick with it. It's the throwaway comments that really get your interest and make this feel like a very measured and controlled enigma. The art is just as good as the first volume and there are some very subtle changes to the style during flashbacks that works particularly well. The covers - which are gorgeous - have been included before each issue. As these are single issue tales this works but hopefully we will go back to the seamless story of the first volume next time.

9780930193355,"A rabbit Samurai. That is quite a large hurdle for many to overcome. It took me a while to pluck up the courage and finally dive in but I am sure glad I did. Like Blacksad or Animal Farm the animals aren't the focus of the story merely a conduit to convey solid ideas. By removing human dressing we aren't distracted by superficial details and can deal with what is important. These are traditional Samurai stories of honour, virtue, courage, and friendship retold in a modern way but illustrated with anthropomorphised animals instead of people. The names and places all sound genuine. The language is authentic, with explanations of the period terms, so readers who know nothing of medieval Japan will be able to both follow along with ease and learn something too. This isn't a Ninja Turtles cartoon this is a grown up allegory. After just a few pages you have accepted that your hero looks like a rabbit walking upright and he talks just like a sixteenth century warrior. The art is outstanding. It is black and white but the framing is pure cinema. The artist captures not only the rapid movement of a duelling samurai but a rabbit one too. There is real motion frozen in the figures and lots of simple but effective tricks to convey the dynamic flow of combat and danger. This is a book of separate tales that appear self-contained. When read together it acts as a giant road movie following the troubled life of our fluffy protagonist. You quickly grow fond of both him and the other recurring characters as you all experience victory and tragedy together. Without question, Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels

Although you get a feel for what the book is about by reading the back copy--in effect, that Regan's brother, Liam, is a woman trapped in a man's body--you don't get the full spectrum of what this actually means until you reach the end of chapter one. ""Rolling over, I muttered, 'You're such a freakshow.' Her hair splayed across my pillow, tickling my face. 'I know,' she murmured in my ear. 'But you love me, don't you?' Her lips grazed my cheek. I swatted her away. As I heard her slog across the floor toward my desk--where she'd unveiled her makeup caddy in all its glory--a sigh of resignation escaped my lips. Yeah, I loved her. I couldn't help it. She was my brother."" Liam is the type of boy who, even as a small child, wanted to by the Mommy when he and Regan played house. For his ninth birthday, he asked for a Prom Barbie and a bra. Now, as a senior in high school, Liam is consumed with letting out Luna, the name he's taken for his female self. His dad, of course, is adamant that his son will finally play baseball. His mother, lost in a world of uppers and downers, pretends not to notice when her son offers to fix dinner or do the laundry. And Regan, the only one who knows her brother for who he is--a sister named Luna--is losing sleep and a chance for her own life by hiding the secret. Something has to change, and it finally does when Luna decides to go all the way, to actually become Luna, the woman he knows he is. But what will it mean for his family, especially Regan, who has spent so long loving her brother, protecting his secrets, being a part of his life? It might just be time for Regan to have a childhood of her own, and for Luna to come out of the darkness, out of the shadow of the moon, and into the light. LUNA is an emotional, heartfelt read that deftly deals with the issue of transgenderism in a way that makes it believable and important.

We all wonder but Pierce knows. She died. And came back. If you are a fan of Greek Mythology then the place she went is the coolest of all: The Underworld. Oh yeah. And there she met with an old friend. A very old friend, one she met when her grandfather died and... he hadn't change at all. Weird. Never mind that, she was absolutely glad to find someone in a place where two lines of people - the one where she was in silence and the other line full of people trying to get to her line- were waiting for a boat to come... a boat to go where anyway?! So she did the only thing she thought could help: go and talk to him. But not all the things that shine are gold and her friend had a secret: ruler of the Underworld was his work and he just had, on purpose, made her lost her turn to go in the boat. Say what?! But she managed to run away from him and go back to live. She even thought that it had been a bad dream after the accident she had in the swimming-pool until she found in her hand the pendant he gave her to protect her. So yeah, it was no dream. And now, in a small island where her mother wanted to start new life for both of them (and where Pierce believed she wouldn't see him again) he was back. And she was afraid because every time their paths converged something bad happened to someone else. But deep down she knew that John wasn't that bad. And she was in danger, again, but not from him. Personal opinion: I'm a huge fan of Meg Cabot's books - for teenagers and for adults-. I believe her work is brilliant and when I read about this book my first thought was: ""Greek mythology + Meg Cabot = AWESOMENESS!"" and I wasn't wrong. The new modern twist is great, I'm really curious about John's work. You want me to tell you his work? Sorry, can't do, no spoilers here ;) But I can tell you that he is not Hades. But the plot of this book represents Hades and Persephone's myth. But yes, he is hot, he is awesome and he is dangerous. Really dangerous, specially if you try to harm Pierce. Add VERY protective to one of his qualities. And Pierce is nice. Maybe too much sometimes. And a bit clueless when it comes to help people. I mean, yes, she cares and she tries to help but sometimes she doesn't care if by heling someone else she gets in troubles... big troubles. What after a while turns to be a little bit annoying, but that's Pierce, right? You have to love her (or you can hate her, up to you, haha). The next book has to be great because the ending of this one was... bufff... let's just say that I kept pressing the buttons of my reader expecting new pages to, magically, appear and continue reading.

9780545284103,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) First off, again, this is Meg Cabot. I always know I'm going to like a book by her, because hello, she's awesome. This book didn't disappoint. I mean, I didn't like it AS much as I thought I would. But I still really liked it and I'm looking forward to it's sequel. When I realized this book was set in Florida, I was ecstatic. I live in Florida myself, but in the upper area of the state. My mother-in-law, however, lives in the Keys, where the story is set. Now I can't wait to go back down and visit her so I can go to the cemetery that Pierce goes to in the book. I didn't realize that Isla Huesos was Key West. I thought it was just some other island that was made up for the novel. I love the descriptions in this book. She get's the Florida weather right down to the tiniest detail. Especially with the humidity! About it being like soup when you walk out, yes, that is exactly how to describe it. I've always found it hard to describe it, but she has the perfect way. And I'm not going to lie, I will definitely be using that when someone asks me to describe the humidity here. Since this book was basically the set up for the rest of the trilogy, I didn't get into it right away. It was mostly told in flashbacks. Stuff that have already happened and she was just telling you about it. Giving you the back story. Which I am very thankful for. =) Towards the end I really got into it and that shows that the next book will be loads better. I love how this is kind of based on the myth of Hades and Persephone. Reading this really makes me want to go back and re-read the myth and go slower this time. I love mythology, so I'm really liking this new YA trend of mythological books. =) Overall, I really liked this book. You can never go wrong with Meg Cabot.

During that moment between life and death, she paid the Underworld a visit. From that she gained a sexy stalker named John protecting her from anything that may harm her. But what did I think of it? I am a HUGE Meg Cabot fan and I was expecting a lot out of this book. Unfortunately, I found the first half of the book was a bit slow at first, I felt as if I was forcing myself to read it whereas most books I read draw me in right from the beginning. After the first half of the book the addiction to reading Abandon started to grow, I started to take it everywhere I went! I found the characters very different, but a good different! They weren't your usual hopeless girl meets attractive boy, and that's why Pierce and John have been really interesting to read about. From how the book finished, I must say I am looking forward to the next book to coming out in 2012! Keep up the good work Meg!",Melissa
9780545284103,"After reading Princess diaries and the airhead trilogy by Meg Cabot, I really wanted to read this book because I loved her previous books and this one seemed to be for slightly older readers by looking at the cover. Meg Cabot's books which i read previously have a female main character and something that happens to her which makes the whole story (eg a simple teenager becoming a princess, two different girls change bodies and now - a girl comes back from the dead?). After reading this book I can say it is quite different to the previous books I read from Meg Cabot. The style of writing was very interesting to read and quite fast paced. I would recommend Abandon to many friends and I know they would like it, although the main character is a bit annoying sometimes when I read about her outlook on life :). I don't want to give out any details of the story, but I can say, I really want to read the next book in the series.",Agne Rimkute
9780545284103,"My personal opinion: About the author: For me she is one of the best writers of this era, I love all their stories, and how to narrate, I advise them everybody who wants to enjoy a good read at any time of year. About of Abandon: Not really even know where to start ... The synopsis, itself, is appealing from the beginning to end. Who does not love a good story that brings a little of everything: love, drama, some crazy hill, a villain, a character string crazier than sometimes living in their own world, and a main character who has more than demon angel? About of story: I loved the book from beginning to end, the only thing is that the story itself takes place in so few days that you spend reading very fast, and when you just think you missing data everywhere. I recommend it completely. It's an entertaining story, which just want to know more, know more data, it does not end. The author has treated the subject of death and life and the idea of the intermediate site, from where the souls, from a rational perspective, easy to understand and with which you can get into the role of actors and imagine. Explains the essentials of the situation without giving a theoretical roll, and also gets you interesting historical data on legends, stories, or as we like to call them.",Maria Solaz Izquierdo
9780545284103,"I was really excited to read this book. The whole re-adaption and inspiration of the Hades/Persephone story seemed incredibly intriguing and I couldn't wait to see what Cabot would do with it. To be honest, I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, there is a story there and I did enjoy it but I felt the way it was told drew it out out a little too much and then the flashbacks confused the issue more than it clarified. I found myself a little frustrated at the way each chapter was drawn out and would allude to what was to happen further on in such a way that it drew from the suspense rather than added to it. I also found myself a little fristrated with main character, Pierce, who seemed to vacillate between total cluelessness and knowing almost too much and found the revelations toward the end came just a little too easily. That being said, there was a definitely story there and I still found myself wanting to read to the end to see where it was going. This is the first book in a trilogy so it was clear Cabot was trying to set up the trilogy as well as tell a first instalment story. Despite the above, I did actually really quite enjoy the story and will continue to read the next instalment as I am still intrigued as to where it will go however the above did distract me a little from the story bring my rating of this book from from four to three stars. Definitely worth reading especially if you are not easily distracted by writing styles.",Nikk Karlovsky

Magpie is a fairy who is a devil catcher. Humans have been letting them out to plague the world. She is the only one who has the ability to make the glyphs to rid the world of these foul beings. She finds that a new devil, one who is different and scarier than the rest, has been let out, as well. She tracks him down in Dreamdark, the home of the fairies. His name is Blackbringer. He is going to destroy the whole world by unraveling the tapestry and swallowing the world into darkness and shadow. Through many adventures, Mags and her crows and a few other fairies wake up a Djinn, fight many frightful devils, and find out the true history of Dreamdark and the birth of Magpie. I was fascinated with the mythology that has been invented for this book. The world was dreamed by the powerful Djinns and there used to be many creatures in this world that have been hunted out of existence by humans. BLACKBRINGER was a delightful read full of roller-coaster adventures and surprises. I sure hope Laini Taylor writes more about Magpie, the crows, Poppy, Talon, and the Magruwen.",TeensReadToo

I read Fallen in 2011, but never moved on to read Torment. So this year I re-read Fallen and FINALLY dove into Torment. Though Torment wasn't as good as Fallen, it was still amazing and gave you a lot more history on things and Luce was able to find out a lot more about her past lives than she knew in the first book. Daniel, unfortunately, wasn't in it as much as I was hoping. Boo! BUT after starting the book and learning about the truce, he was in it more than I expected after all that. Which I was happy for. I love Daniel! I'm starting to like Cam again after all the crap at the end of Fallen, but I'm still team Daniel! I know a lot of people think that this series is a ""Been there, done that."" series. But I don't think so. Yes, some parts have been done before, but a lot of it is unique and extremely addicting. EXTREMELY. So much that I went ahead and ordered Passion and Rapture. You meet a lot of new characters in this book as well. Miles and Shelby, whom I absolutely ADORE! At times I was getting mad at Miles, since I'm team Daniel, but at other times I was all ""Awww..."" and falling under his spell. He's a great guy. =) Shelby is a great friend, at first I was a little annoyed by her, but as soon as she started opening up and being nice to Luce, I started really liking her. Overall, this is a great series. The writing and plot is addicting and the characters are well developed and you find yourself flipping through pages faster than you think you can even read. You go through so many emotions as well, at least I do. I'll be happy and then I'll be heart broken and it's just so emotional with Luce and Daniel and heart-wrenching at times and sometimes I really need a box of tissues sitting beside me when it involves them.",Amanda

9780060874308,"After a very long wait, readers will be able to find closure with the last book in one of Meg Cabot's hit series, 1-800-WHERE-R-YOU. Ms. Cabot begins the novel almost two years after the last book. Jessica Mastriana is now at Julliard after the long, tedious days she spent helping the U.S. government find the bad guys during war. Although it did help her country, the things she saw as she was overseas took a toll on her. Instead of being able to dream about missing people, now Jess only dreams about the horrible scenes she saw during the war. This ultimately leads to her losing her powers. But now that is all behind her. It's summer and Jess is living with her best friend, Ruth, along with Michael and Skip, and is helping to teach kids how to play a musical instrument. All Jess wants to do is to forget about the past and start over. Unfortunately, her plans are ruined when her ex-boyfriend Rob flies all the way to New York to see her. But it's not to ask her to get back together with her--more like Rob needs Jess to help him find his sister, who just went missing. Before she knows it, all the things that Jess wanted to forget come crashing back. But with her powers supposedly gone, how can she help Rob, the one person she especially wants to forget about? After the long wait, we expected for this series to end with a bang, and Ms. Cabot does not disappoint. MISSING YOU is the perfect ending to the 1-800-WHERE-R-YOU series, tying up all loose ends and resolving all problems, leaving the reader with no unanswered questions. Most characters return in the story, and even a surprise romance begins. Readers will root for Jess until the very end, while falling head-over-heels for Rob all over again.

9780330519502,"I am going to review this series altogether rather than book by book. The Mediator series is about Susannah Simon (Suze as she likes to be called), a sixteen year old girl who is a mediator, which means she can see and speak to the dead. She helps them with any unfinished business they have on earth so that they can pass on, and sometimes she has to kick ghost butt. The story starts with Suze moving from New York to California to live with her mother's new husband Andy and his three sons, David, Brad and Jake or as Suze calls them, Doc, Dopey and Sleepy. On arrival at her new house, she discovers that her bedroom is occupied by the ghost of Jesse, a hot guy who died about 150 years previous, around the age of 20. When she starts at her new school, she meets another mediator, the first one she's ever met, and they, with the help of Jesse, kick some ghost butt throughout the series. These books were a fantastic read. I really liked Meg's writing style. Suze was a great character, witty and sarcastic and she was accompanied here by many great characters, I liked them all, even the ones that weren't supposed to be liked lol. The first three books were enjoyable but I felt the series really took off from book 4. A new character is introduced and a kind of weird love triangle begins. The ending to this book was just perfect. It really finished up the series very well. I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone interested in paranormal romance. I LOVED it.",Suzanne Finnegan
9780330519502,"Sussanah Simon appears to be the typical teenager. But she's not. Actually, she's a mediator, gifted with the ability to see ghosts that are trapped and help them move on. But not all spirits want to do that, so, Susannah has to get tough. Then the whole situation gets even more complicated when a drop-dead-gorgeous ghost haunts her bedroom. And the adventure begins...! Meg Cabot is trully gifted with the ability to write!And her books are not only for teenagers, but can actually entertain readers of all ages! The best thing i really enjoyed with the Mediator series was that it was like you could actually hear Susannah talk, think, act, etc. It was like she was right next to you telling the story!The smart-ass remarks, the quick way of thinking, the typical teenager but the responsible adult at the same time! I was caught laughing all by myself so many times, that it started being ridiculous! But Sussanah rocks!! Cabot was able to create a character that you can relate to and actually admire!! The only disapointment was the fact that the Mediator series are completed in 6 books (or 3 volumes of 2 books each), when i sooo wanted some more of Susan and Jesse's story!Well, the good part is that on the whole, the Mediator series were very satisfying and purely addictive!!",amalia
9781847382894,"Written in 3rd person narrative but has the feeling of a first person narrative as it is mainly focalized from Nick's point of view. Really interesting and well developed plot. Clever plot teasers are placed throughout the story, although there is a major plot twist it does not come as a complete shock, all the indicators are there for you to pick up on. Fabulous Gothic imagery entwined with modern appliances/architecture. Very easy to have the movie version playing in your imagination while you read this. The snake imagery at the beginning made me cringe (how I hate snakes!). The description of the shadows brought to mind those in Fallen. I found it rather a strange coincidence that this book as well as Heavenly both state the evils of alcohol and how due to the lowering of inhibitions it is easier for evil to take hold and consume. The idea of being branded for demon possession is truly frightening, I did find it hard to believe that anyone would be stupid enough to let a demon into their bedroom in the middle of the night. The saying 'nothing is what it seems' kept running through my mind. The theme of nature versus nurture throughout the plot is similar to that running through Beastly but this takes it to a whole new dimension. The ending was surprisingly touching and tender. An action packed debut novel for urban fantasy fans. I think Sarah Rees Brennan is one to look out for in the future ;)",Emma Davies
9780007432271,"If you read my review of THE NAME OF THE STAR then it surely doesn't surprise you that I didn't want to wait a second to start its sequel right after turning the last page. From the beginning THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH sets a slightly different tone than THE NAME OF THE STAR. For instance this second part of Rory's story is not as gruesome and bloody as the Jack the Ripper muderer that had his claws terrifingly close around Rory's neck in the first book. With Rory uncovering the origin of new ghost occurrences around Wexford, a new kind of psychological tension slowly seeps into the story and through the cracks that once contained the restless patients of a psychiatric unit. Rory is a character that I could easily imagine being friends with. She's very independent, got a great sense of humour, keeps on babbling about funny things that come to her mind and she's got a strong intuition for what is right and wrong. I found myself enjoying and soaking up all the interesting little facts Rory researches in relation to the mysterious death in a bar near Wexford. The story wasn't as profoundly supported by such curious details as the first book's case which I guess has to be owed to the popular and widely discussed phenomenon that's immanent to Jack the Ripper. Rory's life has not nearly returned to normal and she's still trying to deal with her newfound gift, a gift she was left with after a Ripper imitating ghost failed to kill her. But the ghosts are as present as ever and suddenly Rory is of high interest for the group behind the ghost hunting unit of our friends Stephen, Callum and Boo. Facing new missions and mysteries around all kinds of ghosts, the four grow together and form an unbeatable team. I also really appreciated and savoured the time Maureen reserved for Rory and Stephen to get to know each other better and learn to love the little quirks about the other. I rooted for Stephen since the middle of THE NAME OF THE STAR and was hoping for Rory to fall for him, so you can imagine the grin on my face every time these two got some quiet investigative time together. Life would be too easy if we all could be just friends, so of course there is another group interested in Rory's talents. I wouldn't have minded if the story had countinued with ever new ghostly murder cases and no additional hostile group suddenly appearing and wanting Rory to join their cult. I thought THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH didn't house as many surprising turns as its predecessor and I mostly guessed what was going to happen until I came to the last thirty pages or so...and the final chapters became a major mood killer! I was so ecstatic one moment, and royally pissed the other! Readers will probably be wondering, how Maureen Johnson could let happen something like that. Right now I can't think of a statisfiable outcome or solution to what we all had to witness! At one point someone in THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH tells a story and Rory says that she feels like her absorption into the story was total. When she wrote this book Maureen Johnson surely knew that her stories had the very same effect on its readers. And as always the frequently asked question: Why do we have to wait another year for the next book in the series? 4,5/5 ****/* THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH ?C/?? A terrific and dazzling new shade of YA! The new crime cases of this sequel might not have fascinated me as much as the original Jack the Ripper murders of THE NAME OF THE STAR, still I couldn't resist the psychologically strong pull of this new SHADES OF LONDON. I fear this series will continue to have me in its killer grip. And doesn't the third book, THE SHADOW CABINET, sound too spooky and nightmarishly good to be true?",MissPageTurner
9780007432271,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperCollins Publishers and Netgalley.) This is book 2 in the 'Shades of London' series, and picks up a couple of months after the end of book 1. **Warning - some unavoidable spoilers for book 1 'The Name of The Star'** Following Rory's encounter with the 'Jack the Ripper' copycat in book 1, she's been recovering at her parents rented home in Bristol, and seeing a therapist 3 times a week, even though she can't tell her therapist what really happened in London. Rory's discovery that she seems to now be a human Terminus means that she knows she has to go back to London though, and she has to try and find Stephen, Boo and Callum and explain to them what has happened. Finding herself sent back to 'Wexford' Boarding School in London, Rory finds herself concentrating less on her studies, and more on finding the spook squad, and busting some more murderous ghosts. How long can Rory continue neglecting her studies though? Can Charlotte's strange therapist help her too? How long can the ghost busters continue without a working Terminus? And how does Rory feel about her possible future as part of their squad? This was a great sequel to 'The Name of The Star', I loved Rory, I loved the atmospheric nature of the story, and the ending was so sad it made me cry! Rory is quite damaged by her previous experiences in London, and it's taking her a while to work through things, especially seeing as she now has no one that she can confide in. She knows that she needs to go back to London, but it's more because she needs people she can talk to, rather than wanting to go back to school. It's really easy to relate to Rory in this respect, because she really is doing her best to recover from her trauma, and she seems to know better than anyone what she needs, even if it's not what everyone else thinks that she needs. It was good to go back to Wexford and catch up with all of Rory's old friends though, especially when she managed to get back in contact with Stephen, Boo, and Callum. It was obvious how much they all needed each other, and even though Rory wasn't ready to jump straight back into the job, she was able to focus on important things, and help when she was really needed. She even put extra effort into trying to solve a murder which wasn't necessarily unsolved, and kept an eye out for things resembling what happened during her own attack. There was a small hint of romance in this book, but it was very, very slight. The main storyline was concerned with Rory's recovery, and the new ghostly murders happening in London, and it flowed really well. I liked how it wasn't the same storyline rehashed, and I liked how all the characters had been changed by what had happened in book 1. The ending to this book was a big shock though! Something totally unexpected and sad and shocking happened which I really wasn't expecting, and it even made me cry! It's obvious that there will be another book after this one, but how Rory will recover from this newest tragedy remains to be seem, I can only assume that she will be even more damaged in the next book than she was in this one which is really sad. I really want to read the next book now though! Overall; a great ghostly/paranormal YA murder mystery. 8 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth

So, I finally decided that it was my next book to tackle and I didna??t regret it at all. There are so many reasons that I am in love with this book. All the way through the book you could sense that it was pure British; from the language Bourne had used to the way she spoke about college for Poppy and her friends. Ita??s not often that I come about a book that is based in Britain and catches my eye and this one was amazing. Lately in books, I have really been struggling to find one that finds a good balance between descriptive writing and speech and for me, Soulmates hit the hammer on the head with the balance. I was two chapters into the books and the description was beautiful, it was exactly the sort of thing that I have missed reading and that had to be one of the main things that made me hooked to the book. I loved the way everything was explained and how the writing just flowed. I was in love with Poppya??s dad from the moment that he was mentioned. The father-daughter relationship was really well wrote and you could see that he was the one that Poppy inherited a lot of her habits from and that they seemed to understand each other and the way they are. I love his attitude towards most things in life and how he looks out for Poppy but not in an over-bearing way. Even though Poppy and Noah were the main focus of the book, we got chapters where it was jumping to the people who knew what was going on between Poppy and Noah which I really enjoyed reading about because it gave you a little break from the main point of the story whilst still being about it. Anita and Rain were two people I really wanted to see more of and I really did get curious as to what was going to happen between those two. Anitaa??s story really made me want to read on and find out what happened to her. I love Poppy and Noaha??s relationship and how they ended up opening up to each other and grow with each other. It was really enjoyable to read. I did find Poppy slightly annoying though as she did seem to be slightly stereotypical as she was quite cynical about love and what was going on in the world. That was the only fault that I have with the book, as a character I found it hard to deal with her sometimes and the way she hated everything mainstream. Her character development happened pretty quickly for me, though that may have been intended when Noah came into her life, for me it just didna??t seem to sit well and was something that did bug me throughout the book. This book was amazing though and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a romance with a twist. It was completely worth the read and I cannot wait to get my hands on Holly Bournea??s next book.",Saira Ahmed

9780312650254,"This series is like a horrific car crash: you know you should just move on, but you can't help but stop and stare. The dialogue is atrocious, the pop culture references are abundant and cliche, the formula that each book follows is predictable and repetitive and the characters are annoyingly unbelievable. But, even knowing how bad they are, they are addictive. There's lots of drama and lots of suspense and that's what keeps me reading! Unlike the its predecessors, Destined is quite tame in terms of both drama and action scenes; when I think about it, not much actually happens. Zoey still hasn't learned to control her mouth, so Neferet is able to both discredit and humiliate her when she questions that Aurox is a gift from Nyx, the re-enrollment of the evil red fledglings does nothing but cause a few nasty words to be thrown around, and the employment of humans unsettles people temporarily, but is a minor blip in everyday activities. It actually seems like Destined is mostly a set-up for the events which will take place in future books as much is left unfinished: Lenobia's obvious connection with Travis (I'm thinking he is a reincarnation of the human she fell in love with which swore her off of humans for the rest of her existence), Shaunne and Erin's un-twinning, Shaunee's comment about watching Zoey and keeping her mind open and alert, Kalona's ability to enter Stark's conscious and Zoey's belief that Heath is a part of Aurox. I won't get in to how annoying Zoey's refusal to use real curse words is (bullpoop, really?), or how overdone Stevie Ray's Oklahoman accent comes across, or how often a label (I think they're shooting for an Apple endorsement - iPhone, iPad and Mac are all mentioned) or pop culture reference is dropped (at last count, I had 21 including True Blood and Game of Thrones) because it's the same issues that came up in previous House of Night novels. What I am going to comment on is Zoey's overuse of the phrase ""ah, hell"" which I'm almost positive was used to end almost every chapter, the creation of some really irritating words like ""ginormic"" and ""gihugic"", the incessant bickering which had me wanting to pull out my own teeth (because it would have been less painful) and the fact that there were ELEVEN different PoVs! All things which made me want to bash my head into a wall. Repeatedly. Per House of Night formula, the entire book is creating conditions whereby Zoey and her ""nerd herd"" + Aphrodite must band together to perform a circle and invoke the elements. Much of the book is preparation for this invocation, and its only during the last 50 pages or so that the action really begins. And then of course there's a shocking twist and we're left with a cliffhanger segue way for the next instalment. Oh joy. Destined (well, the whole series) does not deserve three stars. But there's a part of me that knows behind all the tackiness and bad writing, there's a really good, really entertaining story; there are moments of pure brilliance which remind me of the House of Night's potential . And unfortunately, I am drawn like a moth to the flame - I will keep reading this series. Shamefully. In a dark corner, where no one can see me.",Pretty Little Reader
9780061728921,"I was never a big fan of Sex and the City. It wasn't something that ever held my attention, though I have seen many episodes, reruns on tv late at night, and the movies, thanks to my mom (who fangirled over them a little). I wasn't even interested in reading The Carrie Diaries when it first came out a few years ago, but somehow I ended up hooked on the TV show that premiered on the CW a little while ago, and thought I'd give the books a chance. So I picked up a copy of The Carrie Diares at B&N last weekend. I figured since I loved the TV show, I would most likely love the book even more. I was wrong. The show was so different, and by different, I mean better. Or rather, I just liked the show better. I suppose if I hadn't seen the show before reading the book, I would have enjoyed the book more, but I was so frustrated with the characters being so different that it nearly ruined the book for me. It the show, Carrie is a bit... stronger, I guess. She was more confident in her writing abilities, her life, and was more put together. She wasn't as wild and immature, but in the book she was very immature. It was like I was reading about a completely different character, and I longed to read about the Carrie I saw in the show. Also, in the show, the main love interest, Sebastian, is awesome. Sure, he's a bit too confident and has that 'bad' thing going for him, but he's NICE. In the book, he's a jerk. Honestly, Sebastian was just awful. I could not bring myself to like him one bit and I kept waiting for him do something redeemable, but he just seemed to get worse. I feel terrible because most of my problems with the book are because I kept comparing the book to the show. As for the book itself, it was full of drama: girls fighting over boys, friends being crappy to each other, and things of that sort, which I didn't love, but it was entertaining. Carrie did grow throughout the book, so I'm hoping she'll be more like the character I thought she'd be in the sequel, which I ordered online from B&N two days ago. Anyway, if you're looking for something mature, and not filled to the rim with drama, this isn't the book for you. However, if you want to read something a bit silly, dramatic, and fun, I'd recommend you read The Carrie Diaries. If you're a fan of the show, keep in mind that the books are a bit different.",Jessica N.
9780061728921,"I was excited to read this book. I liked the tv show and was interested in knowing the young Carrie. In this book we meet Carrie when she's just seventeen years old. I definitely recognize Carrie. Even when she was younger, she had her unique personality and style. In this year, her life is starting to change, she is meeting new people, loosing friends, having boyfriends. Carrie haven't been very lucky in love. I guess it's normal being a teenager, you meet so many jerks. But then she mets Sebastian, the hot bad boy, and her world changes when he likes her too. It's this experience what I think marks Carrie more. She likes him so much, but at the same time he isn't too good for her. The part that I liked more was how Carrie found her writing. At this time, she's already writing, but with no success. She's insecure as most of the teenagers, but with everything that happens in this year of her life, she will found herself and her writing voice. Not only Carrie learns about her experiences, but also started to decide her future for herself; which is when the opportunity to go to New York arrives. The ending was what I was more excited about. I don't want to give spoilers, but if you are a fan of the tv show, you will probably like it. At the same time, I was expecting more from this book. I'm not sure what I wanted, but I got that feeling when reading it that was written more simple just because it was for young people. I'm not sure, I haven't read another book from this author. Overall, I was expecting more about this book. It left me disappointed, but I think I would like the next one more, called Summer in the city, and comes out August 8th, 2011. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a light reading and would like to know more about Carrie.",Maria Guajardo (GABY)
9780061728921,"This is actually my second time reading this book. (I enjoyed that much) Fans of Sex And The City will already know the inns and outs of Carrie, be it the books or TV show. This book is brilliant for answering the little questions you may have had before she moved to New York. Its also a great starting point for younger girls before going on to Sex And The City. Without trying to reveal too many spoilers, it was great to see a teenage girl turn down a boyfriend that pesters her for sex. The fact that she remained a virgin through the whole book even though her friends where ""doing it"" I think is brilliant, which is why i think Carrie is a great Role-model for young girls. She has a dream and sticks to it! I Think Candace Bushnell did a remarkable job with this book she got in all the school bitching and boys and still managed to keep Carrie level headed not a nutty teen! Its answers a lot of questions that fans of the show may have had. It also sheds some light on which of the girls she met first and how she came to meet them when she first arrives in New York.

9780062267146,"Dear lord, how could I have gone so long without reading this book? It was fantastic! It was emotional! It was utterly breathtaking! I have a sudden urge to listen to a certain two Beetle songs over, and over, and over again. This immediately reminded me of a YA version of Beautiful Disaster (which, is technically YA, but this is even younger I guess), but there are many significant differences. Jude, although filled with anger, is determined that he is not good for Lucy but is trying to walk the straight and narrow to be worthy of her. Oh man, I loved Jude from the first introduction-he made a good first impression and was very upfront. That beach scene was one for the ages and especially when Lucy holds her ground AND knows how to make a guy squirm. Now, Jude and Lucy basically begin to like each other within about a day and I thought that was rushing it, but some where in the plot I stopped caring about that and absolutely fell in love with these characters and their love story. And everything was SO intense. It caught of me off guard and it was extremely dramatic within the first couple of chapters. I was sitting around mouthing ""What?What?!"" and then crying, and doing some head shaking and deep breathing. But I wouldn't have changed a moment of this mad high-speed chase! I found myself missing the people they were at the beginning of the book just to be happy when I found them again. I was happy that Jude was trying to push away a girl that he believed was too good for him instead of wanting her around to help make him a better person, even when I was yelling at him that she could make him a better person...that they could make each other a better people. And then when he reveals things about his past and why he didn't deny these things when she accused him...well, my heart broke. And then there is the big climax!!! That I did not see coming and it was a blow to the face. I kept thinking ""Why? Why can they not have ONE happy moment?"" There were many things about this book that caught me off guard and made it entirely better. Some characters I thought I had down, just to completely throw me for the loop. Nicole Williams has definitely made an explosive and heart-wrenching story in her novel Crash; guaranteeing to provide you with a story and plot that the title Crash describes oh-so-well: mainly one hell of a ride. Good: Lucy-You gave him chances, and sometimes you didn't give him chances. You broke my heart with your kindness and made me smile with your determination to not let a man depict what you will become even when you felt like you soul was missing. I am happy that you were not one of those girls who was determined they couldn't live without someone even when you knew your life would never be the same. Jude-You're ridiculously hot as depicted by your reputation. However, it was you caring for Lucy, your determination to let her know what kind of a guy you were while trying to change, and even your anger management issues that stole my heart. I don't think I will ever see it again. Sawyer-your character made my head spun around Taylor-I kind of felt like you were a good person and you grew on me. Bad: Nothing that I can think of. Overall (Writing style, story line, and general): Even when there were moments when I was getting angry like when I couldn't understand why they couldn't have just one good moment I realized that was what makes this book so good, and those moments became good ones that took my breath away. The plot was fantastic and the characters both unique, and even when they could be filed away as the ""Bad Boy"" ended up creating new definitions for the types or creating a whole new type for themselves. I was captivated, and somehow emotionally invested in this novel.

9780451228864,"My Review In this book, I fell in love with it straight away. I was hooked from the very first chapter and I really didn't want to put it down until the end. The main character Lily Parker, has just moved from upstate New York, to St. Sophia's all girl boarding school. She ends up best friends with a spellbinder called Scout, but she has many evil run-ins with ""The brat pack"" who are constantly trying to annoy them. I thought the book was very well written and gave good detail the whole way through. The character Lily was very strong and brave and in a way I wish I could have her confidence. But the one that stole my heart was Sebastian, the bad boy. I don't know why people go for the bad boys but I just found I wanted more and more of Sebastian and Lily, so I hope that they get together at some point. I think Chloe did a fabulous job writing the characters, because you had a fair good amount that, not just involved the main characters, but the side lined ones as well. It gets shared around and I thought that was a rally important part of the book, to have a lot of scenes with others characters. After I read this book, I wanted to hear more of Lily's story and her journey, but I had to wait a while for the sequel to come out, which is just as good, if not better. I recommend this book to all people wanting to read Paranormal stuff and even people that don't because if they read this book they will be hooked into the Paranormal world for life. Outstanding!

The story-telling quality was good and I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. The character development was superb and as a reader, I can connect with Lily and Scout. Here is the kicker: Towards the end, the good guys team and the bad guys team had a drama talk which read like a badly scripted movie. The book is trying to make me believe that teenagers (raging hormones, emotions and all) would just stand around and watch newbie friend exchange info with the bad guys team leader in a high-stress rescue situation. WTF! In my experience, teenagers jumps feet first and bounce with energy. Specially with all that adrenaline pumping in their veins having to do a rescue stint. I therefore find these scenes inconsistent. And this is not the only ""inconsistent scenario"" in the book. So, ""suspension of disbelief"" would have to drop to zero. That scene there, needs a lot of work. It also tells me that this author has a lot of imagination but little true understanding of teenagers. From my point of view as a reader, if somebody wants to write about a subject matter, he/she needs to understand, or at least research it, because it'll show.

It is boarding school at its craziest and best. Even though it is set in South Africa, and I'm guessing that most of its readers will not have attended boarding school, teens everywhere will be able to relate to the trials and tribulations of main character John ""Spud"" Milton. Through Spud's diary, the reader gets to follow the antics of The Crazy Eight. Their wild adventures include the infamous ""night swims,"" porn magazines and videos, attempts to break the school farting record, and investigations into the mystery of the school's resident ghost. All their schemes and pranks are done at the risk of being caught by Headmaster Glockenshpeel, known as ""The Glock."" Spud not only deals with all craziness while at school, but he also deals with issues when he goes home during breaks. His father is a drunk who is sure the country is doomed now that Nelson Mandela has been released and Apartheid is over. Spud's mother puts up with his father's nonsense most days, but there are frequent, loud battles which sometimes end in her throwing him out. Add to all that a seriously senile grandmother Spud calls the Wombat. She has never-ending stories that, due to her declining mental abilities, she constantly repeats. Spud's father is seriously considering poison as a method for ridding them of his obnoxious mother-in-law. John van de Ruit's book is sure to be a success here in the U.S. His newfound fans will be happy to know he is at work on the further adventures of Spud and the gang.",TeensReadToo
9781408832066,"I'm writing this review on my MacBook Pro, whilst listening to music on iTunes. My iPhone sits beside me and my mum is currently using my iPad. I love Apple products and I use them everyday - in fact, I'd feel lost without them. Most of you will either own at least one of Apple's products, or know somebody who does. Even if you don't, you surely must've watched or heard of a Pixar film, such as Toy Story or Finding Nemo. It's pretty clear what sort of impact that Apple and Pixar have had on the world of technology today. I'm a huge fan of Apple, and as soon as I heard of the biography, entitled Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, I really wanted to pick it up and read all about the company. However, as much of a fan as I am, there was, to simply put it, no way that I was going to read a 600-750 page biography. The book is huge and I'm afraid that I just wouldn't have the patience to read it all - I was intimidated by it. When I was told by Bloomsbury that Karen Blumenthal had written a biography that was aimed at the 'iPhone texting, white-headphone-listening, iTunes downloading generation', I absolutely pounced at the chance to read it. At a much more digestible 320 pages (including photographs) and straight to the point, this gave me just the insight that I wanted into Steve Jobs and Apple's life. I admit that at the start of the book, I wasn't really getting into it. I think that this was partly because I was learning things that I didn't really know about Jobs - he certainly had a bit of a dark side and was quite fiery, but not in a very good way. I think that it's fantastic that Blumenthal did include all of those harsher details though, as it helped me to get to know what Jobs was really like behind the scenes. I went from somebody that, before opening the book, admired Jobs and his creativity, to taking quite a strong dislike to him. However, I came to understand that he was young, he had a strong personality and was determined. Although he wasn't always the most socially acceptable, he had faith in himself and what he was doing, something to admire. I'm glad to say that when I hit the half-way part of the book, I had learnt why he was acting the way he did and began to honour him a lot more. I felt as though Blumenthal was giving him a fair representation, showing both his good and bad sides - of course nobody is perfect. I thought it was really interesting to see how both Jobs and his companies progressed. It was inspiring to see that although Jobs did hit a lot of difficulties, he still kept going and wasn't afraid to take many risks. I also learned a whole lot things that I had no idea about before reading the biography, some facts were really quite surprising. Alongside the facts about business and technology, particularly towards the end, we learned more about how Jobs dealt with the news of his very poor health and the fact that he had cancer - it was incredibly heartfelt, and I was shedding a tear by the end. It's so sad that such a hugely creative mind is no longer with us, but through learning about him and his products, I'm sure that Apple will still have even more genius to unveil. Steve Jobs once said ""Your time is limited... have the courage to follow your heart and intuition"" - no other words could be more appropriate to his actions in his, sadly shortened, life. Blumenthal has done his story justice though, and has certainly made me want to abide by his words of ""stay hungry, stay foolish."" A fantastic biography, for both teenagers and adults alike, that I'd recommend to anyone wanting to learn more about Jobs, Apple and/or Pixar.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9780062012005,"http://viv-omundoencantadodoslivros.blogspot.pt/2013/03/review-starcrossed-by-josephine-angeline.html Sometimes I feel so dumb. I can't believe that I had such a wonderful book at home and it took me almost two months to start reading it. This is really something that I don't know how to explain to you. I'm completely in love with this book and wishful for the release of the second one. To be honest with you all, in the beginning I thought that maybe the story was a little too childish, it was only when Lucas appeared that everything was set in motion and star to develop in an enthusiastic way. Unfortunately, the first chapter has low quality if we compare to the book as a whole. Forgetting about the first chapter - especially the first five pages - and we have a great surprise which end's with the introduction of the Delos' family in the story. This is the moment that the veil of mystery is uncovered, we totally forget about time and we only want to know some more about what's really happening. I really enjoyed the book, in some way it seems that we only have erotic books in our bookstores, so this story was, for me, something new and separate from our market tendency. Mythology is such a great theme, there are so many topics to explore, so I don't understand why we - Portuguese readers - don't have more of these books to read. The characters are great, it was a job well done with their construction, just like it was the scenery. For me, everything was so well set that it was almost normal to see people using special powers; it was just like this was something that we see every day in our neighborhood. Although they were only teenagers, I keep forgetting it, because their behavior was similar to an adult and not a 16 year old teenager. I loved the relationship between Lucas and Helen, just like I loved Jason and Claire. Since the beginning I noticed that something special was waiting for them. Another character who made me curious was Hector, I believe we are going to see more of him on the next books. Josephine Angelini, you have conquered another fan!",Ana Luisa Neves
9781590526798,"I first heard of the ""Kingdom Series"" by Chuck Black, a homeschooling father, and began noticing it in catalogues back as early as 2004. In Kingdom's Dawn, Cedric of Chessington tells the story of Leinad beginning when the latter was sixteen years old. For four years, Leinad had been trained in swordsmanship by his farmer father Peyton who is a loyal servant of the unseen King. Leinad's mother Dinan had died when he was eight. They lived in the Kingdom of Arrethtrae on a farm in the Plains of Kerr, near the town of Mankin, along the western shore of the Great Sea. After adopting a girl named Tess, Peyton is killed by the Dark Knight Lucius, his henchman Zane, who happens to be Leinad's older brother, and their Shadow Warriors. With the help of their friend Gabrik the blacksmith, Leinad and Tess flee. Then, after escaping the destructive Vactor Deluge, they sojourn in the Valley of Nan and work on the Stanton farm. However, Leinad is betrayed by his fellow workers and sold into slavery to Lord Fairos of Pyron Mid in the region of Nyland. Eventually, Tess is captured and brought as a slave to Pyron Mid as well. Because of his training in swordsmanship, Leinad is chosen to train Fairos's men but after a battle with the Eminafs he protests Fairos's treatment people of Nan and is taken out into the Banteen Desert to be killed by the Moshi Beasts. What will happen to Leinad? And the big question is, will he remain loyal to the King no matter what? The entire Kingdom Series of six books is intended as an allegory that attempts to capture the incredible true story of the Bible. The first book covers creation, paradise, the fall, the flood, the patriarchs, and the Egyptian bondage. The second book, Kingdom's Hope, continues this line of symbolism to the end of the Old Testament. The following books are Kingdom's Edge, Kingdom's Call, Kingdom's Quest, and Kingdom's Reign. I have not read any of the others besides the first one, but someone has said that the first three are based on the Old Testament, while the last three are based on the New Testament. I have also been told that the last two do relate to the tribulation and millennium. However, what some like about them is that they are Bible-based fantasy in a medieval type of setting with no magic, mysticism, or wizardry. There is only sword fighting, along with accurate descriptions of battle and torture, but these are age-appropriate and not gratuitous. Some people may not like Biblical allegory, but I found Kingdom's Dawn to be exciting reading that is full of adventure. There are discussion questions in the back of the book.",Wayne S. Walker
9780312575939,"Originally reviewed at My Devastating Reads, www.devastatingreads.blogspot.com YA has become my new sci-fi/fantasy niche. I grew up a big fan of this genre on TV (don't ask, I'll get long winded) and YA books have really branched out since I was reading as a preteen/teen. Somehow, I missed that cool development, but I've discovered it now so I guess it's all good! Glimmerglass is a great read. Mysterious from the onset, world building and just plain fun to read. Dana is your typical teenage girl, conflicted, searching for herself and looking to find out who she is. Young readers will relate to her very easily. That she is part Fae drew me in as a reader, and I admire Dana for having shouldered the responsibility of taking care of her alcholic mother all of her life, and understand why she's finally fleeing from that reality. That she feels guilty about it but wants more from her parent(s) is understandable. And I don't envy her; her Fae father seems little better after all. That they both love her is clear, however they are also clearly not the ideal parents. Nor are they the sort of parents Dana wants or needs. I hardly expected to find that the world Black has built is so politically huge, but Dana is going to play a major role in the development of Avalon politics as a Faeriewalker. And I have a sneaking feeling that Faerie will also become a major player in this series. As for the the division among the Fae between the Seelie/Unseelie, I suspect these rivalaries are going to play a big part in the next book, as well in Dana's more personal life as I see a love triangle being set up. Yes, YA has real romance in it these days! Not that I'm so very old, but the romance in the YA I read was far too sublte for a twelve year old to perceive as romance. I could compare it to sex in Thomas Hardy novels. It's there, but not really there. However, I disgress. The romance in Glimmerglass is YA appropriate and just that, light romance. Dana's love interests (and I use that term loosely for this novel is more about set up than establishing actual relationships or even trust between characters) are Ethan, a powerfully gifted Fae that is Unseelie, or the ""bad"" kind of Fae. Ethan is, according to Dana, super hot and he saves her life at the end of the book so she is well on the road to forgiving him for having put her in life in danger earlier in the book. Then we have Keane, a Seelie who is training Dana in self defense, and is hot in that bad boy way that girls just love. The Seelie are the ""good"" Fae, and Dana herself comes from a Seelie family. So I see the possibility for a love triangle in later books. However, since I'm staying spoiler free, I have no idea where this series has gone in the next two books and I'm really excited to find out. My only compliant about this book is that it was wrapped up way too fast for my liking. However, it is a great launch into a series and a thoroughly enjoyable read. 3 stars",Giulia
9780312575939,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm.(www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) First off, Glimmerglass was amazing. I liked it a lot more than I originally thought I would. Don't you just love when that happens? I kept hearing amazing things about this book, the cover was gorgeous and the summary sounded like something I'd like. I love books with Fae in them, and this is not your typical fae book! Black created her own, unique world. I was sucked straight into the story and Dana's world from page one. Black's writing flowed well and I easily read through twenty pages without even realizing. I started this book before bed, which was a mistake. I told myself I was only going to read the Prologue, just to get a feel for the book and then I'd turn out the light and go to bed. I started to do that, but then I kept thinking about Dana. So I had to turn the light back on and read another chapter, and then another, and then another. I finally forced myself to stop at chapter five! Ha ha! I found myself thinking about Dana and Avalon while doing other things. I couldn't stop. I couldn't shut off my thoughts. I was always thinking about the world that Black had created and wondering what would happen next. I kept thinking a romance would unfold throughout the novel, but it never really did. There were a few kisses here and there, and some flirting, but never really an actual love story. But it does show a possibility of a love triangle. Maybe in Shadowspell? I really like Ethan, but I like Keane more. He's a major moody, bad-ass, hottie! I liked him from the start! :) Dana was a really good protagonist. I didn't really have any issues with her. I liked reading through her perspective. She was easy to relate to and realistic. She was spunky, and overall a fun character. She was a bit whiny and childish at times, but she knew how she was being and either stopped herself or just kept doing it anyway. I really loved how open Dana's world was. Where both the fae and humans knew about each other. It was different from the normal part where the supernatural creature was suppose to just be a fairytale. Overall, the only real issue I had in this book was the fact that in the beginning you didn't really learn much about what it meant for Dana being a faeriewalker. Other than that this was a great start to a new fae series.",Amanda
9780312575939,"Do you like stories about faeries? Or do you prefer a good thriller? Well, if you combine the two, you get an idea of what GLIMMERGLASS will be like. This is the first in a new series by adult paranormal author Jenna Black. I was a bit skeptical before reading GLIMMERGLASS. I heard many people tell me it was one of the best books they've read in 2010, and definitely a standout in the Fae genre. So it was with some cynicism that I cracked the spine of the book. From the beginning pages, when Dana has had it with her alcoholic mom, I was hooked! Dana is about to showcase her bewitching musical voice when her mom stumbles into the performance and makes a spectacle of herself. Thankfully, not many know that the disturbance is caused by her mom. But it won't be long before the talk starts again, and Dana and her mom will move on to yet another town and another school. So, without telling her mother, Dana contacts her father. Dana has never met him and her mom warns her of what life in Avalon was like. Avalon is a town in England that is home to both Fae and human. They coexist in their own world, disregarding both the laws of England and of the Faerie world, instead creating their own universe, much like Vatican City. Little does Dana realize that her father holds some power in the Fae world. She arrives at the border gate to Avalon expecting to find her father. Instead, she's interrogated and finally meets her Aunt Grace. Dana is told that her father is in prison temporarily. From that point on, Dana's life becomes a whirlwind of survival. Dana is kidnapped by the brother and sister team of Ethan and Kimber. Everything they tell Dana is opposite of what Aunt Grace has led her to believe. Until Dana's father is released from prison, Dana is unsure of whom to trust and what she should do. With political subplots and many otherworldly monsters, GLIMMERGLASS will not disappoint. Ms. Black crafts the tale in such a way that the reader truly has no idea whom to trust as the story unfolds. Even as the final pages drew closer, the story is left hanging as Ethan warns Dana to keep hidden what she has learned. I definitely give kudos to GLIMMERGLASS. Not only is the cover absolutely gorgeous, the story is well-written and incredibly addicting. Readers will have to wait until January 2011 (un)patiently for the follow up novel, SHADOWSPELL. I for one hope there is lots more of Ethan and the mysterious Keane in Dana's crazy life.",TeensReadToo
9780312575939,"Yet another favorite to add to my list for 2010 releases. Glimmerglass won my heart from start to finish, from scene to scene and from character to character. Jenna Black is another debut novelist who floored me with her quick wit and wonderful story telling and I can only hope she decides to make this series one that lasts a very long time. The debut authors of 2011 are going to have a lot to live up to with the quality of writers that we're seeing this year. We first meet the main character Dana in the human world and assume she's just like you and me, but we would be wrong. Her dad's a big powerful faery and that makes Dana special. So special that the fae have a term for her special and unique genetic make-up...she's a faeriewalker and she's the only one of her kind. Because she's so special and rare she's a trophy to some, a target for others, and in a whole lot of trouble. As much as I loved Dana, it was really the supporting characters who helped her along the way, and of course sometimes hindered her as well, but these were the ones that really stole my heart. You've got Ethan (totally drool-worthy) who is helping her one minute and playing the hero, and the next minute we're just as confused and suspicious as Dana is of his true intentions. Then we meet Finn, an honest-to-goodness knight who totally fits the bill, but has a softer side underneath the tough exterior, I just loved him. And although his son, Keane was not around as much as the rest of the gang, I'm hoping he'll surface more in the sequel. I've always loved a ""bad boy"" ya know? But let's not forget about Kimber, what a doll! You love her, you hate her, you're dying to know the recipe for her hot posset (you'll have to read it to understand what I mean), she's fantastic! Black has a way of shaping all her characters into such intricate and unique people that you can't help but want to get to know them better. This book was so great I of course flew through the pages, which was wonderful except that it was over far too quickly for my liking. I didn't want it to end and I can't wait for Shadowspell, the second installment in the faeriewalker series to come out in 2011. I'm already counting down and am dying to get my hands on a copy!",Katelyn
9780373211135,"THE ETERNITY CURE was a sequel I wasn't sure I would read too soon after the first book. I saw the book on Netgalley and like any other book addict couldn't resist to request it. It took me some time to finish THE IMMORTAL RULES and the second book was just as thick. As I had predicted the story was more on the slow side in the beginning. Allison Sekemoto is wandering around, searching for her sire Kanin. I felt like I was looking for something as well during that first third of the story and Allison's restlessness and her desire to make progress were passed on to me. When things finally started to get under way I noticed fast that THE ETERNITY CURE was a sequel that for once would bring the story forward and not just step on the same spot most of the time. Allison is joined by a familiar face known from THE IMMORTAL RULES, who appears as an unknown ally. Their constant quarreling adds a new zappiness and snark to our dismal journey through deserted planes and crumbling cities. But Allison isn't the only one searching for someone. Guess who else joins their group? A certain fair-haired boy with the warmest and kindest heart. Yes, Zeke! His and Allison's romantic feelings for each other are another puzzle they're trying to figure out on their way to finding a cure. I think I liked their moments and love story in THE ETERNITY CURE even better than in the first book, because a greater development becomes apparent. This books' title is its subject, too. Allison and her new ally - one that will certainly surprise and amuse you - are hunting psycho vampire Sarren who is holding Kanin hostage. They are also searching for a cure to the disastrous virus that's threating to destroy both humans and vampires. Theories and possible solutions are discussed and old abandoned labs explored. Julie's BLOOD OF EDEN series is the first series centering around a deadly virus that I actually felt drawn to. THE ETERNITY CURE promised hope, but is an even darker read than THE IMMORTAL RULES, full of atmosphere. It's a mix between dystopian and horror, vampires and zombies (just thinking about the manic rabids makes me shudder). This is probably no book for a queasy stomach and there will be a lot of fighting. It contains various descriptive scenes of macabre, violent and pretty bloody nature. 4/5 **** THE ETERNITY CURE - A vampire world with the most chilling and delicious post-apocalyptic feel about it! Allison isn't new to the vamp business anymore. As she gains more experience and strength, she as a character very much grew on me, too. With an honorable goal in mind Allison is embarking on a gripping and, most important, life-saving quest that will lead readers through many states of emotions, varying from bright hope to deepest despair.

9780007354467,"I was really prepared to like this novel, I really liked the premise: Dracula was real and on return from vanquishing him, Van Helsing, the Harkers, Seward, and Holmwood together with the British government created department 19 to deal with the growing 'vampire disease' and all other things paranormal. Fast forward to just over 100 years later and the descendants of the four friends, some new additions and department 19 are still flourishing in secret. Enter Jamie Carpenter, who becomes aware of the department after his father is killed and mother is kidnapped by one of the oldest vampires alive. However I do feel like this novel failed to deliver on its early promise. There was a story there but it became very much a cross between Alex Rider meets UK tv show demons with a 16 year old main character who is miraculously able to wield guns and all other manner of weapons to fight the supernatural after 24 hours of training compared to older men and women who have been training for years. And Buffy Summers, Jamie isn't. I think the biggest problem was that I did not connect at all with the main character. He was contrary and angry, not listening to anyone and somehow still happening to pick the right path and right information. It all felt very forced and while I get that a teenage boy whose mother has been kidnapped would be angry and scared, the problem was that I just didn't care. I had no emotional investment especially through the middle part of the book whatsoever. In fact throughout the middle of the novel I practically had to make myself continue reading as while virtually every scene had some action it it, the way it was told was more like a timeline than a story and like the writer was marking time and going through the motions till he could get to the good stuff at the end. I really had a hard time staying interested. The ending redeemed the tale somewhat, there were a couple of twists one I picked, one I didn't and I like the greater tale this book has set up while wrapping the current tale. I think perhaps if I were a young teenage boy, I might have enjoyed this a little more as much of the action and the slightly more blood and guts then i thought necessary did lean towards that gender however as it is, while the story itself was smart I think the promise was not fulfilled in the telling. I will probably read the next novel when it is released but I doubt it will be top of by TBR pile. I give this book 3 stars... just",Nikk Karlovsky

This book has Hilda joining the Sparrow Scouts, obviously to give her something to do with all her extra energy and imagination.

To say Janie gets in over her head is an understatement as she nearly falls victim to one of the worst kinds of evil in humanity. Cabel struggles to let Janie do what she needs to, knowing what could happen, and despite the new steps they take in their relationship, it stresses their bond until it nearly breaks. What I liked about this book was that teenage high school seniors are portrayed pretty realistically. Even the topic of safe sex is addressed, and teenagers partying too hard and dangerously. What I didn't like about this book is that I have a hard time believing that Janie would be allowed to get so deep in a mission as to be as in danger as she ends up. Then again, I know nothing about teenage NARCs. Ultimately, Fade is a really great sequel that serves to only get readers further invested in Janie's life.

Several calls have been made on Fieldridge High School's anonymous phone line. Although inaudible at times, the messages result in the assumption that certain faculty members and students at Fieldridge have been fooling around. So Captain and her agents use their closest resources to try and crack the case, meaning Janie and Cabel will have to figure out what is going on. Objection at first by Cabel, but Janie gives the final decision and both are on the case. While the investigation continues, Janie is given the chance to finally see what lies ahead for her. Hardly given any information about her ability, Captain gives Janie a box full of papers written by Martha Stubin that not only contains her secrets and past, but the positive and negative effects of helping others with their dreams. Although she may have a clue with what these effects are, Janie isn't so sure she is ready to confirm what she already knows. With the intensity of the case and her outcome, Cabel isn't so sure he can handle the danger that Janie puts herself in, and their relationship begins to weaken. Will they be able to get through this case peacefully or will it tear them apart? As a highly anticipated sequel to WAKE, FADE certainly lives up to expectations. Along with Janie, readers will be able to delve deeper into the enormity of Janie's ability and the strain that it causes not only on her but also on Cabel. The simplicity of the writing and the creativity of the plot will leave an imprint of the reader, causing it to never FADE from their mind.",TeensReadToo
9781416974482,"FADE was the best installment out of all three books. Very fast-paced with no dull moment in sight. After Janie accepts her faith as a dream catcher, she must now put her supernatural abilities to good use. Thus, along with Cabe she begins to work under-cover and her first assignment is to catch a sexual predator at her SCHOOL. The sexual predator is lurking at the only place Janie thought was safe and he is one of her own teachers. She risks her own life to get to the bottom of this case even when Cabe is totally against the whole idea. Janie comes to discover her future as a dream catcher after meeting Ms. Stubin at the retirement home, who by far is the only other dream catcher Janie is aware of. Ms.Stubin teaches Janie how to use and control her abilities properly. But where there is good there is bad: Something awful awaits Janie in the future and there is no running away from it. Her twisted future is concealed and can never be changed. Janie learns the truth about her gift/curse that will change the course of her life.....forever. This will not only affect her but also her beloved Cabe. Janie and Cabels relationship evolves and their love blossoms. Thank goddness for no love triangles! Janies mother is lazy and drunk as usual. She has a minor/annoying part in this where all she does is scold Janie, when it is because of Janie she is still alive. The reason why I prefer this novel over the other two in the trilogy is because Lisa McMann's writing style evolves. Unlike Wake, where she mostly wrote in short lines(not paragraphs), here she writes fluidly. The reader can tell Lisa put more effort into this novel than the last one. The plot of Fade is better because it has a mystery aspect to it ""who done it""?. For some odd reason, I really liked *SPOLIER* the Durbins party scene. I thought it was very well descripted and felt like I was at the party myself(too bad I couldn't save Janie).

9780525422945,"I don't know how I have gone this far and still not read the follow up. I think that I was afraid of it being from Adam's point of view because then I wasn't so used to the dual narrative and getting into the heads of our guy protagonist. But I have grown to love so much the second chance stories of love, especially first love. I wasn't easy to be in his head because he was pretty messed up and that was apparent from the beginning. Stardom hasn't been as easy on him and he'd hoped. He is anxious and feels awkward and has an issue getting through one day much less facing down a 67 day tour. It's obvious that this is a few years after the first book, but I just don't know what sort of decisions led him where he was and what became of Mia. The story is told like If I Stay, partly in the present and then flashbacks. It is interesting to get Adam's perspective for what drew him to Mia, what he thought about her more reserved nature. It was also heartbreaking to see him so messed up and wanting resolution to her disappearance without a word. The night that they spent together reveals so much and it made my heart lighter and also hurt at different times in their talking. Its hard to see how both of them are dealing with the loss of her parents and Teddy as well as their relationship. It is neat to see them on their own paths, following dreams and love of music. How the experience changes them both and little by little showing them what's important and worth fighting for. There was a good bit in this one that I didn't think that I was going to get the ending that I wanted, but I think that the weighted conversations needed to be had and the pink elephant talked about. The tension was so well written but also painful and heavy. I knew the ending I wanted for them I just didn't know how I wanted for it to come about, but I think that this way resolved it in ways that the simpler path would have left too many avenues unexplored and issues swept under the rug. I enjoyed this and can't wait to see if they make this one into a sequel movie, I will surely read it because I loved Adam's character and how Mia grew and changed.

9780525422945,"My sister and I fell in love with ""If I Stay"". Yes I was the one who cried constantly from the beginning of the book but we both came out of this book breathless and heartbroken. The idea of losing my family is unbearable and reading how she went through it? Just open up my heart and slice it will you? Yes this isn't a post about ""If I Stay"" but its sequel ""Where She Went"". If you've read the first book you'll know its told from the perspective of Mia, however I was surprised when I found out the second book is told from the perspective of Adam. That.Was.Awesome. I was SO bummed out when Stephanie Meyer stopped writing Midnight Sun which is the perspective of Edward. I always love it when I get to read both sides of the story so it was very refreshing. ""Where She Went"" does not rip your heart out, it maybe pinches it but you recover automatically, I didn't cry *shocker* so overall it was a 'happier' story. It's set three years after the accident, Adam is a rock star and Mia is a classical music prodigy. There is the flashbacks and the hurt and confusion Adam has kept pent up in his heart because of Mia's sudden disconnect from him. Again the whole book is set in one day of their life. I guess you can say Gayle Forman's books are more about the emotions and internal conflicts and reality. So while if you think about it the story can be summarized in a couple of lines but the FEELINGS and EMOTIONS that the characters and yourself experience can't be summarized, at all, trust me I've tried. While I enjoyed the book, it wasn't as emotionally deep and heart wrenching as ""If I Stay"" but it was nice to know what has happened to the two main leads for the long run. I didn't understand the reason for Mia leaving Adam and also blaming him, but what do I know? I've never had to go through what she went through. Adam truly loved Mia and it showed through this book.

9780525422945,"About three years ago, Mia and Adam went their separate ways - Mia off to Julliard and Adam off to live the life of a rock star. Adam is about to start a European tour with Shooting Star. Since heading off on his own, he has attempted to push aside the emotions he still feels for Mia. Doing so has created a whole new set of problems. Adam is becoming cut off from his fellow band members, and the resulting pressure is becoming more than he can take. His days are filled with annoying interviews, meetings, and rehearsals that he only manages to get through with the help of prescription drugs and cigarettes. His equally famous girlfriend constantly berates him about living with a ghost from his past. In New York City for a brief interview before leaving for the tour, Adam has an angry outburst due to questions from a nosy interviewer. Knowing he won't be popular, he takes off, avoiding his flight and, hopefully, the anger of his manager. His thoughts are filled with Mia, and when he stumbles across her name on the marquee for a Youth Concert series, he asks if any tickets remain. Fate intervenes and he finds himself sitting in the concert hall watching her perform. After the concert he plans to slink back to his hotel and attempt to make up for his earlier bad behavior by contacting his manager. But on his way out of the concert hall, Adam is approached by an usher, asking him to follow him to Mia's dressing room. What follows is a twenty-four-hour period of emotional ups and downs as both Adam and Mia confront the demons surrounding their complicated relationship. Adam relives the terrible months of watching Mia struggle to recover from the accident that killed her parents and her little brother. He knows he is the reason why Mia left. He had prayed for her recovery and promised he would let her go if that was what she wanted. For three lonely years, he has lived with the fact that that must have been her desire. Can Adam and Mia forgive each other and themselves before each must leave to fulfill separate responsibilities on opposite sides of the world? Author Gayle Forman takes readers back into the lives of Mia and Adam in her sequel to IF I STAY. With the focus more on Adam and his heartbreak both during and after Mia's family tragedy, Forman broadens the heartbreaking story in an emotional yet realistic direction. She explores the impact of death and separation as two people strive to overcome pain and connect with futures that satisfy them both.",TeensReadToo

There is some fantastic dialogue here with brilliantly natural conversations, but that doesn't make the most of the format. Although the accompanying art is superb there are a lot of talking heads. The art is superb with amazing colours and some brilliant lighting effects. All the jazzy stuff like digital blurring and silhouettes are used only when absolutely necessary. These are here to tell the story not to cover up how bad it is. The covers - most of which are mini works of art - are within the book, which given the episodic nature is fine.

He moves into an abandoned house full of stories and mystery. The book follows Max, his sister Alicia and their new-found friend Roland as they discover secrets about the place they live and the people they are close to. There are parts in this book that are downright creepy. A statue of a clown that's facial expressions change every so often? Clowns can be creepy anyway but that oversteps the line. The said parts of the book are really good - they got my heart racing and my hands turning the pages as fast as possible. But to be honest, there were too few of them for me to enjoy the book. Aside from that, I thought the characters had no real depth to them. They did at first but then they sort of lost it as the story progressed and focused more on the plot. There was no real development in them until the end at which point I pretty much didn't care what happened to them. It's for that reason that I felt like the book was a disappointment. If I don't care what happens to the characters, and something does happen to the characters, then I won't like the whole story - characters are a major deal Having said that, this book does deserve some credit for how creepy it was at times which is something I love in any book.

Some are vile and wicked, others can be cute and fun. They can be anything from a massive ogre to an animated umbrella. An exciting beginning to a new manga series! Riku is 3/4 human and grew up in a house full of yokai, his grandfather is the supreme commander of the Nura clan. Growing up Riku has heard all the tales and thinks that the yokai are cool, special and the good guys but once he starts school he learns differently. He speaks up against someone who has done a report on the demons and tells the truth about his household, everyone laughs at him and doesn't believe him. He learns the truth at home. Five years pass and Riku is a young bespectacled teenager, who is supposed to take over as the leader of the Nura Yokai clan but he refuses to have anything to do with them. Being 3/4s human, this is easy for him to do but somehow that 1/4 yokai blood comes out every once in a while and that 1/4 of Riku is very different and *he* wants to be the leader he is meant to be. For a first volume this is packed with story and background. Much happens and I was drawn into the world right away. Riku's city has a high amount of yokai activity so we see them popping up frequently and a rival clan comes to town to challenge Riku's leadership causing an instant conflict. Riku is a complex character wanting no part of the evilness of yokai, yet protecting his clan from being found out by school mates. He battles emotionally with the repugnance of the evil that some yokai do and the petty thievery of others, while at the same time obviously loving and caring for the yokai he has grown up with. On top of that, there is plenty of humour from many sides. The story is light but can get intense, though not dark, at this point anyway.

Before he can truly become an apprentice, he must find his locus magicalicus (the stone which will focus his magical power) in a most unlikely place, convince Nevery that one of his fellow wizards is consorting with the city's cruel Underlord, and figure out why the city's magic is fading away--and how to save it--before the city dies from the lack of it. It's a terribly large task for a boy who has only just started learning his letters, but Conn is nothing if not resourceful. THE MAGIC THIEF will pull readers in so completely that they'll have trouble setting the book aside. The details of the Victorian-esque world are so vividly drawn that readers will feel the chill of the icy winds and taste the buttery goodness of Conn's favorite biscuits. What makes the book particularly special is Conn himself. His voice is lively, with exactly the sort of street-smart practicality and frankness you'd expect from a boy who has spent most of his life on the streets. Despite his criminal background, Conn is good-hearted, and simply longs for a place where he can make something of himself. Readers will sympathize with his struggle to prove himself to Nevery and the city's authorities, and appreciate his clear-headed thinking amid all the secrecy and scheming of the adults around him. The novel's conclusion is quite satisfying, while leaving lots open for the second book in the trilogy, which many will be clamoring to get as soon as they have finished this one. An all-round enjoyable read that easily stands out from the many fantasy novels on the shelves. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo

9781423101963,"The cliched plot points of convenience, tedious exposition of character pasts, as well as incredibly 2D side characters are only marginally redeemed by the sympathetic if rather dense protagonist Thom and his cute, blooming romance with his mysterious ""rival"" Goran. The action and intensity does pick up during the last third of the book, with murders and betrayals that depart almost entirely from the self-centered teen angst in the beginning. Nonsensical character decisions, appearances, and fatalities however, did nothing but frustrate me, despite the fact that the final ""twist"" was a relatively pleasant surprise.

One who is shunned by the League as well as nearly every member of society. Oh, and Thom has superpowers of his own. Obviously, life has never been normal, but Thom does his best to fit in. He shines on the school basketball team and does volunteer work while holding down three jobs. Until a series of events that would swallow any other kid whole sends Thom reeling into the very world he's been kept away from his entire life: the world of superheroes. Now, while still trying to learn everything he can about his powers, the mysterious disappearance of his mother, and his own unexplored feelings, Thom is faced with new challenges. What he learns is that nothing is as it appears. Nothing and no one. A plot- and action-driven novel, this book is ground-breaking in many ways. Not just in the obvious ways that one might think, although it is interesting to have a gay, teenage superhero as a protagonist. What kept me riveted was the look Moore offers at society. Our tendency to build people up and glory in tearing them to shreds and examining what's left. We thrive on heroes and everything they stand for, and yet, we're never content, as a people, to allow the heroes to enjoy the very things we want them to protect, like humanity, freedom, and individualism. This book is smart. It keeps the reader engaged with a fast-paced scenes and one intriguing character after another while it conveys a message of redemption.",TeensReadToo
9780142416891,"In this final book of THE LOOKING GLASS WARS trilogy, Wonderland's Heart Crystal's powers have been depleted and so have the powers of Imagination. This leaves Wonderland vulnerable to its enemies, which, according to the caterpillar oracles, are many. With doubts in the air and hidden enemies within Wonderland, who may even be people pretending to be her friend, Alyss forms an uneasy truce with Redd, the queen who killed her parents and took over Wonderland. Their goal: to defeat Arch, the King of the Boarderland. With little chance of counting on Imagination to save them and the stakes high, will Alyss find a way to keep her throne and save her people? Who can she really trust? This book had a lot of violence in it, much like the first two in the series, but was an excellent conclusion to the trilogy. The plot was intense and well-thought out. The main characters are well-developed and stayed true to their natures that the author created for them. Fans of the original ALICE IN WONDERLAND, fantasy, and adventure will all enjoy reading ARCHENEMY, but will need to read THE LOOKING GLASS WARS and SEEING REDD first, in order to be able to follow the story.",TeensReadToo

9780062217134,"Loved Ezra's voice... Funny and captivating. Exactly what a male protagonist should be. The first person pov works well here, and Robyn Schneider the author is a great storyteller through Ezra. Ezra was sarcastic and tragic, making heavy and light of just the right things. He was brutally honest at times, but also knows how to tell the story without being gratuitous or grusome, but still getting his point across. I just loved the writing style so much! I reviewed this because I loved the synposis, the weird first name of Severed heads, broken hearts (before it changed to the Beginning of Everything) intrigued me, and especially since it was on Edelweiss, though I would have eventually bought or got from the library. Friendship with Toby was good too and hate they went apart for a while but story would have been different. Makes me think about all the little decisions that really effect so much. I adored Toby because he took Ezra right back into his circle without question. He gave him a hard time only in that I love you man ragging kind of way, letting him know by saying the opposite that he accepts him. Cassidy is the love interest in this one, and she is elusive, seems not to care what others think, just is her own person. I liked her, and wanted to know more about her, and only very little by little did it come out. I think that her and Ezra work together, and though there is a bit of insta-love it seems more at first like physical attraction and seeing a wounded part of each other's soul and connecting that way. So, it worked for me, but I can see how it might not for some others. I really enjoy the debate group too. What made this awesome was just that everyone was realistic. No one was perfect, and had their strengths and weaknesses. They were more than one dimensional as well, which is awesome. The ending is so bittersweet, because some of the things I wanted to happen and work out didn't but ultimately we see this huge character growth and development in Ezra that somehow made it all worth it. Bottom Line: Awesome witty writing style, a bittersweet character driven story.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9781447206804,"I absolutely loved Alyson's The Immortals series and The Riley Bloom series so I couldn't resist buying this book which is the first of a planned four books called The Soul Seekers series. The cover of this book is lovely, it has a really calm and peaceful feeling to it. Once I started reading I found that at the beginning I struggled to fully understand what was going on, but I still managed to become completely absorbed by it. Daire's dreams were confusing yet very intriguing, I felt like I needed to read on to find out what they meant and so it was very difficult to put the book down. Everything about this story is interesting with many magical and spiritual moments that really captured my imagination. The vision quest in particular was a strange but powerful event in the book and it marked a definite turning point in Daire's journey. One thing that really sticks out in my mind from this book is the clubbing cockroach, it may sound crazy but when you read it you'll understand! It was a defining moment for Daire that enabled her to truly understand what she was up against. The book grew in intensity as it neared the end and my heart was pounding with nerves over what Daire was planning. I look forward to seeing Daire and Dace's relationship grow in the books to come, by the end of this book I felt a little unsure as to where they were headed. The ending left me wanting so much more, I have lots of questions that will hopefully be answered in the next book Echo which is due to be released in November 2012. This is a fascinating and, at times, very dark story that gripped me from start to finish.",Kate Verrier
9781447206804,"Fated is the new novel from Alyson Noel and she has not disappointed! It includes a heroine, hunky guys, magic and so much more. Definitely an exciting read! The plot itself is an excellent idea, with resemblance's to her previous novels, The Immortals. I also enjoyed the idea of spirit animals in the book and the powers that come with being a Seeker. It was most definitely interesting to read and I was keen to know more. I really admire the main character, Daire, because Alyson Noel has portrayed her as a strong character that isn't afraid to voice her own opinions. I also admire how Noel portrays relationships, as from the start as the reader you feel quick sad for Daire as it comes across that she doesn't really have anyone close to her other than her mother. But as the characters begin to grow, relationships grow. I do have to admit that there was perhaps a little less action and eye opening scenes than I expected, however I have no worry that the next book, Echo, will not disappoint in providing this!",Maria
9781907411274,"If you think that ballet dancers have it easy, think again...or read Bunheads, Sophie Flack's debut novel all about the life of a dancer with the prestigious Manhattan Ballet Company. Hannah Ward is doing what she's always wanted to do - dance. Hannah's whole life has revolved around ballet, and now that's she nineteen, it's about to get a lot tougher. Adding to the general drama of dancing life, Hannah meets Jacob, a talented musician who she is instantly attracted to. Hannah's committment to ballet and the dancing world, however, proves to be a test in her new relationship, as Hannah grows to realise there is more to the world than just dancing. I fell in love with this book from the minute I first heard of it. I love books to do with dancing, and it's not often that you get one that portrays the real life world as a dancer. Bunheads was a true on form account on what happens in a dance company - written by a dancer herself. Bunheads is definitely a book for the older YA readers, as it's definitely not your average Ballet Shoes or Angelina Ballerina read. Bunheads is gritty - it's a world where eating disorders are rife and dancers are under the pressure to remain thin and waife-like. Friendships are tested and the claws come out in wanting to show up each other - and these girls aren't even twenty yet. But this is what I loved about the book. It shows a different side to ballet - certainly not the glamourous side that we see going to watch a performance, but what happens backstage. Yet at the same time, while the reader is asking Why on earth would you put yourself through all of that? you are given the picture of what makes ballet so beautiful, and where the love of dancing comes from for many of the girls. What I also enjoyed about the book was that the main character wasn't some wimpy, naive girl. Hannah was a strong character, but at the same time she was exactly like every girl in the company - catty and bitchy towards the other dancers, quick to pick faults with her friends and talk about them behind their back. Sure, this isn't exactly the type of trait you'd want in a friend, but what makes Hannah unique compared to all of her dancer friends is that she realises that there's a life outside of it all, and that dancing has, in a way, shaped her to be a person that she really doesn't want to be. There were at times, when Hannah was a little too selfish and wrapped up in her own world so much that you wanted to strangle her, but I'm starting to realise that when reading a book, that's a good thing. Emotions mean I'm enjoying the book. And then the romance. Oh, I lapped this up. Jacob was perfect. I loved him myself. I loved how understanding he was about Hannah's ballet, and how awestruck he was by her dancing. How from the word go, he took it on board, he didn't glamourize it and he was supportive. He wasn't afraid, as well, to speak up about how much he was hurting when she put dancing before him. But always, he was still there for her. And it broke my heart, it tore me in two, it made me sigh in contentment and wish that I could have a Jacob in my life! While for those who don't know the ballet world (like I do; this was a dream come true for me), understanding the French terminology may be difficult, as there was no index to what certain words mean, and thus are lost in translation when trying to understand why Hannah is sweating away at trying to perfect certain moves. This is still an enjoyable novel, and in a world where ballet is so hot right now (thanks, Natalie Portman), this is one book you'll want to read. You'll feel like a dancer, if only for a little while.",Hannah
9781907411274,"I was eagerly anticipating this book being published in the UK after hearing rave reviews of it from many international reviewers. I've never been particularly interested in the ballet, but this book gave a very fascinating insight into the dancing world. This book will certainly appeal to anyone who has an interest in dance as well as fans of coming of age, contemporary novels. Apparently, this book also has a lot of likeness to Black Swan (though toned down), though I've never watched it - so if you liked that, check this out! It is clear that Sophie Flack, the author, has an incredible knowledge of ballet and the inner workings of ballet groups. There is quite a lot of dance-related terminology used without any explanation but I don't think that it is at all necessary to know what all of the terms mean - it's easy to just get drawn into Hannah's world. Hannah is our protagonist who is completely devoted to her art . However, alongside her, we struggle to decide whether she is making the best choice for herself - can she be a ballerina and lead a 'normal' life? It's hard to say and even at the end, it's difficult to know if Hannah has made the right choice for herself or not. Hannah is a very down to earth and realistic character and it's understandable to see how and why she had issues with her options for the future. I wouldn't say that there were many 'OMG' moments or huge plot twists, but there is a lot of underlying drama in Bunheads. The book is rather subdued and relaxed but it's certainly not boring - it's just subtle. There is the right amount of gritty and raw information about the strictness and mentality of some dancers. The details are quite constant and very realistic. The novel wasn't so much focused on the struggles of being a dancer but rather with how Hannah and her friends dealt with them and how they grew and developed in such a disciplined situation. I thought that the relationships in this book were very well written. Hannah's friendships are typical of an environment that's quite female dominated and very competitive. I found it difficult to trust some of Hannah's friends, just like she did. I did find them quite endearing in their own way though and everyone in the group had distinct personalities and attitudes. I really loved Hannah and Jacob's relationship. It took a while for chemistry to build up between them and I did feel sorry for both of them a lot of the time. I sympathised with Jacob for putting so much effort into trying to spend time with Hannah and I sympathised with Hannah for finding it difficult to find that time. I found their relationship to be very realistic, I just loved the development of it and that they worked together through the problems. I don't know what Hannah was doing with the other love interest, the balletomane Matt, but it was interesting to see the different kinds of people that dancers come across in their lives. Overall, this was a very interesting book which taught me a lot about the backstage goings-on of ballet dancers and the hard work that they go through, both physically and mentally. This was a relaxed but entertaining book that had me questioning to the end. I think that this one will appeal to a lot of young adult and adult readers alike.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9781908435330,"I bought this book as soon as I saw it in online bookstore. I didn't know one of my favorite writers wrote a new book. I immediately ordered it and waited to get it. When I got it, I started reading it while walking home from post office. Melvin Burgess is one of my favorite writers since I was a teen. I read all his books that are translated in Lithuanian. Even now, when I'm adult, I still like to read his books. I buy every new book that appears in Lithuania like crazy and read it as fast as I can. It's not the highest class book, but it has something in it that made me read it non-stop for two days. A plot is very intriguing, just thrilling!

9781908435330,"The premise of this book sounded very intriguing which enticed me to buy it; a deadly drug that allows you complete freedom for a week. Unfortunately the idea of the story is the only good thing going for this book. I couldn't even get through the first chapter. It's poorly edited, the characters are annoying and unrealistic with stilted dialogue. It was just painful to read. The entire thing didn't suspend my belief at all and has put me off from reading the rest.

9781908435330,"""What a concept!"" - was my original impression, and what's better, I bought a limited edition, signed copy. THEN, I actually read the book. The plot line was completely different to what I was expecting. Instead of being the story of a teenaged boy playing out his last week alive, it turned into a futuristic, radical, anti-government plan to rule the world using drugs. At a number of key plot stages, I lost interest, but continued reading in the hope that it would improve. The ending seemed tacked on in the hopes to have a Hollywood-style happy ending; aiming for a film deal, perhaps? The characters lacked depth and were, quite frankly, very irritating. I found myself hoping they'd take a hit of poison just to finish the story early so I didn't have to read about them anymore. Having read some of Burgess' other works, I was disappointed in the characters of this novel. Even the antagonists bored me a little. I was also assuming that this novel was rushed with its release; bad editing plagues the pages, irking the reader. It made me think a teenager had actually edited the novel, not professionals who are paid to perform this fairly simple duty. It often seemed like words had been removed to change the sentence structures, without actually changing the sentence structures. Simple spelling errors grated my inner grammar nerd, who screamed at the offending pages. In summary, wait for a revised edition of the novel where these issues are fixed and you may find a novel worth reading. Alternatively, wait for the movie version, which will hopefully improve the character and plot issues.",Glenn George
9781908435330,"The Hit is about a boy called Adam, who isn't exactly with happy his life. The girl he likes doesn't seem to be too impressed with him and his brother is gone. When he hears that there's a new drug in town, called Death, he's tempted to try it. It will give you one amazing week... and then you die. I thought the concept of the book sounded very interesting, but soon after I started reading, I was quite disappointed. The main characters, Adam and Lizzie, are some of the 'flattest' characters I've ever read about, which made me not care about them at all. They are pouty, angry and read more like an adult's image of a teenager than actual teenagers. Some decisions they made seem to be completely random (Adam has a plan to get Lizzie pregnant because she is rich, but when she hear about it and gets angry, he just drops it and it's never mentioned again) and a lot of the story line seems to be present just to shock the young readers. It feels like the book was written for 10-years-old, but with topics for teenagers. One of my biggest pet peeves is when an author hints at a certain 'secret detail' so often that there is NO POSSIBLE WAY you can miss it. It takes all the mystery from any possible 'revelation' and frankly makes it seems like he is talking down to his audience. I don't care if the intended audience is younger than I am, it doesn't hurt to make them work a little bit and surprise them once in a while. The only thing I enjoyed about this book were the two 'bad guys', the rich and psychotic Christian and his body guard Vince. Vince reminded me a lot of Butler, from the Artemis Fowl series, which might have helped my appreciation for him. Christian keeps Lizzie hostage and mistreats her in some really messed up ways. What makes his character interesting is that he is extremely unstable and can go from perfectly harmless to crazy axe murderer in a matter of seconds. I mostly enjoyed Vince's presence in the story because I couldn't quite figure out who's side he's was on. I guess I liked both characters because they were the only unpredictable factors in the book. In conclusion, The Hit is a very fast read with some interesting ideas, but it left me extremely frustrated with almost every aspect of the plot and writing.",Sanne

9781442426641,"I went into this third instalment of the Hush, Hush ""saga"" not expecting to love it because I had been disappointed in Crescendo but hoping to get answers to my many questions. Do the Nephilim finally become free? Do the fallen angels finally get what's coming to them? Do I get to see an archangel please, pretty please? Does Vee actually get a boyfriend that doesn't want to kill her best friend? And does Vee ever find out about the angel community in any level of detail? Sadly only one of these questions got a yes. The prologue begins in the past, three months before the time of chapter one but four days after the cliff-hanger of Crescendo. The reader isn't given too much detail right away on what happened right after Hank Miller stormed in with his militia on Nora and Patch but we know that Nora has been kidnapped, and Hank is using her as leverage to ensure that Patch keeps his end of the deal up. What does Patch need to do, he needs to get Hank information on the fallen angels but Patch doesn't really want to play. After a cringe worthy few lines of ""lets literally rip Hank apart piece by piece until he caves"" Patch makes another deal (because surprisingly Hank didn't cave), one that will ensure Nora's release whether he gets Hank the information or not: he'll give Hank his wings, and that ladies and gentlemen, plus the fact that Nora is released with no memory of the events of Hush, Hush and Crescendo is the set up to Silence. I hated the premise of this book, memory loss? Now don't get me wrong, I don't see a huge problem with Nora not remembering her time of the kidnapping because well as a friend pointed out - had she not had her memory erased then she wouldn't have been set free. But to erase everything she went through in Hush, Hush and Crescendo so she knows absolutely nothing about Patch and everything angels so she has to relearn them? Such a waste of time, in fact the first half of the book is Nora being fed half-truths and lies about the past five months of her life, getting all lusty over the colour black and taking one stupid risk after the other. If the reader didn't know everything Nora had forgotten then I would have been interested because I'd want to unravel the mystery with her but here the only thing I was interested in was what the hell Hank was up to. Besides the whole Nora doesn't know anything plot line there were clues and titbits of news about an impending war between Nephilim and fallen angels, almost every chapter there was a mention of Chesvhan approaching and after all that build-up we don't get a war we get a cliff-hanger, a ""to-be-continued"" because over 200 pages was wasted on Nora regaining her memory and figuring out her past instead of a tension filled build-up to a war that pits immortal army against immortal army.

You are living in The United Safer States of America and things such as obesity, verbal abuse, and dangerous activities are against the law. The legal driving age is twenty-six. Even sports such as football are illegal. Sports that are allowed are hindered due to all the safety gear the participants are required to wear. This is the world that sixteen-year-old Bo Marsten inhabits. Bo has inherited a bit of a temper from his father who has been in prison since 2073 for road rage. He has been in trouble at school many times for ""failing to control his antisocial impulses,"" but when he is falsely accused of causing a rash that spreads throughout the school, his anger gets the best of him and he assaults a classmate. This action lands him in a work camp in the middle of the Canadian tundra that is surrounded by hungry polar bears. The work camp Bo is sent to is a factory that makes pizzas. He becomes a member of a four man team with the responsibility of using the pepperoni gun. Each pull of the trigger on the pepperoni gun delivers twenty-six pepperoni on each pizza. When the team works in sync, life isn't so bad. There is only one group that causes Bo problems while he is there, the Goldshirts. The Goldshirts are an elite group at the pizza factory that have special privileges like a variety of food, when the others only have defective pizzas to eat for every meal, every day. The Goldshirts main job is to play football for the warden. All new editions to the work camp eventually have a tryout in front of the warden. This entails running and catching a pass. If you catch it, you become a Goldshirt and are placed on the team. Bo makes the team and experiences physical activity without protective gear for the first time in his life. The warden requires that the team practice every day for several hours in order to prepare for an illegal game with another work camp. If you want to remain a Goldshirt, you play even if you are injured. After surviving work camp and brutal football games, Bo, with the help of an unlikely attorney, is released from his sentence and allowed to go home. Bo begins to think about life in the USSA and considers where else he can go that would allow more freedom. Pete Hautman has written a unique sports novel for the sci-fi/fantasy lover. This interesting look at what might happen to a society more concerned with safety than freedom is a page-turner.

Well, actually, the boy down the street, but it's close enough. The only problem is that Mark doesn't show any interest in seeing Shug in the same way she sees him. For Mark, the perfect girl is Celia, Shug's beautiful, popular older sister. Thus begins the summer of Shug's twelfth year, and it's not going anything like what she had planned. She's suddenly seeing everyone in her life in a totally different way, and she's not so sure that she likes what she sees. Her mother, who she once thought of as deep and sophisticated, now seems the opposite. The North Carolina native who went ""up North"" to college isn't suave and chic--she's snobby, standoffish, and an alcoholic. Her dad, a businessman who frequently travels away from home, comes home less and less and stays for even shorter amounts of time. Even beautiful Celia, who seems to have the perfect life, seems to be changing right before Shug's eyes. And then there's Mark, who she's almost given up hope on. Now that she has to help Jack Connelly, the bad boy of her school who has gotten in more trouble than she can name, with his homework, she even finds herself seeing him in a new light. Is he really as bad as everyone thinks? Can people change so significantly in even short amounts of time? And as for Shug, is she really the girl she thought she was?

9781442409101,"For some reason, I was never dreading the end of this trilogy but I was immensely curious to see how things turned out and how the books would be wrapped up. Fever had a number of big reveals for us, and I was anticipating learning more about those reveals. The Chemical Garden trilogy is one that has shocked me from beginning to end, and I applaud Lauren's thoughtfulness in writing these books. Yet they failed to completely resonate with me, and left me wanting more from them in the end. Reasons to Read: 1. Rhine finds her independence: YAY! Awesome. I love that Rhine really has more of an opportunity in Sever to step out on her own, without really needing to rely on someone else (more specifically, without relying on any one boy). I don't think we see enough of this in YA, and I appreciate that Rhine takes the time to step back from relationships for a little while to figure out what her plan is, and then figures out who will be a part of that along with her. (I will add, however, that it takes a while for her to really get into this role, and the lead-in was far too slow. It takes her a little while to break those chains.) The introduction of additional, fascinating characters: 2. I, for one, really loved both Reed and Rowan (how many people in this book have names that begin with ""R""?) - I thought they both really added to the story and gave the plot a bit more depth. They both shed a bit more light on the world, and specifically on Vaughn. Plus they change Rhine's perception of people and her situation, and frankly I wish we had seen more of them earlier on in the series because they ended up being two of my favourites. They pulled at my heartstrings, and all those warm, fuzzy feelings (in sad ways). I finally realized why this series hasn't resonated with me the way I expected it to though. So much of this book feels very adult-oriented to me, particularly with regards to its themes and issues. I have a much harder time relating to the characters because of this, and as interesting as it is I just feel disconnected in the end. The very nature of the world is one that forces Rhine (and other characters) to grow up far too quickly; there essentially is no childhood experience. And for that reason, I realized in Sever that I have a harder time connecting with this book and the series overall. We still see some evidence of Rhine's young age, with her conflicting feelings towards other characters. But this has dragged on for so long (the back and forth between the boys (especially), her sister-wives, and even Vaughn) in the series and in Sever in particular that I just stopped caring altogether. And while I found many of the reveals to be fascinating, the ending felt like it was rushed and wrapped up too quickly. It surprised me, because very few things were left as open as I expected given the circumstances. And frankly some of the plot twists didn't shock me like they should have, because it seemed to me that they didn't have very big of an impact and weren't written as poignantly as the situation deserved. Sever is a wild ride for sure, full of shocks and twists, and leaves you with a surprising amount of hope considering the dark world the characters live in. I loved that it isn't entirely a dreary experience, and that there can be some goodness found at the end of the all for Rhine and her story. It just lacked the punch it should have had as the end of a trilogy, but the introduction of new characters and an intriguing world were enough for me to still enjoy Sever.

Then in comes Tomohiro and her life starts to change. She starts to see drawings literally come to life. Ink has so much Japanese culture, you just know Amanda Sun visited Japan. Every walk down the street, every corner is described in intricate detail. I loved it. I felt like I was right there in Shizuoka, Japan myself. I loved the words that were used and the little glossary in the back. I love the phrases and the style of the Japanese culture. So well researched! But then I realized this felt more like a Japanese drama or more simply put a romance because we get to see very little mythology descriptions. It felt a little flat and there wasn't a whole lot of story from the paranormal aspect. I felt a little let down only because everything else was so good. I just felt that the romance too importance of the story and that distracted me from ever really seeing or in this case understanding what was happening. Where did she get the powers? How does Tomo relate to this all? Why are they even after him in the first place? If only some of these questions would be answered. Because not everything in a teen book has to be about a boy. Beautiful intricate writing with a promising mystery, Ink will have you transported to Japan and make you want to stay there in all it's wonderful glory.",Giselle SM

But after he mother dies and her grandfather is too sick to look after her, Katie is shipped off to go live with her aunt in Shizuoko. Struggling to cope with the language and culture change, Katie muddles along in the hope that her grandfather will get better and she can flee Japan and live in Canada. And then she sees the ink. Yuu Tomohiro, the school's badboy and kendo legend, the guy who cruelly breaks up with his girlfriend and pretends to be someone he isn't fascinates Katie. And there's his drawings. The calligraphy that's so lifelike, Katie would almost swear that it moves... I've never read a book which incorporates Japanese Mythology like Amanda Sun did in Ink. The concept of the power of the pen - or the ink - is something new on the paranormal scene. The Kami are dangerous with their medium being writing - something people take for granted - and yet the spirit in the ink is powerful and non-discriminating. I did think that this book had a very strong start but sort of faded as things developed. I was immediately drawn in at the start but towards the end I wasn't as captivated. I loved the way Japanese culture was portrayed in Ink, The way the language and the customs were interspersed throughout the novel was great to read. I wasn't surprised to learn that Amanda Sun had spent quite a lot of time in Japan. As someone who has never been to that part of the world, it felt authentic and real. As for the characters - I found Katie to be slightly frustrating. Her behaviour was inconsistent and I thought she was slightly illogical. Her selfish nature took me out of the story at times and I much preferred the easy-going nature of her friends Tamaka and Yuki. Yuu Tomohiro was one of those characters that's mysterious and gorgeous and as a result one I wanted to read more of. I liked his arrogant exterior but the more we got to know him, the more we got to see he had layers and interesting complexities. This is a great novel with a unique type of paranormal element. The characters are interesting however I liked the supporting cast more than I did the main character. I'm excited to see where Amanda Sun takes her characters in the next book of the Paper Gods series.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780373210718,"Ok there are so many things about this book that I loved, but the first thing that caught my attention was the location, Japan! I love Japan and everything about it, but there aren't that many YA books set in this place and the books that are tend to be based mainly in the past. The author gives us a glimpse into the contemporary Japan and using imagery and humor shows us many of the places and things that I would love to see for myself one day. I also loved how she was able to interweave a lot of the culture and mythology of Japan without making it seem like a history lesson. Then there was the paranormal aspect to the story. I really liked the unusual powers the characters had with Ink and trying to figure out exactly what it was and how it worked. There was a lot we learned about it, but just as many questions arose from it as well and I can't wait to find out more in the next book. Katie is a really strong willed character and I really admired her spirit. I liked that although she made mistakes she still kept trying. Just like when she was trying to learn the language. At first she wasn't that great at it and even though her friends didn't mind speaking to her in English she chose to keep on trying and perfect her Japanese instead of just giving up. She is a fun character to get to know and a bit quirky at times too. Tomohiro was an interesting character and although I was a bit leery of him at first I really came to like him right along with Katie. He keeps to himself and for good reason, but once you get past that hard outer shell he really is a sweety and really funny. I love how he interacts with Katie and the way he sometimes teases her. It is so much fun to see them together. It was also great that he could also be so lighthearted and have a sense of humor about things given the situation he is in. I think he and Katie make a great team and I can't wait to see more of them. I also loved Katie's two friends Yuki and Tanaka. Yuki is one of her first friends and she is one of my favorites. She is always cheerful and a lot of fun to be around kind of likes Tanaka who is a bit of a goofball. I liked how supportive they were of Katie even when things got really weird. They are definitely the kind of people I would love to be friends with. Overall this is an exciting read with an imaginative new world that I am dying to read more of!",katie

But, there is no other choice to make; she has to go to Shizuoka, Japan, with her aunt, who she barely knows. If that wasn't bad enough, being the new foreign in school and not be able to communicate as a normal person with a fluent Japanese, she overhears someone breaking up with the kendo star of her school, Tomohiro. Tomohiro has a big secret, and he won't tell anyone, but when Katie sees how the things he draws start moving, there is no way he could hide his secret anymore, or, at least, not from Katie. But then again, things are more complicated. When Tomohiro is with Katie, he loses all the control he has over his ability. What would happen if the wrong people find out about Tomohiro's connection with ink? Will they survive the danger that entail having the gift to control ink? Will love conquer all? ""They tell you you'll forget how it used to be. You'll get used to it, that it's better to move on. They don't realize you can't. You're not the same person anymore."" Review: Wow! That is the only word that came to our mind while we were reading Ink. We had Ink in our shelves for a while, for one months more or so. We requested this book on Netgalley because we were so attracted by its cover (isn't it amazing, the cover?). But once we had Ink, we read the description and we were a little bit doubtful... We have to admit that, by that time, we were not so much into Asian culture, and we say WERE, because after reading Ink something inside of us awake (Rosa: it remembered my old times reading manga *blushing*). We found each other looking forward to know more about Japan. We even tried to speak Japanese from the glossary. It did not go as we expected (Epic fail! Seems like we have Katie's problem as well. No worries, we'll keep trying, though). But we don't regret having read Ink. We are glad we did. It is an astonishing, full of mystery and forbidden love story that would hooked you from the first page. What we loved most was the plot. The fact that Tomohiro, a Kami or paper God, isn't the I-can-beat-anyone-if-I-want type of hero, the kind we are totally familiarized with, if one of the things that made us got crazy in love with this book. Well, he can-beat-anyone-if-he-wants type of guy, if he wants to! Tomohiro is just a teenager boy who is struggling with something he didn't not ask for, his so precious gift (as maybe someone may put), and the one that hunts him on his dreams. We loved so much that for once, the hero on the story is vulnerable and the thing that makes him so special, is the one that could destroy him. We loved how it was a unique weft, not something you read all days. We should say that, if you haven't guessed by now, we are madly and deeply in love with Tomohiro. He is such a badass and he acts like a jerk when he is around Katie. But deep down, he is a sweet boy with a big heart. We know he cares about Katie, although he is pushing her away with all efforts. The way he acts around people he care is because he wants to protect them from him. He is so afraid to hurt the people he loves that he prefers to be alone. So lonely and honorable. He's definitely one of our favorite hero's-non hero's! And, of course, he's already in our Unofficial Teams list (*wink, wink*) We also love Katie's character. She is always determined to get what she wants that she pursues her plans until the end. She did not give up because something was on her way. She is such a brave, and stubborn, girl. We like that attitude in our heroines; courageous, spirited, smart... (because God knows how difficult is to learn Japanese! We have tried a few words, you know that) and of course... Not to speak for the fact that she's living in a different country, with a person she barely knows and speaking a language she's not familiar with, but she keeps trying. She tries to get to know her aunt and to be part of her life and she even tries to speak Japanese, though it's not her language. Even when people offer her to speak her language, she keeps speaking Japanese in order to learn. That's not an easy task. That's what we like about her. Besides that, she is falling in love with our beloved Tomohiro, which helped her to make us fall in love with her as well. As for the bad guys of Ink, well... there is Ishikawa, Tomo's best friend. He is and he is not the antagonist character of the story. At first, we thought that he was an ******* because of everything he's done (and will do *look of disapproval*). However, we think that he is just an misunderstood boy. We know for sure, or we want to think, that he is a good guy, deep down, and that he only made the wrong decisions. And that, maybe, he likes, again deep down, our beloved Katie. Geez, we would be thrilled to keep writing about Ink, but we are afraid that we may not be able to stop. We have so much to say about Amanda's work, that it would take ages to finish. Despite this, we think that if you want to find out more about Ink, the best way to do it is to read the book. You will see what we are talking about. To end with our humble review, we would like to strongly recommend you Ink, and its prequel (which is FREE on amazon) as magical as the first Paper Gods series. This is a magnificent book that would make you want to be in Japan just to be part of the story. We can assure you that you are gonna love it and that you are not going to be able to stop reading until you know everything! For all the reasons exposed before, we are honored to give Amanda's book, Ink, 5 gorjuss doll.",TUABFC
9780373210718,"With a mixed bag of reviews for Ink, I did head into it with some hesitation, only to be pleasantly surprised. After Katie's mom dies, she has to move to Japan to live with her aunt Diane. She's out of her depth. She doesn't know much about Japanese culture and she's struggling with the language. She would have much preferred to have been sent to Canada to stay with her grandparents. When she accidentally eavesdrops on the break up of Tomohiro Yuu and his soon to be ex-girlfriend, and sees one of his sketches move, her life is about to take a very unexpected turn. Tomohiro is rude, mean and dangerous, with a bad reputation and secrets in his past. But after what Katie has seen, she just can't forget it. And does become a little obsessed about it. She wants to know where he sneaks off to everyday and did he really cheat on Myu and get another girl pregnant? I admit that Katies obsession and actions around this point was a bit over the top. I really enjoyed Ink though. With the mysterious Tomohiro, a twist of Japanese mythology, involvement with the Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia, and also the Kami, who plan to take over and rule Japan, there was a lot going on, and after getting over a few glitches in the beginning, I was thoroughly entertained throughout. I also found that the romance was really sweet and I enjoyed it a lot, with some nice little moments. Katie, while a likeable character, I felt had the potential to be an awesome character. But some of the things that she says/thinks are just really stupid and I felt should have been edited, as they didn't seem to fit with the character that the author was trying to create. These were mostly at the beginning of the book so it wasn't as annoying as the story continued. Katie was mostly a tough, strong character who was snarky at times but maybe just a bit too inquisitive. I really liked Tomohiro. He was a really enjoyable character who lives under a facade, to prevent people from becoming close to him and being harmed by the monster that he feels is within him. Katie makes some friends in Japan, Yuki and Tanaka, but they play very little part. They seem to be only brought into the story to serve another purpose. They're not well fleshed out and I didnt' build an opinion of them either way. But Katie makes another friend, with a guy she meets at the station, Jun. He is a mysterious character who I wondered about but liked, and who played an interesting part. Obviously, this book is not for everyone. In most reviews I've read, people didn't like that it had a lot of the usual cliches. Maybe it's that I haven't read enough of them yet, but they don't bother me or hinder my enjoyment. I really enjoyed this book and found that I didn't want to put it down. But if the cliches would prevent you from enjoying a book, then this one probably isn't for you.",Suzanne Finnegan
9781407109374,"""...I got through this book very quickly, as I did the others. Collins has a true talent for writing a hell of a page-turner...This kind of book is difficult to write a review of partly for that reason - I would hate to be less vague and inadvertently include spoilers, but trust me when I say that **** is going down all over the place here. Having read the book finally, I'm more excited to see how they'll present it all in the film adaptation - it is sure to be pretty visually dynamic. I am also NOT looking forward to the film adaptation, though, because I spent the entire last third of the book yelling OHMYGOD and weeping like a small, emotionally disturbed child...Mockingjay ended up being my least favorite of the trilogy, but that in no way means I didn't like it. I still think they're all phenomenal, and a great contribution to the dystopian sub-genre. Just, you know, if you're a total sap like me, maybe read it with a box of tissues handy or something, and not in the middle of the night if you live with someone who is a light sleeper, since you might wake them up with all the crying-out in shock and disbelief.""

9781407109374,"I know that many believe the first 'The Hunger Games' to be Collins' best work. However, whilst I loved that book, I tend to favour the concluding chapter that is 'Mockingjay'. Many reviewers would disagree, finding the story to be a little too long or dark or poorly paced. Whilst I can see their issues with the pacing, I found that the drawn out nature of the book really helped communicate the themes associated with war, violence and poverty. This book really brings all those dark realities, explored in the two previous books, to the forefront and bares them without shame. Katniss and other major characters are faced with the moral dilemma of war: they have to ask themselves what are they willing to sacrifice? what are they willing to do? who are they willing to become in order to win the war and is it even worth winning? The whole notion of rebellion and fighting for what you believe in is well countered with explorations of the disturbing elements of war; it isn't a heroic fable, it is a dirty and unkind struggle for truth and freedom. Collins' writing is easy but effective and she captures the issues well via the protagonist Katniss' own narrative. This book is confronting but not uncomfortable and is the strongest book in the series. Highly recommend.",H.

9781407109374,"Mockingjay is the final exciting instalment of the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. Katniss Everdeen, having survived her first Hunger Games and been plucked out of the Quarter Quell by the rebels living in District t13, is now required to become the symbol of the rebellion, the Mockingjay. But while her mother and her sister Prim were rescued by her best friend, Gale, her own District 12 has been destroyed and Peeta Melark is a captive of the Capitol. It takes a reminder of President Coriolanus Snow to cement her resolve to become the Mockingjay. But while the revolution gains strength, Katniss is torn by the number of people dying for the cause she is heading: she is beginning to wonder if the regimentation of District 13 and President Alma Coin are any better than the Capitol and Snow. In this thrilling finale, Collins uses her main character to comment on: the power of the media and those who control it; how circumstances can turn gentle people into warriors; how power corrupts; the futility of war; and how those who develop weapons have no control over how they will be used. Collins gives the reader believable characters and an electrifying plot with plenty of twists. This may not be capital L literature, but it is nonetheless a gripping and thought-provoking read.",Marianne Vincent

9781407109374,"This is definitely the heaviest and most emotionally-packed book of the series. It didn't have the contstant thrill of the first two books, but it was just as captivating. In the beginning, I was actually surprised by how, comparatively, light-hearted Mockingjay had started. In the first half it was full of little jokes and comical moments that lighened up the darkness of the events that were unfolding. A twist in the middle broke my heart. As I, as a reader, got more involved into what was happening in the war between the districts and the Capitol towards the second half, I kept wishing for a different turn of events, but Suzanne Collins didn't try to diminish the horror of war, and on the pages I saw a lot of pain, suffering, emotional wreckage, loss, death... And over all that, there is the aftermath of the Hunger Games the victors have to live and deal with. It left me emotionally drained, but I still love this book. I guess I love it because it is realistic. And thought-provoking. I wish this series never ended, but I know it will be a long time before I can get this story out of my head.",Alina Solomkina
9780545169189,"The List is an intimate look into the lives and minds of a group of teenage girls - each of them brings their own unique story and each have a different ending. To me, this book felt less like a journey (with a plot and clear story to tell) and more like an experience of juxtaposing these 8 stories. This is a particularly effective method to accomplish what I believe Siobhan Vivian is trying to do with the List, which is to highlight the struggles of a group of characters who are very different from each other. This is a book with a strong message, and I would highly recommend for readers who appreciate that type of story. Reasons to Read: 1. Effective multiple narrators: Narration with multiple perspectives can be pretty hit or miss for me, but I found it to be a particularly effective tool in The List. The multiple perspectives works well here because the reader is given a broader understanding of the 8 girls and their relationships with each other. The similarities and differences between the characters were striking. It was fascinating to discover this, especially while the girls themselves had yet to recognize their similarities. 2. A hard topic handled perfectly: To me, The List is definitely an ""issue book"" because there is a strong message within the story. However, the message didn't come across as preachy or pushy, which is a delicate balance to strike. It's very much present, and the ending leaves the reader with a few questions to ponder. Each of the girls has her own personal, unique ending - one that is suited to her character. This is important because it made the story feel very real - both endearing and heartbreaking, and even optimistic for some of the girls. But not all. A drawback from these two positive features is that the story largely feels unfinished. The book is simply too short to adequately wrap up the story of all 8 girls, and because of the sheer number of characters they don't get much page-time or development. Which is why I said that this didn't feel like a story as much as it felt like an experience or a portion of a journey. The List is a book that I think would make a great starting point for discussions with younger girls - perhaps pre-teens or teenagers. It could be a really great book club pick because there's so much to talk about here (or even for a mother/daughter read). And it works really well for that - as for enjoyment purposes, the story lacked the development I prefer to read about in books.

This book is suitable for readers who don't like long hours sitting and reading although it is so inspiring that will take over every kind of readers attention. ""Memories might keep him alive. But they might kill me."" Mystical story about passionate love and how that is ruined by ones death.

It shows affection and how sometimes the ones whom you trusted might just not be there when you need them the most. It's about understanding and misunderstanding, about relationships and trying to live on, to survive. I cried a lot reading this book. I usually put paper peaces between pages to find later on great quotes however I didn't put any in this book but not because there weren't good quotes but because there was so much good sentences that there wouldn't be any need to put paper in almost every page. Everything seems to be in order and even song titles are so right like they were written specially for situation not the opposite.

And being with a high school boy who is in a sports team and loves pranks between other teams, it's just a living hell. Lissa is sick of her boyfriend. Hamilton High is in war, a civil war! The football team versus the soccer team. The logic thing here would be to prank another high schools teams, but Lissa's school is different. Her quarterback boyfriend, Randy, is more interested in picking a fight with someone from the soccer team than being with her, alone, in the car (Hello? Since when?) or doing stupid pranks to them. And it's not nice that while you're intimating with your boyfriend, someone throws at your boyfriend's car eggs or something like that. Why should she compete with a bunch of sweaty and huge boys? She should have her boyfriend's attention. Girls before pranks! So Lissa plans to end up this stupid rivalry and make all the boyfriends from the teams, soccer & football, to choose girls over pranks. And what is it that boys love more than sports and pranks? Girls/intimacy/hookups. So Lissa convinces all the players' girlfriend to go on a hookup strike: the boys won't have any attention from their girls until the teams make peace. But what started with a healthy plan turns out to be a girl against boys war that hinges on who will cave to their libidos first. Lissa had no problem with that until Cash Sterling put himself in her way, tempting her and making Lissa want to forget about war. Review: We love Kody Keplinger's books. Our first ""Keplinger novel"" we read was Shut Out and we fell for it instantly. Then we trusted our reading hopes to The DUFF and A Midsummer's Nightmare and now we're waiting, anxiously for more of Ms. Keplinger's stories. This teen love story is refreshing and lovable. Lissa is a control maniac and she's kind of mature in some points of the story. She sees this war between teams of the same high school ridiculous and tries to end it. How? Well, girl power. Why not? We've heard it from Madonna's songs and other books that what a woman can do no one can. So she tries to use that advantage. Boys love girls and sex and kisses and all that. So a hookup strike is the best thing Lissa cames up with after reading a book hot, cute and good soccer player Cash gives her. But everything ends up in a sex war: Boys vs. Girls. And Cash leads the boys and Lissa the girls. We loved Cash. Randy was an idiot and a childish guy and we didn't like him. Not at the beginning and surely not at the end of the book. And then Cash appears in Lissa's life. It was so cute. And then we now that he always liked Lissa and that just melted our hearts and made us do a team Cash flag. This book is a perfect summer read and not just because the romance between the characters (all of them!) but because this is a story about war between sex, friendship, forgiveness and finding love in the unexpected places. If you love our summer reads, this is definitely one of them and all of Kody Keplinger's books.

The Review: Beautiful and deadly, Ridley Duchannes is a Dark Caster Siren. She can make you do things, even if you dona??t want to. When around her what you think and feel, cana??t be trusted, and never be stupid enough to tell her you love her. Wesley a??Linka?? Lincoln, never listens to anyone, especially Ridley when she tries to warn him off. After all he loves her. When leaving for New York, Link takes Rid with him on his dream to become a rock-star. Teaming up with a bunch of Dark Casters, he joins there rock group and scores big in a hot gig at an Underground club. Finally Links dreams are coming true. But nothing is as it seems in New York, where Mortals and Casters are in as much danger as each other. As for bad-boy club owner Lennox Gates, he holds secrets far greater than anyone else. His secrets are dangerous, and Ridley is in his sights. Determined to find out the truth, Ridley, soon discovers nothing is as it seems, and Link and her lives are on the line.

9780547417301,"This book isn't for sale in the uk and being a fan of witchcraft novels, this aroused my curiousity. Anyway if X-men Rogue had been an witch instead of an mutant, this would be the result. Tamsin comes from a family of witches whose class their witchery as talents... But for poor Tamsin, she grew up without one! Even after her grandmother made an prophecy at her birth that she was going to be the most powerful of them all. Anyway, while Tamsin works late at her family's witch shop, an stranger comes a-calling- and askes her to seek out an antique heirloom that has been missing for 100 years. She agrees. Then closes up shop to bike home to get ready for her family gathering... Enroute she runs a young man down and from that moment they both become embroiled in a web of cloaks & daggers, magical style which could result in all her magical clan disappearing in a Marty McFly(back to the future) situation. This book should be brilliant for a cinema kind film as it has it all!",DEENA M BRYANT
9782011554437,"I bought the Alter Ego Cahier D'exercises as the French course that I am doing uses the Alter Ego workbooks. The workbooks are quite good, however the Cahier D'excercises is almost pointless due to the fact that it doesn't have any answers included. If you are doing a French course which specifically uses the Cahier in class then it might be useful, but working through it at home is essentially answering questions blind without any hope of checking the answers. Wish I hadn't bothered buying it.",Darran Lowes
9781442445932,"Shannon Messenger. A name that you should get familiar with. She is an author, and a damn good one. Her first book - Keeper of the Lost Cities, published by Aladdin on 10/2/2012, is quite a wonderful debut. Chronicling the adventures of young Sophie Foster, whose world is turned upside-down in the Natural History museum, the book is a magical romp through a world of Ms. Messenger's imagination. No, no spoilers here - that's not fair. But I will say a few things. First, though this is aimed squarely at the YA market, I had NO issues with the writing style at all. It is, simply, well-written. It romps, it rolls, and it pulls you in in about three pages. Look, I'm a quick reader, but I finished this nearly-500 page book in less than two days (during which time I also did.. well, lots of other stuff). Second, the characters feel real. They are unique voices, consistent, and well-defined. And they don't read as 'stock' characters - although Elwin does remind me quite a bit of McCoy (though that could be my background bleeding through). Finally, and this is the big one for me - the dialogue WORKS. You have read my stuff - I do dialogue instead of narrative. It's how I write. And it's what I like to read. Well, I LOVE what Shannon did with her dialogue. It isn't forced, it isn't stilted - it flows and moves as real speech should and does. My ONLY quibble with the book is the setting of the academy for the world's kids. It feels too much like Hogwarts. Now, that isn't a terrible thing, and, given the heroine is a 13-year-old girl, I'm not sure HOW you could do a book without incorporating SOME kind of school, but it's the one bit that required a little extra 'suspension of disbelief.' That being said... Go get this book. And hope that she decides to write another (and another, and another...).",TheAdamG
9780755378968,"Favourite Quote: ""Sometimes not knowning was better. Easier. And maybe even safer."" This is a re-read for me and the first time I rated this book a 5/5 stars, however now a few years later reading it again, I give it a 3/5 stars! The main reason I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one was the plot! I felt this one was much less frightening and exciting, at least until the last couple of chapters! I also guessed most of the twists from earlier on which kind of ruined my enjoyment! But overall the plot was okay, but I hope the next book's is even better! Another reason why I dropped a star was Violet! The first half of the book I just couldn't connect with her. She was being childish, immature and selfish! So I never really liked her. Some of the decisions she made I felt were reckless and some I would never do, so again I couldn't connect. During the second half, she was okay again but I still don't like her as much as I did in the first book! As for the other characters, I loved Jay just as much as the first book! And the rest of the side characters were funny or interesting so that was a plus! Overall I didn't enjoy this as much second time round and the first is well better in my opinion! Neverless I will be continuing with this series!",brookexx
9780755378968,"Several weeks have passed since the incidents of THE BODY FINDER. Now that Violet and Jay have changed their status from best friends and to more than friends one could think their relationship wouldn't be intriguing anymore. Although they are together neither has lost his unique personality. Both protagonists develop new sides of their personalities and show that they can ,beside being together, still be two individuals. Kimberly Derting generously considered our demand for more Jay and Violet and wrote so many more exciting, romantic and steamy scenes that one has to love DESIRES OF THE DEAD only on their account. Violet is finally willing to explore the wide possibilities of her talent to sense the dead and Jay more than ever determined to protect her. There were times Violet annoyed me with her stoic and reckless behaviour, but in the end it were the conflicts, are always the conflicts that awake my interest. With the new case Violet is eventually thrown into and the involvement of the FBI, new dimensions of her ability are demonstrated. We get a glimpse of the working methods of the FBI and meet many new characters that communicate a different spirit than already established characters. We meet Sarah who works for the FBI and her assistant Rafe who is the most mysterious character in this series so far. Although Violet has a relationship with Jay there is something that also connects her with Rafe. He knows things he couldn't know and does things he shouldn't do. I sense a love triangle emerging and am really anxious to read about the relationship and feelings between the three of them. As I already stated I am team Jay , but I can't resist that pull to excitingly new character Rafe. I really want to find out what's the matter with him and which role he plays in Violet's life. He seems to have a special ability of his own and I cannot wait for Derting to reveal it. The new murder case is not the only criminal and immoral incident that is thematised. A new family has moved to town with a bunch of secrets in tow. I don't want to go into detail, you should find out yourselves. As in THE BODY FINDER Derting's writing is excellent and absorbing. She writes about the darker sides of life and the wicked thoughts of the human mind and is totally authentic and believable. Her language is rich, her characters are interestingly edgy and her story well-developed. The story is told from Violet's point of view on the one hand, on the other we also hear thoughts and witness actions of another narrator. This person is not as insane as THE BODY FINDER murderer, but sometimes just equally creepy. Derting plays with her readers and our loyalty towards Violet when applying a second point of view that is determined by the hatred for Violet and whose actions are directed towards the goal of Violet's destruction. I am more than thrilled about Derting's announcement of two more novels in THE BODY FINDER series and I am terribly curious to find out what happens next, which other bodies haunt Violet and if someone or somewhat could be able to come between this special something that connects Jay and Violet. THE VERDICT DESIRES OF THE DEAD can definitely fulfill the desires of every reader in search for a phenomenal novel with high creep 'n' cuddle factor!",MissPageTurner
9780755378968,"A great sequel to The Body Finder. I like it but wasn't really adsorbed into it this time around. Desires of the Dead somehow lacked the thriller-ish atmosphere I loved in the first book but nevertheless, Kimberly Derting still did manage to surprise me with the twist in the plot. I'm looking forward to read&learn more about the brooding and mysterious Rafe. I hope there won't be any love triangles. Please. It gets pretty tiring after awhile. I also hope we see more of Mike too *fingers crossed*. Poor Chelsea.",Joy Chuah Xin Yee
9780755378968,"I talked a lot about Jay in my review of The Body Finder and I'll probably do the same now... I love him! He is so utterly and unbearably perfect! I still love Jay and Violet's relationship in this book. I was sort of worried that it would be all cliched and that it wouldn't develop from the last book but I wasn't disappointed. It developed even more really well and seemed to be realistic and natural making it really believable which helps the whole story. I loved how one chapter leads to the next. There was a really nice flow to the story which made one event lead into another flawlessly. It definitely made this another unputdownable book. I read it entirely in two sittings it was that engrossing. The tension and suspense build up was excellent. It really sent shivers down my spine at times which is always a good thing! One thing I didn't really like though, was that the plot got a bit predictable at times. It wasn't enough to put me off, and even if I guessed what was going to happen I still enjoyed reading about it when it did eventually happen! I can only hope that more from Kimberly Derting comes soon!",Maryam H
9781405273411,"This is such an interesting and unique book. The narration style is fascinating, the plot is engaging, and the characters are dynamic. What makes this book stand out the most is the retrospective narration style. Austin is writing down everything that's already happened in chronological order, detailing both events he partook in during those weeks and what was happening at the same time elsewhere. Austin tries to be a brutally and painfully honest historian. He'll go from describing these interesting tangents about what he and Robby were doing in one moment to detailing what Robby's mom and his own parents were doing in that exact moment. It gives the story a full feeling, if that makes any sense. I loved that there are two equally distinct stories in this book, one of which is plot-driven while the other is character-driven. The whole end of the world story by deadly praying mantises is awesome. It's a science gone wrong story at it's finest and is wonderfully reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. The end of the human world by praying mantises is now one of my new favorite ways to image our end. But it's the character-driven parts of the story that quickly became my favorite parts while reading. At the core, this book is a coming-of-age story. Austin is in love with both a girl and a boy and is trying to come to terms with all of that. His sexual confusion is so realistically written that the reader feels his emotions with him. Austin and Robby's story is just so wonderful. I loved it. As much as this is a story about the end of the world by giant bugs, it's also a strong coming-of-age story about friendship, honesty, sexuality, and love. Now I know that this book probably won't be for everyone, but I highly recommend it. If you're into apocalyptic stories, anything Kurt Vonnegut-like, or offbeat coming-of-age stories, you should definitely check it out.",Ryann Dannelly
9781442402331,"This novel made it on my To be read list quite some time ago, and it's been out for a couple of years. Great news for me is that the following two novels are already out so I can pick this story up again any time I want. Excellent read to start out October, though it gave me a lot more than I expected. This is just not a novel of survival and kicking some zombie ass. There is a great story and a really deep, emotional storyline. This novel makes you go where you normally don't want to go as a reader of this genre.... giving the zombies a past and making you see them as once human. People that were loved, that once loved, that were fathers, mothers, children, husbands and wives. Once you allow yourself to see them in this light, it is so much harder to thirst for bloodshed - their blood to be exact. And that is the lesson that Benny Imura learns from his older brother. Though reluctant to see the 'zoms' any other way, he slowly begins to see what his brother Tom sees. With Benny's change of outlook, so does his life change. He begins to understand how deeply compassionate his brother is, and his eyes open to the injustices being done outside the safety of his sheltered little town of survivors. Not to mention, that he begins to understand just how amazingly formidable Tom is. Though this is a YA novel, don't think that you won't be kicked in the gut by this story. Not only did this novel make me feel sympathy for the one thing that gives me serious nightmares, but it also hit me on the emotional level. There is plenty zombie action to keep even the most hard core fan enthralled, but it also gives you a pretty original plot line and characters to keep you biting your nails to the very end. And an excellent ending it was. I can't wait to get into the next in the series.",Lily
9781442402331,"OMZ, Jonathan Maberry, you have truly outdone yourself - and while I wasn't in love with Patient Zero last year, I am tempted to camp out on your doorstep and beg you for more tales of the Imura brothers, the Lost Girl, and ye olde world of Rot & Ruin. I cannot believe I did not pick it up until now! This book is a MUST-READ. It reminds me of THE FIRST DAYS with a little touch of ZOMBIELAND and dash of The Forest Of Hands And Teeth. It was almost like Jonathan Maberry threw all the best things zombie and cooked up such a rich and brainy story to sink our teeth into. Delicious! f(0_o)f THE GOOD BITS {A dynamic love-hate relationship between brothers who lost their parents on the First Night.} Rot & Ruin chronicles the post-zombocalyptic world through Benny Imura's eyes as he reaches the age of ""adulthood"" (15). He blames his older brother for leaving their parents to die, and he has a blind hatred for zombies. When Benny is forced to shadow Tom to learn what happens in the Ruin, he has to face the possibility that all that he has been taught and heard may not be true - or humane. {Tom Imura.} I wish there had been a little more about him because his story would definitely be phenomenal. He is a zombie samurai who has a lot of honor and heart. As an older sibling myself, I could relate to Tom and all his burdens/responsibilities. Not to mention living with a brother who makes no effort to hide his disdain for your very existence. {Parts 3 and 4.} Holy fried brainz on a stick! LOVE LOVE LOVE. Action-packed, horror-filled, tear-jerked, surprise-ended, zombie-loaded :D Well worth the journey! THE BAD BITS {Misleading Zombie Trading Cards.} I don't know if the paperback version will have the awesome Zombie Trading Cards illustrations on the inside front and back cover, but I was looking forward to an encounter with ""The Bride Of Coldwater Spring."" She sounded delightful - and by delightful, I mean downright frightful! However, because of the cards, I had prepared myself for a completely different zombie story. Like Benny, I had imagined the glory days of zombie bounty hunters - taking down zombies like nobody's business! On the flipside, I am more than satisfied with the actual Rot & Ruin story! {The deaths of certain characters} ...whom I shall not name here, but dearly wished that they had not gone the zombie way. However, I think that this also drove home what Jonathon Maberry wanted to get across. Yes, we all love our zombies getting blown to smithereens, but have we gone a little kill-kill-kill-crazy? Let's stop and remember that zombies had family who might still be human. {The book ended.} Granted, I thought the ending was the most beautifully-crafted piece of work, but I was seriously distraught that the story ended there. So many questions, so many ties left undone, and so much more revolutionary changes to make! Thank goodness that DUST & DECAY has already come out because I don't think I can wait much longer to find out what happens next! THE OVERALL Absolutely a stunning piece of storytelling that shines a whole new light on zombies! I loved the way that Jonathan Maberry envisioned them and how that idea served as a way to bring brothers together after a tragedy that seems hard to forget and forgive. This would make an excellent movie with all the right sort of tension, excitement, romance, and humor! For a title like Rot & Ruin , this book has built such a strong, flavorful world where the sky is the limit.",theEPICrat
9780545425117,"Fantastic book, showcasing a creepy version of the future. The story captivates you from the first pages and doesn't let go. However, I must say I don't like the main character, Katniss. Her thoughts, her decisions... She keeps getting everything the wrong way, distrusting everyone. It is somewhat exasperating. But heh, who knows what we'd do in those circumstances. I suppose that's part of the charm of the book. I find myself caring for her and her friends and wishing for everything to turn out well.",Aby
9781595142900,"If I hadn't already read Strange Angels and Betrayals, I probably wouldn't have looked twice at this cover for Jealousy. Thank god I already was looking forward to the sequel, because otherwise, I would never have picked this particular book with this cover up. The book was good. I am really enjoying this series It's first person narrative, with just the right amount of angst, first love confusion and strong girl trying to stay strong. Normally, I have no patience with angsty characters; there are a few exceptions, but in general I'm not fond of angsty characters. Lilith Saintcrow is one of the few authors that can write angst and still keep me interested in her novels. It must be the combination of angst and kick-*** that works for me. I've put down other books with a bit less angst. Ms Saintcrow strikes the right balance with her characters for me. From the first book to the the third, there's only been a p***age of a few months - so Dru (main character) and Graves have been through quite a lot together in a short time. In the first book, Dru has to kill her zombified dad (hey - kill or be killed!) and through out the next few months has hardly had time to process this intense loss or the extreme changes that she's been through. Graves has had to deal with being changed into a wulfen, that's got to be tough for a teen boy. Jealousy deals with her delayed grieving as well as a whole slew of other mental leaps that Dru has to navigate. And Action - there's action as well - a couple of good fight scenes.Dru and Graves have finally made it to the Schola that she was originally supposed to go. But she's still in quite a bit of danger. She is one of the few female dhampir who have made it to the ripe age of 16, and the other female dhampir seems to have an unreasonable hate on for her....is it jealousy? Being the only female dhampir for years and years must make a girl feel very special, and now here comes Dru. Even though Dru and Graves are supposed to be safer now, Dru knows that she's still in danger. She can feel it. She's also been having a lot of flashbacks of previous scenes from her childhood. They all tie together by the end of Jealousy. There is an absolutely heartbreaking event in Jealousy - which I hope will be the focus of the fourth book. And one of Dru's enemies is finally dealt with, but there seems to be more. A few of my favorite characters from the past two books are still in Dru's life. Graves, of course; Ash the broken wulfen who seems to have formed an attachment to Dru; Dibs from the other schola (school) and Christophe. Although I have to admit here, that Christophe is not one of my favs. In fact, I find him, and his feelings for Dru just a bit creepy. He's way older than her, knew her mom and yet...Creepy. There are a few good things happening for Dru. Her relationship with Graves is progressing in a first love, awkward way. She's learning that she can make friends with some of the boys. She's learning a little more about her heritage, and putting two and two together - fitting some of the puzzle pieces of her past into place. I'm looking forward to reading more of Dru's story. I'd like to hear a little more about Graves and his past also. Lili St. Crow is great at painting pictures with words. She's very good with dialogue, especially the different speaking patterns of a young girl, a teen boy, the wulfen, and the rather stuffy dhampir who have ""been around"" for a while. She's one the authors that can write a story where you can just picture the teen really saying the words. The narrative is also something that I enjoy from Lili St. Crow. She's good at all the little details - such as the way the hair changes with the moods of the dhampir, the little sounds the come and go, the tastes and smells of things. I think the word I'm looking for is atmosphere - she paints a wonderfully atmospheric picture with her words",Mardel
9781408331569,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Hachette Children's Books and Netgalley.) A group of teens discover that after a flu jab, they can suddenly hear everybody?C/??s thoughts. Who has secrets that they need to hide from their friends though? How long will these abilities last? And is this new-found side effect a good thing or a bad thing? Oh dear, yet another pretty cover, with a not-so-entertaining story behind it. I felt like I couldn?C/??t really connect with the characters in this book, they came across as very immature and spent most of their time arguing with one another. I didn?C/??t feel like they really approached their problems in the best way, and the constant arguing (even if it was in their heads) got annoying quite quickly. The storyline in this should have been good, but instead became petty. Every tiny little thing was nit-picked, and the most anybody ever found out by listening to someone else?C/??s thoughts was that they were cheating on their significant other. I did appreciate how awkward it would be to overhear your parent?C/??s thoughts while they were having sex, and some other embarrassing situations, but most of the time the story just dissolved into petty name-calling, and making fun of people. I think what this story needed was a good old mystery. If there had been a murderer running round, and they could hear his/her thoughts, then that would have much improved the story, and given the characters something to actually think about other than who picks their nose, and who thinks they?C/??re fat. But unfortunately, nobody died. There was some romance, but not a lot, and it mainly consisted of people thinking about kissing other people. For pity?C/??s sake, if you know the boy is trying to psych himself up to kiss you, put him out of his misery and do it for him already! Especially if you want to kiss him as much as you seem to! The ending was okay, but I was glad that I had gotten to the end to be honest. I really didn?C/??t want to listen to their petty arguments any more. Overall; a little immature, and with too many petty arguments, 5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780312387969,"Zoey and her omnipresent struggle between different men and love interests came to an end when Heath died in the last part and saved me from starting to hate her for her naive and mindless behaviour. Now that her soul is scattered, Zoey only gets to tell the subplot. As we lost our heroine Zoey, the main plot is told from many different POVs, like Aphrodite's, Stark's or Heath's which is a very welcomed change. This novel is structured like a quest with the purpose to save Z's scattered soul from being lost forever. Stark is on a mission and we are with him, totally swooning for our brave and fearless warrior. Another plot point circles around Stevie Rae making friends with a creature of darkness. I know that they shouldn't be together or not even friends, but a forbidden romance makes the series more interesting and gives it a new exciting touch. Furthermore a new setting is introduced, the Isle of Skye, a Scottish realm of magic and ancient power. The Queen Sciach introduces another kind of vampyr to us, who only know the modern world. Stark has to travel a long way of pain and bearings to become one of them. All main characters have to go through a major change and are confronted with their worst fears. Zoey (finally) needs to let Heath go, Stark has to fight the dark powers within him and Stevie Rae her growing feelings for an evil and forbidden creature.

We've got action, a lot of tears and fears and of course a highly romantic love story. Burned will leave you on fire!",MissPageTurner
9780312387969,"I want to state first off, that there are a couple of misleading things in the summary. I didn't write the summary. My summaries will always be from the book itself, unless otherwise noted. So I just wanted everyone to know that this summary isn't exactly 100% truth. Alright, on to the review. One thing I liked about the previous novel, Tempted, was that it was written in differing point of views. This one made me happy because it too went back and forth between POV's, and even expanded the views to a few more characters. I've mentioned before that depending on the novel, I'm not a big fan of books jumping back and forth between POV's, but it definitely works for these novels (my husband, on the other hand, would disagree). In this novel, we delve a little deeper into the mythology and ""Otherworld"" of the HoN universe. I enjoyed this immensly because we got a chance to learn more about this world, the rules of it, and understand the deeper meanings behind certain things. On another good note, the characters really grow in Burned. No longer do they seem the teenagers that we've gotten to know throughout each novel, but now they seem a lot more mature and more like adults. Unfortunately, there was just something about this book that didn't hold my interest like the previous ones in this series. I found that I couldn't stay focused on it and, unusual for me, I was not constantly thinking about what was going to happen or thinking about grabbing the book so I could read some more. It didn't really take off for me until Chapter Twenty-Four. That was when my interested and curiosity peaked and it really started to get good for me. The end was touching, but predictable. I did enjoy this book though, don't get me wrong. But it definitely is not my favorite in the series.",Rainy Days and Pajamas

That is what Lily is learning about, where those shades of gray really turn into black and white. I think that is her biggest journey in this book. Lily and Scout crack me up- I love their easy relationship, Scout's sarcasm, and their dynamic. Both are shown to have flaws, and strengths in this book. But I would say that it falls somewhere in the second book syndrome. Sure, there were things to move the plot along, but I never felt like there was a set climax, or really much of a resolution. I want MORE. Both Sebastian and Jason are back in this one, and I am not really sure about either of them. Sebastian makes me wonder what all is really going on beneath the surface and is the epitome of gray to me. Jason is mostly a great guy but is hiding things.

9780375834691,"Huge thanks to the girl who sat next to me on the bus to Chicago from ALA. She had this ARC in her hands when she boarded the bus for our 3 1/2 hour trip home, and she finished it by the time the trip was over. When I asked how she liked it, she nodded, I believe, then swallowed a lump in her throat, and offered me the book. Once again, thank you! Do you remember where you were on 9/11? The characters in LOVE IS THE HIGHER LAW were all in New York City. So was David Levithan, and that experience was inspiration for this book. As Levithan points out in the Author's Note, many young people today may be too young to have first-hand memories of that world-changing day. By reading the experiences of Jasper, Peter, and Claire, perhaps the emotions of that day and its aftermath can be experienced by readers in the years to come. As the book begins, each character shares where they were and what it was like at the moment. Peter and Claire were affected immediately, while Jasper finds it difficult to admit that he slept through the actual attack and learned about it as he listened to Peter Jennings on the news. The personal experiences of the three become intertwined as the story continues. All three are surprised at how directly they feel the emotions of the event. The life they once took for granted, the city they've always known as home, and the atmosphere surrounding them have them asking questions that have no real answers. David Levithan captures the unique yet universal feelings inspired by the event that touched us all. Amidst the unanswered questions are feelings of greater appreciation for family and friends, the sympathy that goes out to those who lost and suffered most, and the human condition that connects the entire world. Unlike the teen who read the book in one sitting on the bus, I found the need to set it aside at times to sort through my own memories of that day and what has unfolded since. The world is truly a different place, and I've concluded I'm not sure if it is for the better or worse. Time will tell.",TeensReadToo

The author only recently passed away this March at a ripe age of ninety-something My only quibble is if it could've been longer and more detailed. This is the authorized biography also using the author (Bob Thomas's) interviews with the man himself and who was also able to access some part of the Disney Archives If you want a real, honest biography that is thoroughly engaging and does not do extensive psychoanalysis by an author who never met Mr. Walt Disney, nor is a psychologist nor even has an appreciation for animation (referring to them as 'animations') then don't get Neal Gabler's book, which Diane Disney Miller (who recently passed away, bless her soul) condemned it and was upset with the portrayal of her father If you want THE biography of Mr. Walt Disney, this is it. If you'd like more extensive notes, particularly on the production of those iconic feature animation films he made, Michael Barrier's book 'The Animated Man' is a great read too, but is more suited for the hardcore Disney fanatic.",PICK
9781416971757,"In Leviathan the story took place in Britain, Austria, Switzerland and for a majority of the time in the air but in Behemoth now that Alek and Deryn have met they continue on their journey on the Leviathan to the Ottomon Empire where Dr. Barlow's secret mission is finally revealed. Things never run smoothly when you're in the middle of a war however and before the two can set their eyes on their destination it's revealed that Britain is officially at war with Austria, pushing everyone to make difficult decisions. I have never read a book that was set in Istanbul, all of the historical fiction I've read has been set in Britain or America and all of the steampunk I've heard about seems to be set in Europe but Istanbul was a refreshing change of scenery and it was enjoyable to read about the hodgepodge of cultures living in this cosmopolitan. Behemoth is an altered history of course but from the author's afterword where he talks about what was true and what was changed I believe he remained quite true to the culture and feel of this country. The setting isn't of course what had me excited to read Behemoth, now that we've already been introduced to the world of Scott Westerfeld's Darwinist versus Clanker war we are delving further into the plot and after the events in Leviathan I was ready to see what else was going to happen to our brave protagonists. Deryn, the girl disguised as a boy in the Royal Air Service who continues to shine in dire situations, still hasn't told anyone her secret despite almost telling Alek in the previous book and this deceit wasn't a problem before until Alek started trusting Deryn with secrets of his own and now the guilt is getting to her. Alek, the Austiran prince on the run who continues to grow humble and independent, still has the German army looking for him. And even if they can't find him, now that Britain is at war with Austria he and his crew aren't too far away from becoming prisoners of war even if everyone on board the Leviathan aren't treating them differently (yet). Just like Leviathan there were no dull moments to be found in Behemoth and I chewed through this book in about half the time it took me to get through its predecessor (even though its longer). There were new beasties, clanker creations, dynamic characters, and a revolution. And of course there were the two main characters barreling down their own paths that at many times flowed together and other times (to my detriment) drifted apart. If Leviathan made me a fan, Behemoth made me obsessive and I desperately need the next book.",Sandy

9781416989417,"Hush, Hush is the first book in the series. The story focuses on Nora Grey who's life is pretty ordinary until a student transfers to her school, Coldwater High. Nora doesn't know what to think of the new boy ""Patch"" but definitely isn't happy when he becomes her new biology partner, separating her from her BFF Vee. Vee is a confident, chatty, daring, fun and caring friend. She is Nora's other half, they do everything together, and Vee makes sure there is plenty of mischief to keep us entertained throughout the story. Patch is Dark with mystery and handsome, he's annoyingly full of himself but leaves you wanting more, and that's just from meeting him the first time! Yep! Patch is trouble and Vee knows it, warning Nora to stay away, but will she? Hush, hush is just what I needed and more, after reading some poor reviews I thought ""okay let's not set the bar too high"". Well let me tell you, this book broke through the bar and ate it for dinner! It's funny, exciting, emotional, suspenseful so much so you won't want to put it down. Even now I've reached the end I just want to grab book two and devour it right now at 4am! If you haven't read it, why not give it a try, trust me you won't be disappointed, and to those who said they couldn't get into it, pick it back up right now, I know you will soon change your mind about giving that poor review:) I hope this review has helped you, can you please rate it positively if you liked it as it really means a lot to me, Many Thanks for reading:)",Sarah Martin
9781416989417,"Concoction of a Review: The day was gloomy at home. I looked at my shelves wanting to read something. *sigh* Nothing on one of my many shelves did not jump at me. I had the bulter ready the carriage to make a run to the libaray. Riding cloak in hand I was off. The library has the odd smell to it that only a book lover would enjoy. I took a deep breath and started to sally through the isles of inky wonders. I grabbed Hush Hush off the shelf not thinking it would amount to much but I wanted it. *Gasps!* Becca Fitzpatrick, I was not expecting what was between those covers! This was much more than I expected... in a good way. I even managed to get my own hardcover copy of Hush Hush for my favorite books of all times shelf. *sigh* It is the most beautiful sight! Now I have a lovely hardcover copy of Cresendo right along side of it. Which I hope to get to soon. Nora Grey, a sophomore seemed to be living a pretty wonderful life. Which included a truly grand friend, Vee. Those types of friends are hard to come by. They even endured Biology together. I know many groan at the though to of science but this was just a plus for me *grin*. Now us readers get a bit lucky and well, our duo have a stroke of discomfort when the dear biology professor decided to do the unspeakable. He made everyone change their lab partners, breaking up the girls. However, now Nora is now partnered with the mysterious silend badboy, Patch Cipria. From that moment, that little change her normal life was soon to be less then that. Everything starts to change.... Patch is one of those dark and brooding types that knows exactly what to say or not say to drive Nora to the brink of... lets just say he gets her all flustered and mad. Albeit her frustration with him she can't seem to stay away from Patch. It's a scary weird attraction she does not understand yet she is compelled by him. Nora is afraid to lust after him and she is just simply afraid due to a few mysterious occurances. There has to be something blasphemous about the possiblitiy of that relationship. The Mad Scientist really wanted to love him but he comes out as being creepy in the beginning, creepier then I would care to admit. But must admit I love the innuendos that come out of his mouth. I can just picture Noras knickers getting all twisted with her face all up in a huff of anger and embarrassment. It truly made me laugh out loud... more than once. Thanks to my dearest Becca for a darker male to swoon over, I needed that! Picture cloaks, magnification glasses, and proper pick locks because Nora and Vee do some investigation of their own which leads nowhere. Soon, her fear switches to Vee who gets herself into a scary situation without knowing it. Vee is alone with Elliot and Jules who are not exactly what they seem. Hush Hush was Becca Fitzpatrick's debut book, that made the Mad Scientist an instant fan! She has easily wiggled her way onto my favorites list and I can hardly wait for Crescendo to come out! Hush Hush was a fast paced page flipper. I personally could barely put it down! The story was I tense with well thought out plot twists. What I mean is, the Mad Scientist was guessing throughout the book instead of being told what I already figured out. Tis true, it is hard to out whit this brain. Overall, the Mad Scientist is more then pleasantly pleased. It was a wonderful read and a great debut novel!",Mad Scientist
9781416989417,"When I bought the book, I assumed that I would read something like Fallen by Lauren Kate. I was wrong and I have not regretted it at all. Mainly character of the book is the 16-year-old Nora. A quiet girl, not in an annoying way, which for me was easy enough to understand her and her feelings. Beside her is her best friend, her mother and later the other major character of the story, Patch, who is coming along with other mysterious characters. Apart from Nora, Vee and her mother all other characters are a real mystery and diverse enough to change their characters and the story. While the beginning of the book is Twilight alike, and we are in a biology laboratory with an obnoxious partner, then it's changing very much and I would put it far away from Twilgiht and the writing style of Stephanie Meyer. Personally, it is much much better. It's a pretty dark book, full of action, mystery and tension. On the one hand you had the peculiar relationship of Patch and Nora, from the other mystery of assassination attempts to Nora. Along with the Patch appear and others with fairly dark past and form. The best thing is that the book is not predictable. It is very difficult nowadays to find something really authentic and i believe that hush, hush accomplishes that part. Every 50 pages approximately when you think you have a conclusion to what is happening, something will happen and will change your mind again, but not in a way to be confused or tired with it. The characters are fairly comprehensive, and persons who remind you of people from your environment. Bad girls, cute guys and of course the bad guys who you really want to avoid or afraid. Of course there is an intense love story but is written beautifully next of all the facts and the history of characters without be too much. I believe it can be read easily enough from boys as well. Something might be worth to point out is that at some points (rather dark) were both well written and descriptive that scared me with the result of the scene to stayed on my mind for good. I think should begin to watch out the evening in the street. Also, something that really surprised me, is the fact that all the characters are used in the story with none of the mentioned people to staying out. Every single person which was mentioned has a role to play. Something that i can't remember if i have seen it in another books. If the books loses somewhere, then it is that missing information on angels. Apart from a posting a page that is supposed Nora would find, we did not learn much about them, although some conclusions are easy to get out. Overall, I enjoyed the book and I am especially glad that I chose it. The preview chapter of the next book which was included at the end, has made me want it even more since it appears that Patch has even more mysteries around him than you can imagine.",splashofourworlds.blogspot.com
9781416989417,"Right from the start, you were thrown into a mystery, which kept on building up then all of a sudden BOOM! everything is crystal clear right in front of you. Basically its a paranormal romance between angel and human. I dont want to get into details by explaining why exactly it's a ""forbidden romance"", because if i do then i'll ruin more than half the book. Just to let you know, there is a lot more than what meets the eye in this book. This book is VERY entertaining, partly for its humor. It got me LOL for most of the book(something that i never do in romance, since i m mostly in aww). Patch's character is soo hysterical, i found myself LMAO sometimes. For most of the part, i couldn't keep myself from smiling throughout the ENTIRE book; It has this effect on you. I constantly thought, '""Mahn Becca F. sounds like such a cool person for coming up with such humor"". Its a real page-turner(and i mean it!), again because of all the mystery. As you are reading, you think you got the mystery finally figured out, then OH! another twist in the plot. Gosh i LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! Like in twilight, Stephenie didn't keep the vampire secret hidden for very long because the story continues as a human girl in love with a vampire. Bella knowing exactly what she is getting herself into. This however is not the case in this novel. True it does have similarities to other paranormal romances these days. BUT, Becca does something different in this story: Nora falls for Patch without getting in on his secret. She actually falls for PATCH as a person, but because he is an angel *SPOLIER ALERT* (since she doesn't find out until the end). This novel is Mystery, Action, Romance and Fantasy all tied together in a beautiful package. If you are one of those crazyyy for paranormal romance type-of girls, then you will absolutely LOVE this novel. I think one of the best things i liked about this story is that it was very believable. Each and every character was relate-able. In my opinion, the best believable element was the Angel part, because angels are real(most religions believe in them, including myself). U read a vampire novel n fall in love with the story, knowing they don't exist and the story happening to you does NOT stand a chance. After reading this story, i got really interested in things we CANT see, but know that it exists. Made me look at the world from a different perspective. After i finished it in just one-sitting, i was like '""NOOOO!!, i can't be done this fast"" i wanted MORE nora and patch. The ending was good, very satisfying and couldn't have been any better. Although, it was sooo asking for a sequel. Angels are in, Vampires are OUTTTT!!! (and Its about time!)",JiYa
9781416989417,"This book was great. A romantic thriller with an angelic twist. Not that Patch is angelic, quite the opposite in fact. I loved the snarky dialogue between Nora and Patch. It was entertaining and felt right with the pace of the storyline. The writing was clear, well paced and succinct. A romance that was not overly superfluous! I loved it. I enjoyed the 'thriller' style of the book and didn't feel it was too scary, it just made me more curious to try and figure out what was going on. I was not able to guess one of the big twists until right around when it occurred which was great. Filled with banter, action, and surprises Hush, Hush is a book you don't want to put down. Look for the sequel Crescendo on October 19, 2010!",Scoot
9781416989417,"There may be a tad bit of spoilery below. Meet Nora. She is currently sitting in 10th grade biology with her best friend, Vee. They are starting the section on Human Reproduction! (Boy, do I remember those lectures!) when the teacher decides to break up the lab partners and seat them with someone entirely new. He wants to break up the familiarity so they can do some sleuthing and learn investigative skills. Enter Patch, a mysterious boy who no one really knows anything about since he hasn't uttered a word all year. The teacher instructs the new lab partners to interview one another. Nora introduces herself, and asks for his name. The minute he opened his mouth, I will admit it - I was in love! ""Call me Patch. I mean it. Call me."" Unfortunately, Nora finds this dude completely annoying and he rubs her the wrong way. He knows so much about her too, which makes her hyper-aware of his creepy status. By the end of class, she barely has 2 sentences written down about him, and he just walks out, ignoring her requests for more info. Later that night, she goes to find him for answers to their biology assignment, and he is just as elusive and frustratingly annoying! Nora continues on with life to find Patch right in front of her at every turn. Stalk much? Nora starts having the weirdest, scariest incidents happen to her, and after they are over, she can find no one who believes her because the evidence is completely erased! She starts to think she's losing her marbles, and wonders what Patch's role is in all of this. She really doesn't want to trust him, but he ends up being her savior every time. More characters are introduced, and people start getting hurt. However, the twists and turns are so good that it really keeps you guessing as to who is out to get Nora! Is Patch a trustworthy individual? What is his story, anyway? Who is Elliott, really? Why is Jules so quiet? Why the heck does Nora all of a sudden have a new school psychologist, with no communication from her old one? (Now that I think of it, what happened to him? eep!) Characters Nora is a well-behaved young lady who does her homework and her own laundry. She is a terrible liar, intelligent and a tad awkward. I found her pretty normal and not all that exciting. Patch is a snarky, sarcastic, uses major sexual innuendos in his conversations, has olive skin and dark curls. Be still my heart! However, he is also patronizing, aggressive, arrogant, and one hell of a manipulator, but he redeems himself, in a way only a fallen angel can. Kudos to Fitzpatrick's characterization! (Patch and Nora's relationship quickly reminded me of Jace and Clary from Mortal Instruments!) Irks: When is it ok for a 16 year old to stay at home alone most of the time? Nora's mom has a job that keeps her away a lot, and her dad is dead. I know that Dorothea, the housekeeper, comes by daily to cook, clean, etc, but she never stays over night, and this is absurd to me! Who lets their 16 year old have free reign like that? Can you imagine what kind of trouble and mayhem a teenager could get into? When I think back to my adolescence, this part of the story becomes a bit laughable and unrealistic. In relation to the above, Nora may be a good young lady who behaves, but in my opinion, she has way to much freedom. Maybe I'm overreacting, but she pretty much tells her mom the things she wants to do. Granted, her mom gets angry with her on a few occasions and acts like a mom would, but it seems unrealistic. And yes - I know this book isn't based on reality, but Nora is supposed to be an average teenager growing up in America. One more thing: Why didn't she ask for Patch's real name after that flashback with Rixon? Maybe I missed something, and Rixon was just kidding about that, but seriously? I would want to know! Vee = LAME! Conclusion: 4 out of 5 stars! You never know when you're going to fall in love, and it is likely to happen when you least expect it. This happens to both of our main characters, and it certainly derails the hell out of Patch's plans. While I devoured the entire book in 24 hours, I must take into account the few irksome bits mentioned above. Look forward to Crescendo!",Smash Attack

Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down. Kaylee is a great narrator of the story. And Nash is the very key for understanding the story.

9780373210039,"Kaylee Cavanaugh has a big secret. One that already led her to a mental institution after screaming like crazy in the middle of a shopping mall. But somehow she knows she is not nuts. She knows, deep inside her, that she feels something when someone is about to die... Or at least that's what she needs to believe because the only other option is just too frightening... Her questions finally get an answer from the most unexpected person: Nash Hudson, the handsome and popular guy at her school who knows everything. Despite her initial doubts about him, Kaylee decides to risk it after Nash, in the middle of a meltdown, helped her control the scream that was trying to escape her mouth. But her premonitions will come very handy when she learns that there's some kind of problem going on: the teenager she saw while talking with Nash at the bar is dead and she knew it was going to happen... and now another teenager just drop-dead too out of nowhere. Could it be possible that she can prevent them from dying? How can she do it when the only thing she does is scream her heart out every time she is close to them?! Now there's only two questions left: is Kaylee ready to learn the truth about herself? Does she understands that by learning the truth a whole new world full of danger, premonitions and new questions will emerge? Most importantly, is she ready to meet Tod? Personal opinion: Where to begin with? I think I'm still too amazed to be able to offer an impartial review. That's how GOOD and AMAZING it was. The whole concept that the soul songs encircle is so... romantic, so personal and sweet that it makes me smile; and that's the only little spoiler you are going to get from me, hopefully it will make you want to know what I'm talking about. But first things first. The mythology surrounding My Soul to Take was not only refreshing but also perfectly developed and told. I've read already too many books about angels, werewolves and, obviously, vampires; and although I'm not going to stop reading about these amazing creatures I have to admit that the world Rachel Vincent has created captured me from page one. Kaylee's screams make me ache for her, make me want to give her a tight hug and help her believe she wasn't crazy. But most important, I can't even explain how much I liked her strength and courage during the whole book. Now she only needs to improve her low self-esteem a little bit. Now for the romance part of the book I have to admit -hands down- that Rachel did an amazing work. I mean, I can't even think of choosing between Nash or Tod. I may need to read more books or I may never know who to choose. So far all I can say is: Can I keep them both? Because together they would be the perfect combination. In one side we have Nash, the handsome guy at her school that begins to talk to her for no apparent reason and guides her through her fears out of pure kindness. He is just too caring, sweet and hot. Then we have Tod, the Tod I've been hearing about a lot and now I understand why. He is the bad-sexy-dark-handsome guy who has a soft spot that only shows to Kaylee.

But anyway, I should of known this would be a great series. I've read the first two books in Vincent's Adult Urban Fantasy Shifter series. If you haven't read them or heard of that series yet, you should definitely look it up. They are good. This is a great start to this series. The character's are well developed. I really liked Kaylee and Nash. Those were my two favorites characters. Wait, I can't forget Tod! I haven't decided who I like better yet, Nash or Tod. Hmm. Kaylee seemed like a normal teenager, except for the whole knowing someone is going to die a few minutes before they do. So that was really good. I love when writer's can do that, make someone seem really normal without knowing their secret and when you do it comes as a surprise. You know what I mean? I was hooked from the first chapter, and the writing kept me reading and reading and reading. Ha! Overall, very, very interesting read! I was sad to see the first book end, especially without having the second. I'll definitely be trying to get my hands on the second book very, very soon. Vincen't has made it to my author's to look out for list. I'm really interested in checking out her other adult series as well. I really like the cover for this book.

Who will die next? Only Kaylee knows for sure. Wonderfully written characters that are portrayed as typical teenagers that possess extraordinary powers. A fast-paced, engrossing read that you won't want to put down. A story that I wouldn't mind sharing with my preteen, although she'll have to wait until I am done. MY SOUL TO TAKE is a wonderful beginning to a series that fans of Ms. Vincent's adult SHIFTERS series will definitely be rushing out to buy. A book like this is one of the reasons that I add authors to my auto-buy list. This is definitely a keeper. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780224021234,"Poor John. In ""Swallowdale"" he nearly ruins the summer by sinking the ship, and in this book he forgets to lengthen the anchor cable as the tide comes in, resulting in a ship adrift in fog in the harbour. The only way out ... was out. Though he does seem to have a knack of making mistakes inshore, this book is John's book. In no other book in the series does he come quite so much to the fore, and the book reaches its emotional climax when his father quietly says ""We'll make a seaman of you yet, son."" This the only book in which the Swallows are the only children to share in the adventure. Titty, strangely, is a secondary player. Roger has his moments, and Susan is exposed as a fairly vapid, thinly-rendered character whose main purpose is to worry unnecessarily. One is left with the suspicion that Ransome didn't much like her, but needed her in order to make the storylines more plausible. After all, someone has to do the washing up. I won't ruin the plot for new readers - suffice it to say that the children, through a series of mishaps, end up at sea in a small cutter, heading from Harwich in England to the other side of the North Sea. The pace of the story is maintained well, and one is only required to suspend disbelief occasionally, in non-obtrusive ways. Needless to say, the children make it across - and back - safely. One interesting thing to note is that this book is set six months after ""Winter Holiday"", just a few weeks after ""Pigeon Post"" and immediately before ""Secret Water."" One is left surprised that the children had any resources of resilience left to draw upon by the end of Secret Water! As always, this is a thoroughly good read, made no less so by the passage of eight decades.",Anthony Marinac
9780316014564,"I enjoyed this book. SWEETHEARTS is a character-driven novel where there isn't much action but a big emotional journey with quite a kick. Jennifer Harris is a social outcast. She is fat and the other girls in third grade are very mean. She eats lunch alone until the day that she decides to make Cameron Quick her friend. After that, she and Cameron are always together, both of them outcasts. Then, one day Cameron disappears, and the other kids tell her that he is dead. The book then forwards on to present day and Jennifer has recreated herself. She is pretty, popular, has a cute boyfriend, and has changed her name to Jenna. She is a senior but she feels like she is just acting a part. It takes a lot of energy to be the girl that she is. Enter Cameron Quick -- who she thought was dead. He reenters her life and the past comes flooding back in big waves. They reconnect and discover what real love is all about. I liked the fact that this relationship between Cameron and Jennifer was real but not sexual. In fact, when she does have sex with her boyfriend she feels unconnected to him. This love is not about sex but about experiences that will live within you for a lifetime. It rushes in and takes over. The characters of the story were real and you truly wanted to be their friends. I especially liked Jennifer's dad. He was someone that I wish I could talk with for hours. The book is also one that doesn't have a definitive ending. I kept thinking up fun endings for days afterwards.",TeensReadToo
9780758294395,"3.5 I wanted to read Sacrifice because I have loved getting to know the Merrick brothers in this series. They all have their own personalities and stories as well as girls that they are in love with. But as brothers there is always the element of family and the fact that Michael helped hold them together as the oldest after their parent passed. The paranormal magic in this one is also neat, learning about each brother and Hunter's powers and how they work together. There has always been someone to oppose them though, which has added plenty of tension and action to the stories. It was nice getting back to the world and into the head of Michael. He shoulders such a load because he has taken over guardianship of his brothers, and he wants to be a good role model for them and be there for them. In this book his livelihood, his home and sense of security in a lot of ways is ripped from him. He becomes a suspect in fires and other disasters that center around him, and I feel so much for him. He has to keep their powers a secret, and there are lots of things pointing at him as a possibility because of his and his brother's elemental powers. We also get the point of view of Hannah, Mike's girlfriend. She has her son, and she's a fire fighter. Her dad is the marshal, so there is plenty of pressure on her in a male dominated work environment and such shoes to fill. Then as Michael is under investigation she believes to much in his innocence but has to admit that the obvious signs are pointing to his involvement. I liked her strength and loyalty as well as her responsibility. he has a son and she tries so hard to be a good mom to him even though she had him earlier in life than most. While I liked Michael and how much he is willing to do to protect his brothers and to be there for everyone. He is fiercely loyal and has so much that should be so drool worthy, this wasn't my favorite of the Merrick books. I did like his connection with Hunter and how we get to learn more about him. There is also a surprise ally that was neat to get his perspective and how much he stepped up. There was a lack of his other brothers though. They weren't on the scene as much and even though there was a lot of Michael and he learned to accept some help after so much trying to be strong. I totally wasn't prepared for it to end where it did, because my kindle told me there was still a good 30% left, but it is the novellas included. So, yes, I did like where this one stopped and how things were resolved for now, I just was surprised and geared up for more. Bottom Line: Solid book moving the action and plot along. .",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)
9780758294395,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Kensington Books and NetGalley.) This was an interesting end to the series, and it was good to see things from Michaela??s point of view. Michael was stressed in this book. He was constantly on edge, constantly feeling like he was being hunted, and fighting a losing battle to keep his brothera??s safe. Things just seemed to go from bad to worse, and it seemed like the odds were really stacked against him. I felt really sorry for him with everything he had to go through, especially when he felt like he had no support at all. The storyline in this was pretty good, and there was certainly an undercurrent of danger running through it. There seemed to be quite a few twists thrown in, and a couple of unexpected deaths, which were pretty shocking! Things just seemed to get worse and worse for Michael and his brothers, and things certainly looked worse before they looked better. These guys seemed to lose everything as the story progressed, and the story really was traumatic for the Merricks! There wasna??t really much romance in this one, which was a little disappointing, but at the same time I feel a bit like the romance wasna??t really necessary. I think a lot of romantic interludes would have detracted from the danger in the story, which wouldna??t have been good. The ending to this wasna??t what I expected, but it was a good ending, and I really hope that everything will be good from the Merricka??s from now on! I did feel a little let down by how open the ending was, but maybe the author will revisit the Merricka??s in the future? Who knows! Overall; good end to the series, 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781442409071,"Also reviewed on my blog, The Vintage Bookworm (www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com) So some of you may know that I read Wither pretty late. I didn't read it until May! I instantly fell in love though. I quickly ordered Fever after finishing, but sadly I didn't start it right away! Other books got in the way and I started it twice I think, but then had to read other books again and it drove me nuts! Fever picks up where Wither left off, with Rhine and Gabriel on the run, but as soon as they think they are safe they fall into another place they will need to escape. Not going to go into too much detail as I don't want to give anything away. But that frustrated me to no end! It was seriously a *headdesk* kind of moment. I had very high hopes for this sequel. And I was right, never had any doubts about it. Lauren's writing is just one that you know won't let you down. And this world is so awful, but so interesting and real. It's really scary to think this could be the future one day! What will happen if something like this is what is going to become our future? Our children's future? It's just so scary to think about. And the writing is just so beautiful as always. You fly through the pages so fast and the descriptions are perfect and so detailed and you picture everything. EVERYTHING. It's amazing. And the characters....gosh. Rhine is so unbelievably strong and brave. She doesn't give up! She keeps going no matter what obstacle falls in front of her. She keeps fighting. I admire that SO much about her. She's such a great character and even though she's a fictional character in a dystopian novel, she's REAL. And Gabriel, oh Gosh, Gabriel. I'm so happy he's in this book every moment. I loved him so much in Wither and couldn't get enough of him. You learn more about him in here and he goes through a lot too and you just get to see Rhine and Gabriel's relationship blossom and see them take care of each other and I was always going, ""Awwwww"" at them because they are seriously cute and I just wanted to hug them! Overall, I loved this book. I'm dying to read Sever, ESPECIALLY after that last sentence of the book. I mean WHAT?! I was late reading Wither, so I didn't have to really wait for Fever, but Sever is 4 months and some days away. I'm DYING for Sever so bad. If you haven't read this series, you need to. Hopefully you aren't reading this if you haven't read Wither, but READ. NOW. I HIGHLY recommend it.",Amanda
9781442409071,"I was quickly reminded how much I love the characters, Destefano's writing style, and the chilling world that she has created. I've been eagerly awaiting this book, and it didn't disappoint, and I am just as on the edge of my seat for the 3rd one as I was for this one. If anyone thought that Rhine's freedom would be easy, they will be deeply disappointed. But I loved following their journey, even during the hard parts, because I love Rhine's undying spirit, her loyalty to finding her brother, and how much she is a fighter. It was emotional as she realized how much she really missed her sister wives, and even how Linden stayed in her heart. Her feelings for Gabriel are still there, but they still really don't get a chance to bloom because of all of their difficulties. I think, like Rhine, I really appreciate the freedom of choice here--I don't think they are in love, but I'm glad they're able to support each other, see if love blooms. I think that her feelings for Linden grew more than she wanted to admit, and I kinda wish that her and Linden had a chance to figure it out without the weird love triangle (was square I guess with Jenna, and I don't even know what you call it if you figure in Rose...) but I also don't want Cecily to be abandoned. So, if I as the reader can't figure it out and see the obvious answer, then I can only imagine the turmoil in Rhine, and that it really must be easier to try to forget/ignore the feelings for Linden. And that is not even factoring in Silas--but I can't really get too much a read on their dynamic. I def liked his character, and hope to see him again. Destefano really knows how to torture her characters, and its hard to read, but it is awesome how they grow and change. As well as what their suffering and trials make me feel. I have no idea what is next for them, but I am dying to find out.

9780061726804,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/review-before-i-fall-by-lauren-oliver/ I'm usually not the biggest fan of fantasy books that don't fall under a certain genre - whether it's paranormal/supernatural, magic/witchcraft, fairytale, or whatever. But surprisingly, I really liked Before I Fall. The protagonist, Samantha (Sam for short), is one of the popular girls. She and her three best friends - Lindsay, Ally, and Elody - are the girls that everyone envies. They're the trendsetters. They're the first ones picked on teams. They're the people that everyone wants to get goody-goody with. But then Sam dies. In a car accident coming home from a party, she loses her life and is forced to relive the last day of her life possibly forever. But as each day passes (with an almost identical routine), she learns more about herself, her friends, and a girl who could help her out of this mess. I'm really not the biggest fan of Sam. Her original personality - kind of stuck up - turned me down. But after her death, she started to learn more about herself. Who she was. Or who she should be. It made her a better person, more concerned about others, more caring. It changed my opinion of her immensely. Her character development was a huge part of why I enjoyed this book so much. But another reason I enjoyed this book? I adored the romance. Sam falls for a guy called Kent, who is one of the sweetest guys you'll ever meet. He's sensitive, kind, caring . . . and he's that for everyone, not just Sam. Pretty much everything girls want in their dream guy. (Sam is so lucky. Well, I mean, if she wasn't dead.) Before I Fall was a fantastic novel, with its sweet romance and redeeming ending. The romance and plot kept me on edge at all times, and its ending put a smile on my face. I would recommend it for teenagers - or even adults - trying to find their true selves.",Linda
9780061726804,"The story of BEFORE I FALL is set over a period of seven days and at the same time this story is one day replayed seven times. Doesn't sound that exciting to relive one day over and over again huh? But it definitely is! BEFORE I FALL shows how actions can change the outcome of a day and a whole precious life. It was all about the same characters, dialogues and events, but still every time Sam's day started the replay function I couldn't wait to see what had changed and what new was about to happen. Although it was only about that one day, each new replay holds another worthy and important revelation. It wasn't only the story which held me captivated but the character cast as well. BEFORE I FALL is told from Sam's point of view and the chapters are divided into the seven days replayed. Sam is a person that goes through enormous changes in just a short time span. And she is one of the much loved YA characters that achieve progress (which is ironic, cause she is stuck in that loop). She learns from her mistakes and learns how to become a better friend, sister, daughter and person in general. Sam learns how to find her true self and to appreciate every single moment, her family and friends. BEFORE I FALL also has romance. One of the most beautiful and saddest I've read about, which stunned me because it is rather subtle and doesn't dominate the story. Sam falls in love with someone she wouldn't have expected to like that much once she only got the know him. Find out yourselves about his cute and caring character. You'll love the mystery lover!! Fascinating is to see in how far one slightly different action or dialogue can change the entire day and also Sam's relationships with several people. The way they interacted and fitted into the construct of that single day really got my attention. Lauren Oliver's words and the uncertainty of the ending made me cry buckets. All the time I couldn't imagine how the story's going to end and the end definitely came with a surprise. BEFORE I FALL is the second novel by Lauren Oliver that I read and another that made me cry. Lauren Oliver has such a wonderful talent. Every single of her words is simply beautiful, each character like a friend and every new book by Lauren one I don't want to miss! THE VERDICT It's the story of a girl on the verge of dying that will definitely have its readers crying buckets. BEFORE I FALL is a magical read about the possibilities of life, the comfort of love and the transience of existence.",MissPageTurner
9780061726804,"Okay, so, the synopsis of this book was VERY interesting. But reading it, was kind of boring. I mean, it started off reaalllyy good. But then, after she keeps repeating the day of her death, it kinda made me feel like im reading the SAME thing over and over. BUT things start to change after her fourth or fifth day. Which is funny, because she does some crazy things that make me laugh my butt off. hahah. Anyways, in the beginning of the book, Sam and her friends were PISSING OFFF! They were those type of girls who would just party party party, make fun and bully other people, and just dont give a damn about anything but themselves. That pissed me off and i didnt really like them that much. But Sam changed and i loved her in the end. The author always shows that they are really close friends, but since they ARE, i dont know why they arent honest with eachother. For example, Lindsey can be VERY bossy. And if one of the girls do something she doesnt like, she makes fun of it and even spreads it all over the school. I mean cmoon, if you think horse riding isnt cool, but your friend likes it, deal with it. Now the boys, Rob was okay. But i sometimes felt he was too much of a show off. And sometimes he can get really naggy too. Since im an artist, i LOVED Kent. I fall in love with any boy who draws. (haha) But really i think its soo cute when he drew Sam that cute cartoon with her rose. ADORABLE. Okay in the end, it was a good book. True, it would be annoying sometimes, but it made me laugh and was funny too. Honestly, in the end, im not even sure if she DID die or not.

9780061726804,"What would you do if you knew it was your last day to live? What if you had the chance to do it over and over again? Would you change your actions and your way of thinking? In BEFORE I FALL by Lauren Oliver, Samantha Kingston has the chance to do just that. She is killed one night in a car accident, but wakes up the next morning, only to find that the day is happening all over again. She soon learns that just one little change in her actions can alter how the rest of the day goes, not only for her, but also for those around her. When I read the summary of BEFORE I FALL some time back, I knew instantly that I wanted to read it. And once I got the book, I couldn't wait to start. But I quickly started thinking that I made a mistake. I didn't like Sam, the main character, AT ALL! I thought she and her friends were self-centered, and annoying, and not at all what high school was like. I was about to stop reading the book, which I never do, when I decided to go read other reviews online. Many of the other reviewers mentioned how they didn't care for Sam, either, but continued on and ended up loving the book. So I decided to continue reading. And thank goodness I did! Throughout the story, we see Sam do a complete one-eighty and turn from an annoying, selfish, immature teenager into a young lady who realizes that she can help change someone's life. I loved how each day, Sam figured out how just one small action would cause a completely different reaction. And I really liked Kent. He seemed so sweet and was always there for Sam. The ending of the story really pulls at your heartstrings. It's sad but in a happy way, if that makes any sense. This novel makes you realize that life is short, and your actions regarding yourself and others have consequences that you might never imagine.",TeensReadToo
9780061726804,"At the beginning of this book I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. Written in 1st person narrative, Sam starts of as unlikeable; popular by association basing her actions and preferences on being accepted by the 'in' crowd. Peer pressure is an incredibly powerful thing and shown in all its *glory* in this story, the I felt as if Sam had no personality of her own, for all intents and purposes she was a sheep. And then she died. Initially, I thought it was like an emotional Groundhog day (which is even mentioned within the narrative). However, as I relived each last day with Sam I really felt for her. Sam's fear of dying was palpable within the narrative. Very, very powerful writing. I felt as if I was there with her every step of the way. Imagine reliving the day you die over and over again, knowing that it is inevitable; that here is nothing you can do to stop it from happening. Knowing the exact time, place and circumstance of your own death. How frightened would you be as the minutes ticked away. As Sam relives the same day over and over, we are exposed to the 5 stages of grief, (Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and finally Acceptance). Sam is grieving for herself not only for the life that she has yet to live but for the mistakes she has made so far. Getting the opportunity to repeat the same day gives Sam a chance to rectify some of the mistakes she has made. The opportunity to see people in a different light, to say the things she always wanted to say but never felt it was the right time and to be the person she really wanted to be rather than conforming. Sam gains a whole new perspective and discovers true love in the process. All the characters were well developed and almost 3 dimensional, there personalities and interactions were so real to me I felt I was there right along with Sam. I could relate to all of them in one way or another. The narrative incorporates a lot of sensitive issues such as substance abuse, sex and eating disorders; issues although not dealt with in depth reflect the inner turmoil people suffer while projecting a very different outward image. The saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' strongly applies to the characters within this book. I finished reading this book very late in the night; I went to sleep thinking about it and woke up the next morning still thinking about it. Is is one of those haunting stories that stays with you. For me it was an emotional roller-coaster. I felt as if I had been swallowed whole, chewed up into one big gloppy mess and then spat back out. I have to admit to absolutely sobbing my heart out while reading this one (not the usual silent tears but the gasping, sniffing type of sobbing). It really is an amazing book, you will need a lot of tissues.",Emma Davies
9780061726804,"In this book we see seven diferent versions of the same day. Even if it might seem repetitive its not because the subtle changes and the big ones make the book very enjoyable. There are also many things that get explained along the reading, and something never happens twice the same way. Its really incredible how the author wrote this book and succeeded in making a very good story. At the beginning you wont like the main character at all, mainly because shes very mean with everyone except her reduced group of friends. But as the story progresses she realizes that life is short and is meant to be enjoyed. I likef the fact that it's not the typical YA novel where everyone and everything ends happily ever after.

She's also a girl who escapes to the waves in avoidance of one horrific night that won't leave her memory. Since that traumatizing event, she's shut off her family and friends. She's quit school and moved to another town. Surfing is what keeps her sane now. Riding the waves alone is what her purpose has now become. All of that changes when she meets a fellow surfer boy by the name of Ryan. He's mysterious, yet calm. He's the one to make contact first with her, and little by little she starts to shed her outer shell and let Ryan in. Life has become easier by avoiding her past, and pretending it never happened, until Ryan discovers the secret she's kept buried for so long. Carly's fears are churning inside her on the brink of over flowing. She's not quite ready to deal with the reality of what had happened, and like before, her instincts kick in to retreat back inside her shell. This is a story about over-coming obstacles we battle within ourselves. Every one has personal demons, whether they're caused by someone else, or inflicted by our own doings -- they are there. We can choose to bury them, like Carly did, letting them eat at us from the inside out. Or we have a choice to deal with these demons, no matter how unbearably difficult it may be. If we're lucky, we'll find people like Ryan along the way to help us see the beauty that still lies inside us. This novel weighs heavy in my mind, and in my heart. It's the raw, vulnerable words that have stirred something inside me though.

9781416971733,"This was such a fun, adventurous read. My first venture into the steampunk genre and it did not disappoint, of course, Leviathan is written by Scott Westerfeld so I had little doubt that I would not enjoy this book and enjoy it I did. Like a well written high fantasy I was completely mesmerized by the sci-fi world of the book as I read through the pages of Leviathan and eyed the wonderfully detailed illustrations by Keith Thompson. And what was more fantastic in my opinion was that this wasn't a high fantasy world completely made up by the author but a world that was melded into an already existing history. An altered history filled with fantastic creations made of either machinery or fabricated animal. It's the Summer of 1914 in a world where countries are divided into Darwinists, who have war machines created from genetically engineered animals and Clankers whose machines run on oil and steam. Each side opposes the choices of the other but none of this posed a problem until the murder of Alek's parents, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie plunges the world into World War I and Alek is on the run for his own life. And while he tries to escapes from Austria to neutral territory with the chosen men Alek's father trusted with his safety, across the sea ready to take her Midshipman test is the nervous Deryn Sharp, the test isn't what has Deryn nervous however. While Alek has to keep himself hidden like a secret, Deryn has to keep her own gender a secret from the Royal Air Service just so she can fly through the skies like her brother. Both of these characters were such great reads, both were unique in their voices and situations but both were also so wonderfully alike in their ability to adapt and react in tough situations, their ingenuity, and their young wild hearts. Deryn who was advised by her brother to ""not stand out"" does everything but this because she really is a brilliant airman and it's just unfair that she has to hide who she really is to do what she loves but that doesn't get her down. In fact she hardly even thinks about it and I was happy this book wasn't filled with ""almost being caught"" moments but showed us all what Deryn was capable of. From her abilities to her colourful dialogue and voice Deryn quickly made her way onto my favourite female MCs list. Alek, I didn't love him as instantly and I was afraid in the beginning that I wouldn't love him as much as Deryn because he really does come off as spoiled prince but a quarter of the way through the book I quickly grew to love him too. As I said, he knows how to adapt in a tough situation even if he can't stop himself from acting like a young prince, throughout Leviathan Alek really grows and develops into his own person and changes from the boy playing with his toys on the first page. And it's not just these two who were great there were so many wonderful secondary characters that talking about them all would take too long but let me just say that they are all fleshed out and add such vibrancy and depth to this book. Mr. Westerfeld really did a great job of voicing the people to tell his version of World War I. Also, if you don't know the history of what happened in the war it's laid out for you with ease and without horrid info dumps so you will be neither bored nor lost. In fact there wasn't a dull moment to be found in this read and I am sorry to be joining the fandom so late in the game.",Sandy

In Long I have heard many great things about Paige Toon and have since wanted to read a book by her. After finishing and adoring The Accidental Life of Jessie Jefferson I couldn't believe I had left it so long to read a book by her. Paige's style of writing is one which makes you relax into the book really easily and quickly. It's one which makes you, as the reader, really feel like your there with the characters. So many times I found myself completely lost in Jessie's world, I never wanted to put the book down. I once even woke up to find I had fallen asleep reading because, despite having been so tired, I didn't want to put it down. There is a sort of charm about Toon's writing and characters which drew me in right from the beginning. Jessie is really likeable despite her attitude; I mean what teenage isn't like her at some point? I actually admired how she handled the situation and different things she had to overcome. I can't compare Paige's chick lit books to this YA book as I haven't read any of her other books. However I can tell you,without a doubt, that Paige has written an addictive YA book which is well paced and addictive not just at the end but throughout the book.

9781250027382,"Post-apocalyptic novels have been the 'big thing' in YA literature for a while. Generally speaking I quite enjoy the genre but with so many stories out there it is hard for something to stand out from the pack and that was Monument 14's big problem. Despite having a good storyline, good characters and being written well this book just got lost in the never ending pool of other YA dystopias to me. It wasn't interesting enough and it wasn't different enough to make it stand out. Monument 14 is an easy read, it starts quickly and maintains pace all the way through. I found it enjoyable and it entertained me but I couldn't help but want a little more. Hidden in the wings this book has some serious potential I liked the idea of teens being stuck in a shopping mall and having to look after children as the world crumbles around them. There was room for a hell of a lot of depth, there could have been sad moments, joyful moments and moving moments but that isn't really where this book went, which in my opinion is a shame. If you are looking for an easy to read dystopia that is well written and easy to get into then this book is great. It has some great action, some funny bits, a hint of romance here and there and a narrator that is easy to like. Dean isn't an action hero, he writes poetry and sucks at being social but he is adorable and I really loved his voice. Most of the other characters were also likeable but some of the things they did were a little unbelievable. Despite loving Dean I think this book might have been more interesting if we had heard from some more of the characters. I know it probably sounds like I hated this book but that is not true at all. I did enjoy it and thought Emmy Laybourne wrote some pretty amazing action scenes. I liked that this book was about a massive disaster not just the aftermath and I liked the disaster it is something that is plausible (I watch a lot of natural disaster documentaries.) Yes it could have been 'more' but as a quick and entertaining dystopia it was pretty good.",Kate Phillips
9781250027382,"Many thanks to the Publisher for my review copy, this is in exchange for an honest review. Wow! What an explosive book this is. Fast paced and exciting all the way through. The tension runs high and I just had to finish this book ASAP, just to see where it would end up. One of my top books of the year and it deserves a five star rating. I don't give five stars very often but this one merits it. The characters are great and are such a mixed bunch. You have to take a step back sometimes and realise really they are children, children who a thrown into such a horrible situation some adults would have struggled to cope with. Natural leaderships take place and you get the usual power struggle but I loved it. True character have flaws, well true to life ones do. And some of these flaws really show up in these bad bad circumstances. Throw in the chemical reactions some of the blood types have and it really hikes up the drama. I have to confess at the beginning of the book I did think one character was a girl, yeah I got fooled, but as the story unfolds I did have a lightbulb moment when I realised it was a boy. If you want a light easy book step away from Monument 14, this is not light, this is not easy. It is chaotic fast paced and will leave you a bit emotionally exhausted. Believe me you will enjoy the rollercoaster of a ride. I highly recommend this book and think that it does deserve all the praise I have lavished on it. It's awesome and please check it out! Overview: Amazing book. Top rated and will be one of my top books of the year.",Jennifer Juckes
9780062003256,"Take the beautiful, imaginary world of Neverland and make it a literal place where everything is messy and covered in dirt and that is the uninteresting world where Tiger Lily is set. I didn't think it was possible to make Neverland so completely boring. A few magical elements remain like fairies and mermaids but they felt very flat and unoriginal. There's also a poorly explained excuse for why some people get old and some people don't. If you're curious the reason some people don't get old is because it just happens when something important happens in your life for no logical reason whatsoever. The plot felt very been there done that in the way that Avatar was. It's kind of a tired plot line to have new people come and mess everything up for the indigenous people. I also felt like there was nothing new or interesting added to this retelling of Peter Pan. I personally like my retellings to have new twists otherwise what is the point of the retelling? I'm not really sure what the overall conflict even was. It felt like the plot just kind of dragged along with an ending that kind of baffled me. Honestly, the whole book felt a little preachy. There were a few cute scenes between Peter Pan and Tiger Lily but not enough to make me really love this book. The writing was good though it wasn't my favorite. The word choice stood out to me sometimes and felt a little awkward here and there like it was trying too hard to be poetic or something, but there were a few quotes I really liked. Like this one: ""I'm not myself,"" [Tiger Lily] offered, guilty. . . . ""You can never say that. You're just a piece of yourself right now that you don't like."" -Jodi Lynn Anderson, Tiger Lily (p. 69) My favorite character by far was Smee who sadly shows up in the book only a few times. The rest of the characters I had a hard time connecting with, especially Tiger Lily and the very strange decision she makes at the end of the book. I honestly found it hard to tell some of the characters apart. Overall, I did not enjoy the world building in this book at all. It had a tired plot line with a cast of characters that I ended up not caring much about.",Jessica B
9780062003256,"5788165 Cherie Searles's review Nov 26, 12 ?????ff'?????f'?????'???????????????* edit 5 of 5 stars false bookshelves: retellings, 5-star, favorites-of-2012 Read on October 22, 2012 Oh, how to review this book! It was unexpected and poetic and heartbreaking and emotional and piercing and exquisite. This is the story of Tiger Lily as seen through Tinker Bell's eyes. Set before the events of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan, it is a story of first love, of being true to yourself, of the reality of the world - good and bad. Those looking for the typical teen romance with lots of quivering and flip-flopping stomachs and make out scenes should look elsewhere. There is an innocence to the love story here that is sweet and sad. Ms. Anderson has a way with words. They are lyrical and poetic. They are descriptive in the most beautiful way. For example, ""How can I describe Peter's face, the pieces of him that stick to my heart? Peter sometimes looked aloof and distant; sometimes his face was open and soft as a bruise. Sometimes he looked completely at Tiger Lily, as if she were the point on which all the universe revolved, as if she were the biggest mystery of life, or as if she were a flame and he couldn't not look even though he was scared. And sometimes it would all disappear into carelessness, confidence, amusement, as if he didn't need anyone or anything on this earth to feel happy and alive."" and ""I recognized Tiger Lily instantly; I had seen her before. She stood out like a combination of a roving panther and a girl. She stalked instead of walked. Her body still held the invincibility of a child, when at her age it should have been giving way to fragile, flexible curves."" and ""To love someone was not what she had expected. It was like falling from somewhere high up and breaking in half, and only one person having the secret to the puzzle of putting her back together."" In my opinion, this is the mark of a truly great writer. Not only is the story compelling, but the words she chooses and they way she puts them together make you feel what the characters are feeling. You don't just sympathize with them, you empathize. The words are not chosen only to literally tell the story, or to make the author sound smart, they are chosen with care to captivate the reader and completely immerse them in the scene and characters. Peter and Tiger Lily have to be two of the loneliest characters. Their love for each other is so sweet but at the same time their doubt and inexperience is excruciating to read. I loved them both. The true star of this book, though, is Tinker Bell. As the narrator here we really see the truth of the story. We see loneliness and heartache and budding romance and injustice. She tells us at the beginning that good doesn't always win and that becomes evident as the story progresses. Not all endings are happy ones. I don't know what else to say except that I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone. I will be adding a hardcover copy of this one to my permanent favorites shelf in my home. flag",Cherie
9780062003256,"There are very few books that are able to embed themselves deeply into my heart... and I can honestly say that Tiger Lily's story is one of those. There are no right words for me to explain to you the emotions I felt while reading this book. This story is raw and beautiful. Tiger Lily is such a strong, loyal, spirited and capable girl, in more ways than one - she can do anything from hunting, climbing and running to being able to hide her emotions and was undaunted by the villagers ridicule and criticism. She cared deeply for her adoptive father, Tik Tok. And though she continually reminded herself that she only puts up with her two so-called friends, Pine Sap and Moon Eye, she cared very much for them too. When Tiger Lily meets Peter Pan, their worlds collide and tilt over. Peter Pan was thought to be a myth since none of the villagers had ever seen him. He was so much more than Tiger Lily ever imagined... The only boy out of the group that had no memories of his childhood. And his only way of protecting 'the boys' and himself was by living in denial and surviving one day at a time. Peter was mesmerizing and enthralling while at the same time impulsive, scattered and broken... and he became Tiger Lily's secret. And yes, Tiger Lily and Peter Pan's story is told through the eyes of Tinker Bell, sort of. As a fairy, Tink is able to feel what those around her are feeling and at times, she can even feel what they are thinking. And even though she is just a tiny speck of fairy dust who is ignored throughout the majority of their journey and is incapable of communicating with anyone other than other fairies - she does play a major role to their story. It was perfect. We also meet Captain Hook and Smee. Hook is what I would have expected. But Smee, I was taken by surprised with him. Let's just say that he is the one that people will write horrors about! And let's not forget Wendy. At first, I wanted to be angry with Wendy. If it wasn't for her, perhaps there would have been a different ending to this story. With her ""Englander"" and motherly ways, of course she was different from Tiger Lily. But she gave all of the boys hope to being loved and cared for, like the ways that they remembered. The same for Peter, a dream he always dared not to have. I understand now why the story ends the way that it does. We've all read Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie, and we all know how that ends. No spoilers were told here. Tiger Lily's story is bittersweet... heartbreaking. Jodi Lynn Anderson captured Tiger Lily beautifully. There will never be another more magical story between Peter Pan and Tiger Lily than this one.",Margarita Cortina
9780062003256,"Tiger Lily promised a dark and tragic interpretation of a familiar children's story, one that would steal your breath away - and that was right. This book is exactly what it promised to be- a new, fresh take on an old story, a love story. As fascinating a story as it is, I can also see how this introspective book wouldn't be for every reader- but it's sure to capture the hearts of many who enjoy a grand romance, and anything to do with Peter Pan. Reasons to Read: 1.A thoughtful interpretation of Peter Pan: I enjoy the story of Peter Pan, but I thought it was fantastic how well Jodi Lynn put her own spin on this story; the majority of the ""facts"" and details remain the same (or if they are changed, there's a reasonable explanation for it) and I was constantly surprised at how she made such a classic story her own. It can be hard to rework familiar territory, but the effect ends up making Tiger Lily a masterpiece of retellings. 2.Lovely storytelling: While at first I had some reservations with the story being narrated by Tinker Bell, I soon realized how effective it was being told from a third party. Part of what makes the story so poignant is that it's never really clear how the various characters truly feel about one another or their circumstances - and because it's told through Tinker Bell's eyes, it feels even more tragic because we get to see hints of the pain experienced by a number of characters rather than just Tiger Lily. Tinker Bell is remarkably unbiased (except when it comes to Tiger Lily, whom she clearly has strong ties to) and offers a different perspective on the events as well. 3.A strong, unique Tiger Lily: This is not the helpless, fairly bland Native American princess we're used to (thanks, Disney). Tiger Lily is reimagined as we haven't seen her before, and she's fully brought to life with her own past and her own personality. And her relationship with Peter Pan is beautiful in its own right, so simple and just plain RIGHT. It's the way things change between them that's so heartbreaking, and how they both feel lost to do anything about it. The one thing I was not expecting from this story was for the relationship between Tiger Lily and Peter Pan to be so pivotal, and even after reading most of it I didn't feel that should have had so much impact as it did. And the ending felt so rushed that it didn't feel wholly pulled together. I just had a hard time believing that this strong heroine would just sit back passively and watch while things happened around her, and then to react later on in such a strong, violent way. And honestly it was at that point that I began to lose my connection to Tiger Lily, because while I could understand her distress I couldn't fathom her rationale behind her choices. And for a book that's promoted as a love story- well, I found the romance between Peter and Tiger Lily to be rather rushed. And I found where the book really shone, was in its portrayal of various other relationships and qthe idea of cultures clashing and transformation and feeling like a misfit. THAT, more than any love story, is what the book (even unconsciously) seems to be about. And that's what's so striking about it. But all in all, this is a truly unique and stunning book that leaves a small mark on your heart. It's one that's unforgettable, partially because of how it makes you think differently about this familiar story and question characters like Pan, Wendy, Tiger Lily, and Tinker Bell to think of them in ways we've never seen before.

I loved this book and I give it a 5/5 stars! As Ia??ve said in my other reviews about this series, is that the characters are what makes it amazing! In this book, we focus on Nick Merrick and he struggles with keeping a huge secret and balancing all the other elements in his life such as school, college etc. I really felt my Nick and my heart went out to him because he felt he couldna??t be who he really was or he wouldna??t be accepted. Nick has always been the sweetest, kindest brother in my mind and I hated seeing him turn angry and bitter because life was weighing him down! Then therea??s Quinn, who I liked overall but sometimes I think she was so melodramatic but I liked how strong and opinionated she was and I felt sorry for her because of her family/home life! There were a couple of other secondary character, Tyler, who although has a lot of flaws, I actually adored him! And therea??s Adam who I also really liked although he wasna??t developed enough for me to really love him! As for the other characters, I loved seeing all the Merrick family, they are my favourite fictional family (aside from the Weasleys of course) As for the plot, a lot of it revealed around Nicka??s secret but there were other storyline such as Quinna??s family situation, the new guide, and by the end war was on the horizon! Just like the other books in the series, there was a lot of action scenes that created excitement and made this book a fast read! Also I loved learning about Nicka??s air element, and Ia??ve decided if I could control an element, it would be air!

Nick knows that he likes boys, and more specifically he likes Adam, but his emotions are not in check and he seems to be sending Quinn running into the arms of someone he really doesnt like or trust.

The storyline in this mainly revolved around Nick and Adam, with some time also devoted to Quinn and Tyler.

9780062020659,"So I'm just going to come out and say it. I loved this book. I loved everything about it: the characters, the plot, the dangerous world...everything. Let me start with the world-building. I would consider DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN to be a post-apocalyptic/dystopian crossover, heavier on the post-apocalyptic.Many of the post-apocalyptic books that I've read have been vague in that respect. In DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN, you learn exactly what happened to bring about the bleak existence humans endure. I don't want to give all the details away, because that aspect was fascinating for me to read. Long story short, there was a decades long war between humans and vampires. Vampires won. The VampHu treaty came out of this, the main stipulation being that vampires will not attack the humans within their walls as long as they provide blood to the vamps. So here we are in Denver, and our heroine Dawn is the new delegate to the leader of the local vampires, Lord ""Bloody"" Valentine. And though the treaty is intact, the humans go into hiding each day when the sun goes down, for fear of rogue vampires. Their safety in tenuous at best. Dawn, who has replaced her murdered parents as the delegate, is all but responsible for walking the fine line that keeps humans safe. I truly admired Dawn as a character. She is a teenager with the world on her shoulders, yet she manages to smile, have fun, live, and still take her duties seriously. She has her guardian, best friend Tegan (not the sharpest knife), and her long-time boyfriend, Michael. I did like Michael. He's protective, intense, and seemed to be devoted to Dawn. Until...he isn't. Michael has an ego that constantly needs reassured. He definitely has a hero complex and begins to grate at the nerves which made it remarkably easy for another guy to swoop in. That alluring new man is Victor. Victor is dashing, intriguing, and dangerous, but not in a bad boy way. He is exceedingly kind, goes out of his way, puts himself in danger to keep Dawn safe. He wants to do what's best for Dawn, even at his own risk. The dude made me hardcore swoon. The storyline was consistently moving ahead. I never felt as if it stalled. Not only is the consistent threat of Lord Valentine a factor, Dawn is also confronting danger on at least three different fronts, never mind the potential drama in her love life. There is an issue at the opening, that Valentine mentions later in the story, that's never explained. I'll assume it will be expanded on in the next book. I'm fine with that. When everything comes to a head, though, I thought the suspense would kill me, or at least make me pass out from holding my breath. The ending was a definite cliffhanger. I would have been screaming, dying to know what was happening. But, my book, a finished copy, has a sneak peek of book two, BLOOD-KISSED SKY. Well played, authors, because I am dying to read that book. Personal Note: In the synopsis, it is mentioned that fans of True Blood, the House of Night series, and Morganville Vampires series would enjoy this. I haven't read Morganville Vampires. But I have read the Sookie Stackhouse series and House of Night series. DBD, besides being a book with vampires that have come out, is nothing at all like Sookie Stackhouse series. And besides the obvious, vampires, it is nothing like the House of Night series. DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN is soooo much better. Sorry if I've stepped on any toes, but if someone told me this was like HoN, I probably wouldn't read it. Favorite Quote: ""In my dreams, we're the same. We can touch, kiss, love. And every dream ends with us ...being together forever."" (pg 224)",Andrea Thompson

Bad things first: Shay once again IRRITATED me to death. Seriously. That boy needs to crawl up and die somewhere. Alone. I do NOT like how he pushes Calla to do things when she can't even think straight (poor girl got a lot of stuff happening). He's also so annoying and selfish. Enough said. I don't know what to think of Calla. There are times when I admired her for being strong and confident, but there are several times when I felt like she was weak, and SELFISH. That is one thing that Shay and Calla have in common. I find her quite selfish, and didn't realize how much her stupid decisions (about saving Shay at the end of 'Nightshade') affected her family and pack mates back home. She's lucky she's got SOME great friends, 'cause if I were her I would not forgive her that easily after what the Keepers had done to the rest of her pack mates. And for what? For Shay?? Please he is not even worth it. ALSO: Where is Ren in this book? *SPOILER* He's only appeared in one tiny scene, which didn't even last long. Is this the way that Andrea's telling us that Calla will end up with Shay????? I HOPE HOPE HOPE Ren would play a MUCH BIGGER part in Bloodrose. Or I will die. And. You'll know who to blame. Now after I got that out of my chest, moving on to the best: What shines in both 'Nightshade' and 'Wolfsbane' is the plot. It is so amazing and complex and interesting. I really enjoyed learning more about the history of both the Keepers and the Searchers. How Andrea weaved them all together is just so magically done and wow, there are times when I my jaw literally dropped after all the revelations. Trust me, you wouldn't see anything coming. (Or at least, I didn't hehehe) While I didn't love the main characters (except for Ren! TEAM REN FOREVER!!! ) I did found myself loving the secondary characters much more. Monroe, Connor, Ethan, Adne and Silas all added something new to the story and I love learning the history and personalities of each one :D And I am in love with Connor. ;P *SPOILER* The pack members reappeared in Wolfsbane aswell, and I am not shocked to see which ones sided with the enemy (those that have read it would know what I mean). Overall, I LOVE Wolfsbane. And I screamed when the biggest cliffhanger of death appeared in front of me. Seriously I am already getting impatient waiting for Bloodrose.

The country Will loved, the country he felt close to God. His travel journal and her musical practices for an interview at the Manhattan music conservatory should help her to feel inspired and whole again. But they don't. Finley doesn't know it yet, but it will be the popular Hollywood movie star Beckett Rush, she coincidentally meets on the plane to Ireland, who will be the greatest help on her way to finding her own voice in life and a bond to God. Finley becomes Beckett's assistant in exchange for a guided tour through the sights of the green island. Philosophical and religious reflections are a great part of Finley's life. Usually stories strongly influenced by musical and religious aspects aren't my thing, but Finley's story was very exquisite and unostentatious. Ireland serves as the vibrant and rurally beautiful background to Finley and Beckett's love story. The various sights of the green isle awaiting to be explored by the two hold many wonders and magic. In particular they seem to know how to bring two teens together who haven't been truly happy in a long time and give them the power to change their lives out of their own strength and the innocent and loving feelings for each other. 4/5 **** THERE YOU'LL FIND ME - An inspirited story about the incomprehensible ways of life, a tender love story and finding to God again. THERE YOU'LL FIND ME first didn't appear to be one of the stories that usually appeal to me.

Through a list of funny ways Beckett becomes Finley's tour guide through Ireland, where not only a friendship blossoms but maybe something more. I loved this book. It was filled with a great mixed group of characters some nice and some less than so. Every character in the book good or bad had a role to play, one that made the book so much better. I knew going into this book it was going to be so much more than some young adult romance, I knew it was going to be deep and heartfelt, and I was right. I finished it in one seating, only a two hours. Jenny B. Jones take a storyline and makes it so much more. As I've said before I don't read Christian book but this author is amazing and this book can make anyone relate to it. It was funny, sad, deep, happy, and just plain ole good. What I love the most that the fact that you didn't have to read Save the Date in order to understand what was going on, it stood out on its own. I'd recommend this book to any and everyone. Also if you haven't read Save the Date by Jenny B.

There You'll Find Me is a touching journey of finding something you once have that you've lost: yourself, love, your faith in people and in Him, in a place where you least expect it to be.

9781595545404,"I don't read a lot of contemporary fiction. I'm more of an escapist reader who prefers fantasy, paranormal romance and science fiction but my friend KM from One Page at a Time raved about this book and recommended that I read it, and since she has never given me a bad recommendation, I thought I would give it a try. I loved There You'll Find Me so much. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me think about all the things in my own life that I try to control when I should really just let go and let God handle it. While I did not know it at the time, There You'll Find Me was exactly the kind of book I needed to read. Finley, heiress to a hotel chain and recovering party girl, cannot get over the death of her beloved older brother, Will. She is angry at God for not saving Will, a devout Christian and humanitarian who was working to rebuild schools in Afghanistan when he was killed by a bomb. Seeking closure and peace, Finley follows in her brother's footsteps by going to Ireland for her senior year of high school, just as he did. Finley is smart and snarky. She is also loving, kind and oh so flawed. I found her to be such a realistic and likable character. She considers Ireland a fresh start but for a girl who has felt that her life is out of control, Finley strives to control what she can (her diet, weight and her relationships with others) with disastrous results. There is an awesome romance in this book that is so sweet! Beckett is a teen heartthrob movie star (along the lines of Robert Pattinson) and the dialogue between he and Finley is hilarious. While I loved seeing the relationship between Finley and Beckett develop, it is not main focus of the book. There You'll Find Me is really about Finley's healing and finding her way back to a loving God who never left her in the first place. The main characters and the secondary characters in this book are very well developed and I must point out that Ireland itself is like a secondary character. The descriptions of the country are breathtaking and makes me want to get there and see it for myself! I also love Jones' subtle but effective writing, mainly the steady way we see Finley's issues spiraling out of control. The pacing in the book is perfect, it's never rushed and not too slow either. There You'll Find Me is not your mom's Christian fiction. It's fresh, funny, entertaining and extremely appealing to anyone who wants to read really good contemporary YA fiction. I want to thank Ms. Jones for showing me that a book about heavy issues can be sensitively written with humor and light. I'm really, really hoping that she plans on writing more books like this.

9780385736855,"(I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to books4reviews.) This is the second book in the 'Forest of Hands and Teeth' series. Gabrielle (or Gabry) is a teenager. She's lived her entire life in a lighthouse, surrounded on 3 sides by water and on 1 side by the forest. Her mother is very different to the other people that live in the village, she claims to have been born and raised in a village in the forest of hands and teeth, a story that the people of the village reject as delusional. The reader knows this to be true though as Gabrielle's mother is Mary - the main character from book 1 - 'The Forest of Hands and Teeth'. Gabrielle's world is a little different to Mary's in book 1, Gabrielle and her friends have only ever really heard about the Mudo (or unconsecrated) at school, and haven't had the real-life experiences that Mary had. Gabrielle has always been taught to fear what lies beyond the fence though, and the thought of her friends going over the wall to visit the old roller coaster makes her feel sick. Her best friend Cira, and Cira's brother Catcher are both going though, and when it seems like Catcher might return her secret feelings for him, Gabrielle allows herself to go along with their plan, and follows them over the way and to the amusement park. Gabrielle's world is soon turned upside down though when a 'breaker' (a newly turned unconsecrated that is 'fast' and can run), bites one of her friends, and then goes after the rest of the group. Gabrielle is saved by Catcher, but he is bitten during the scuffle, and Gabrielle sees her life crumbling before her very eyes. Gabrielle runs, but the others are caught by the 'Militia' (the men who guard the fence). Those that are bitten are killed, and those that aren't are imprisoned to await their punishment. Catcher is missing though, and when Cira begs Gabrielle to go back into the forest and look for him, Gabrielle knows that her life will never be the same again. I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't sure where the author was going to go after 'The Forest of Hands and Teeth' and I was surprised to find that so much time had passed between book 1 and book 2, and that we now had a different lead character. Gabry is not a brave girl; in fact she's scared of entering the forest, and wants to stay safe within the fences of the village where she knows it is safe. Like many teenagers though she is swayed by the boy she has feelings for, and follows her friends into the forest. She soon realises what a mistake this is, and wishes that she could go back in time and change things. We don't hear much from Mary initially, although we do get some revelations from her later on in the story. I wondered initially who Gabrielle's father was, but it turned out to be a much more complicated situation that I could have imagined, and I wondered exactly how much time had passed between the end of the first book and the start of the second. Similarly to the first book we have a sort-of love triangle situation going on. In the first book this was quite a complicated affair between Mary, her best friend Cass, and the brother's Travis and Harry, and in this book it's between Gabrielle, Catcher, and a boy called Elias who comes to Gabrielle's rescue when she goes back outside the village looking for Catcher. Once again though things are never simple, and when not running for her life, Gabrielle agonises over her feelings for the two boys. I felt really sorry for Gabrielle throughout this book, she just has so much thrown at her, and everything she has ever wanted or loved seems to be taken away from her, even if this was in part due to poor decisions on her part. First she has to deal with friends being infected, dying, or being locked away to await punishment. Then she learns things about herself and her family that she never knew before which leaves her unsure of who she even is anymore, and then there's even worse to come! Poor Gabry really does go through an awful lot in this story, and you can't help but feel for her. I did feel that the story slowed down quite a bit in the middle, and even dragged a bit at points, which is why this wasn't a 5 star book for me. Things did pick up again towards the end though, for a gripping finish, although we were left with a bit of a cliff hanger. I have to say that I'm intruiged to find out what will happen in book 3, although I hate to think how things could possibly get worse for Gabry and co. in this hell-ish zombie-filled wastleland. 8.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9781416989431,"It had been a while since I had read Hush, Hush but it took me no time at all to get right back into the storyline and pick up where I left off. This series is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Hush, Hush was one of the best books I read in 2011 and Crescendo was definitely not a letdown. There were a lot of things in this book that surprised me. I tried to work out the plot as I read (like always) and found that my thoughts were a lot more complicated than the actual storyline. This worked in the authors favor this time because it left me shocked by some revelations in the end. There were quite a few things that I didn't see coming and a lot of things that had me frustrated with the characters, but in a good way. I finished the book pretty quickly and immediately began reading Silence, the next in the series. This is definitely a series of books that continue to hold my interest and keep me guessing. Which a really good thing.",Rainy Days and Pajamas
9781416989431,"Disclaimer: I felt it was virtually impossible to properly review Crescendo without revealing spoilers from both it and Hush, Hush. So while I usually don't do this, this review DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS - please do not read if you haven't read either Hush, Hush or Crescendo, and you don't want insider knowledge. I am left feeling like Hush, Hush was originally written as a stand-alone, and that Crescendo is a botched attempt at turning it into a feasible series. ""Why do you think that Kelly?"", you might be asking. Let me count the reasons why! 1. By the ending of Hush, Hush, Nora and Patch are both ecstatic that Patch has been assigned as Nora's guardian angel, because they can continue to be together. Within the first few chapters of Crescendo, however, Patch explains that he will be banished to hell for loving Nora - and that the archangels are watching closely for any excuse to revoke him of his new-found angel status. Nora responds to this in the only way she knows how, by jumping to the most ridiculous conclusion - Patch is cheating on her with her arch nemesis, Marcie. So she calls off their relationship under the pre tense that because Patch cannot physically share in the pleasure of her touch, he must not love her (great message there). Luckily for us (please not my sarcasm), we get to repeatedly bear witness to Nora's angst and confusion over the reason(s) for their breakup, and her lack of courage leaves her unable to do the right thing, and walk away. 2. Clues are leaked throughout Crescendo, and eventually we find out a (not-so) shocking truth (for those who were paying attention) about Nora's past: Harrison Grey is not her biological father! In fact, her biological father is her arch-nemesis Marcie's father, Hank Millar! Dun dun dun! But wait, didn't the entire premise of Hush, Hush revolve around Harrison being a descendant of Nephilim and that's what makes Nora an acceptable sacrifice in Patch's quest for a human body? Looks like we have a gaping plot hole to fix! The solution? Are you sitting down, because it's going to make your head spin! Harrison and Hank are distantly related to the same Nephilim blood line! Phew, that explains everything then! But wait, does it? Because in Crescendo we learn that Hank gave Nora to Harrison to protect, as he feared his Nephilim heritage may come back to harm her later. But if both men are descendants of Nephilim, granted Hank is a much closer descendant then Harrison, would that not put Nora in danger either way? And if Hank was that concerned about his offspring, why did he keep Marcie? So terribly confusing, that I'm sure that was the point. Maybe if we're confused enough, we won't question the inconsistencies. 3. Considering it's maybe a month or two since we left Patch and Nora in Hush, Hush I got to wondering how the rise of the Nephilim under ""the Black Hand"" is only now becoming news. Wouldn't that have explained Patch's desperation to get his own human body in Hush, Hush? 4. Why couldn't Patch just tell Nora she was in danger? He ended up going rogue for her in the end anyways, why risk her life? Or why didn't he just tell her the truth in her dreams, where the archangels couldn't hear their conversations? Why did he try to feed her clues instead of just being straightforward? Considering absolutely nothing happens until the last few chapters, we could all have been spared the 350 pages of angsty filler fluff if Patch hadn't been so elusive about everything that was happening. Oh I know why, because this was never meant to be a series, and Fitzpatrick had to come up with something to cause conflict. I was hoping that at least the ending would have some redeemable qualities, but alas, it wasn't the case. The final showdown between Nora and the person looking to harm her is one big bad guy tell-all info-dump (such a cop out) and after passing out from being shot in the arm (I wish this girl would grow a pair) she awakes to forgive Patch for all of his transgressions and they live happily ever after! Joke!! How could there be two more books in this series if that was the case?! Of course we're left with a cliffhanger ending, but at this point I couldn't care less.",Pretty Little Reader
9781416989431,"SPOILERS ALERT!! Scroll to the bottom to avoid! Prologue- Noras dad had made an agreement of some sort with someone and after many years is told by that person to take Nora far away because a guy will be after her when she turns 16 but her father was killed before he could act on the news. Just when she thought everything will be back to normal, her life turns into a tempest. Patchs sudden closeness with Marcie and her mixed feeling about a future with Patch pushes her to break it off with him, quickly regretting her actions. ""When I kiss my boyfriend, I want to know he feels it!"" Her childhood friend Scott shifts back into town and her first meeting with him ignites her suspicions. She has a vivid dream from a way back of Underwood being lured by a fallen angel then realized that he was Marcies father from a time way back. Nora thinks she saw her dad alive. She keeps spending time with Scott just to spite Patch despite him warning that he is a dangerous Nephilim. It seems that Scoot is a first generation Nephilim belonging to the Blood Society intent on freeing themselves from the bondage of the fallen that will inadvertently affect the human race. She pushes him further away to keep him safe from the Archangels and at the same time hurting with sight of him with Marcie. The mystery of her fathers' death opens a new road when someone anonymous sends her ring and note saying ""The Ring Belongs to the Black Hand He Killed Your Father"". The day after another encounter of her dad leads her straight into an illusion in which he dad supposedly tries to kill her and an eventful visit from Patch in her dream she gets drugged off a note from Patch and trapped, fleeing the last moment finding out later that it was another illusion. Nora gets a hold of Marcies diary in an attempt to clear her suspicions on her relationship with Patch and is taken by surprise at Patchs offer to live a short life in hiding until he is dealt with the ultimate punishment. She refuses his offer to keep him safe but decides to torture herself watching him from afar which does her emotions no good. She discovers a fraction of Scotts past that involves the Black Hand when she stumbles across a clue as she tries to use Scott to return to Patch she same pain she felt everytime she sees him with Marcie. ""He's not worth it. And neither am I"" When Nora talks to Rixon about Patch, he implies that its obvious that Marcie is more compatible with Patch than she is and that he's entitled to some fun. She is stunned to also find out that Patch was called the Black Hand before. Overwhelmed by all her emotions, act recklessly to get back at him for his special treatment to Marcie and if he'd killed her dad. She had fallen in love with the devil and she was going to make him pay for it. The look on Patchs face later when confronted about her dad crushed her completely.... She decides to search Patchs house after fishing the location from Rixon but her plan comes to a halt when she discovers a painful secret from Marcie; her mom had been sleeping with Marcies dad. As Nora prepares to leave her home, Patch appears in her dream, deciding to tell her the truth. He had been assigned as Marcies Guardian Angel to prevent the fallen angel bound to Marcies father kill Marcie and Chaunceys successor wants his death avenged. Nora found herself struggling to come to terms of Patch as the Black Hand who killed her dad. To get back the ring Nora stole from him, Scoots finally reveals the whole truth to his branding mark but end up getting arrested from struggles gone too far to get back his ring. Scotts says the Black Hand is a Nephilim and Rixon says Patch was called one before Scotts comes for his ring again and everything turns chaotic. When Rixon tries to save her, she discovers a train of earth shattering secrets along with a realization. ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ This one is much better than the first! Excellent plotline; well written with lots of mystery just like I love it. Although Nora can be a little childish and immature at times, I could connect with her better this time around. I'm glad Vee proved to be more of a best friend in contrast to the first book. I really do appreciate the subtle progress of Patchs character; it's very believable. I am a little upset there was little scenes with Patch and Nora together but the suspense made up for it. And with the little tease in the end, I can't wait for the next sequel.",Shayla
9781416989431,"What I loved about Hush, Hush was that the romance wasn't the main focus of the book. Yes, the romance is a major aspect of the story but there is also the mystery of who is after Nora. The mystery, the suspense, the constant mind games Nora was being thrown was what made me enjoy the book. I found the characters to be entertaining and fun to read and Nora didn't annoy me as many female characters seem to do in paranormal YA. When I finished Hush, Hush I couldn't wait to read Crescendo. Its unfortunate that I did not enjoy Crescendo nearly as much as I did its predecessor. There was still mystery, and danger, and Vee who had made herself onto the bad best friend's list in the later half of Hush, Hush redeemed herself in Crescendo (an unexplained 180 but I'll take it). Vee was funny, dependable and someone I wouldn't mind spending time with which made it all the more easier for me to not like Nora. I found Nora to be needy, ""too stupid to live"" and just basically irritating and because Nora was the narrator for the story she really ruined the book for me. Patch was basically a complete mystery for most of this book he has secrets that he can't share with Nora which makes her suspect the worse and accuse him of the worse which I could not understand because Patch, despite having his secrets, was always there for Nora, constantly pulling her out of the trouble she deliberately puts herself in. There were parts of this book that were really hard to read because I just wanted to yell at Nora for her actions and thoughts and if it wasn't for her being so irritating I would have really enjoyed this book. We learn a lot more about angel and nephillim dynamics, there is more character development when it comes to side characters like Rixon and Marcie Millar and as I got more answers there were a lot more questions for me to ask. The ending, there were parts I saw coming and others I didn't, I enjoyed the action and the twist and its because of the ending that I will be reading the next book in the series.",Sandy
9781416989431,"I absolutely love the Hush Hush series by Becca Fitzpatrick. Hush Hush is the start of the very adventures of Nora Grey and Patch Cipriano. This series is set around a small town called Coldwater where Patch walked into Nora's life at Coldwater High by becoming her bio partner when Coach McConaughy decide to make a seating plan so Patch could get closer to Nora. But Nora knew there wasn't something right about Patch until he told her that he was a fallen angel. Crescendo picks up again with Patch, Nora and Vee (Nora's best friend) but things start to become complicated when Marcie Millar starts hanging out with Patch. Nora is still trying to find out who her father's killer is. Yet again Becca Fitzpatrick has really gone all out and made this book an awesome book to read, you just can't simply put it down! If you still haven't picked up this series then you have not read a great book series!",Claudia
9781416989431,"I absolutely adored this book, although I may be a little biased given how in love with Patch I was through 'Hush, Hush' The book turns into a page turner that you just can't put down, however the beginning did frustrate me a little I felt it linked back too closely to the structure of New Moon. I love the Nancy Drew feel of the hunt for her Dad's killer but find the 'Angel Mind thing' a little bit frustrating and confusing. (You'll understand what I mean when you read the book). All in all, a fabulous book, I'd recommend it to people who love the Twilight saga as something different and a step away from the Vampire genre. I personally would recommend Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater!! :) Hazel",Hazel Loves Design

9781743316429,"If Sherlock Holmes can have a Watson, then stands to reason that James Mycroft can have a Watts. Right? Rachel Watts and James Mycroft - neighbours, friends and now amateur sleuths. When the pair stumble upon a crime scene, Mycroft's inquisitional nature and passion for forensics urge him to investigate further - and drag Watts along with him. In a quest to find justice for their friend Homeless Dave, Watts finds herself falling deeper into the deadly mystery and makes her question her relationship with the secretive boy who lives next door... As a Sherlock Holmes fan I was excited to read this book. From Arthur Conan Doyle to the BBC show, Sherlock, I love the stories about the famous fictional detective. And whilst I was expecting this to be a modern take on the classic story, I was thrilled by Ellie Marney's debut novel. This is no retelling but rather it's an exciting new story about Mycroft and Watts - two teens who both don't quite fit in. Watts is a recent transplant from the bush and hates every moment she spends in the city. Mycroft is a little eccentric and has problems with mainstream society. But somehow they fit each other perfectly. I loved the references to Sherlock Homes sprinkled throughout the book - like Diogenes and Baker Street. I liked Watts and Mycroft as characters. They are so different and yet rather similar. They are both a little angry and hurt and are frustrated by their family situations and their ways of coping are vastly contrasting. And the chemistry between the two is great to read. Somehow they are friends and they both go ahead with the other's schemes and as a result they balance each other out perfectly. Mycroft is slightly insane. And his antics? Crazy. But overall he's a well-meaning and likeable lead. Secondary characters like Watts' family, Mai and Gus are interesting enough and help the story along as Watts and Mycroft get deeper and deeper into the mystery. I love a good whodunit murder mystery and Every Breath delivered an entertaining plot. There's a lot of action but also a lot of character, humour and even a dash of romance to keep things flowing. I also enjoyed how Melbourne was utilized as the setting. The streets, the trams and the Zoo were all fantastically incorporated to add to the whole Australian vibe of this novel. This was a great read and I loved Marney's take on the murder mystery. Every Breath kept me hooked until the last page. I couldn't wait to find out if my suspicions of who did it were correct! Zany characters, great plot and a fantastic setting in the city of Melbourne. I loved this book and there is no doubt - I will definitely be checking out the two sequels, Every Word and Every Move when they are released in 2014 and 2015.",Kate @ Fictional Thoughts
9780152051242,"In Ursula K. Le Guin's GIFTS, the gifts in question bring more trouble than happiness to the novel's main character, sixteen-year-old Orrec. Orrec lives in the Uplands, a rough landscape where small clans squabble amongst themselves to maintain their land holdings and cattle herds. The leader of each clan has a specific gift: a mystical power that allows them to call animals or twist human bodies with the force of their mind. Orrec is the next in line to lead his clan, and his family's gift is one of the most terrible: the undoing. His father can kill a man with a word and a gesture, and it is expected that Orrec will come into the same power. However, when Orrec's power arrives, it is wild and uncontrollable, and he must stay blind-folded to avoid harming those he loves. The best thing about this outstanding novel is its premise. Everyone has wished at one time or another for a secret power. GIFTS forces the question: what if your having such a gift caused harm to the people around you? It gives no easy answers, exploring the issue with depth and feeling. The society and culture of the Uplanders is detailed and realistic, making the conflicts that much more powerful. Readers will quickly feel as though they've lived in this wonderful and terrifying world themselves. As narrator, Orrec is thoughtful and questioning, with a rhythmic voice that recalls traditional story-tellers. He handles the tragedies and disappointments in his life with honesty and good humor. Despite being from a somewhat alien world, his view is very human and teens will find it easy to see through his eyes. When he is finally able to face the most disappointing truth of all, readers will cheer even as they share his pain. GIFTS is an excellent read for teens of all interests. Fans of fantasy will be particularly drawn to it, but the world is grounded enough in earthly reality that it should appeal even to those who usually avoid the fantastical. Thought-provoking and suspenseful, with a dollop of action and romance, a novel like this is a gift to its readers.",TeensReadToo

This is a more harder book than he's used to and I had him read it as a challenge while being there to readily help him along so he wouldn't get frustrated.

Cam and her friend Eric are interesting, bright and responsible fifth-graders whom I enjoyed reading about. Eric is trying to enter a photography contest at school but he comes across some ne'er-do-well who must cheat at everything and Cam and Eric set out to figure what he is up to and honesty wins out in the end. Ds seemed to be enjoying the story as he read, he had no complaints and laughed along with the story, but he's at that stage where if you ask him if he liked a book he'll just say ""no"" for the mere fact that he had to read it.

9780061797033,"Huh. Just had a weird moment as a book blogger. I have wanted to read The Gathering because I totally loved Darkest Powers series. But then I went to search for my reviews... and it was before I was blogging. It's hard to believe that moment of searching and remembering that this hasn't been an amazing part of my life for as long as I even thought. So. Here's a plug for an older series that is amazing. Derek was smoking hot and I loved the story line and I was pretty sad when it ended and I knew my time with the characters was coming to an end. So here I am three years late discovering the series and my love for her writing and characters that are easy to like. Maya has an affinity for the animals and she has a bordering on weird relationship with the bob cats in the area. And she really begins to wonder when she's called a witch by an old lady at a tattoo parlor when she went in to get work done on her birthmark, shaped like a cat's paw. I enjoyed the exploration into her abilities as well as the mystery with the rest of the town. The medical research, the focus on the teens, the death of Maya's best friend the summer before. I feel like it did take a bit to get set up in the paranormal aspect of the plot, but I didn't mind at all because I liked Maya as a character. The cast of secondary characters was great as well. Daniel, her best friend was great to read about. I loved the easy time they spent together and their natural sweet friendship. They were so open with each other and he is such a good guy, protective and strong that I was still half rooting for a relationship between the two. But as the synopsis suggests, the bad boy sexy new guy makes an appearance. Just like Maya since Rafe has done the catch and release with so many other girls, I was so weary of him and his advances on Maya. But the fact that he lets down his guard and his relationship with his sister I can't help but give him a chance. Plus the chemistry between him and Maya is pretty undeniable. I will definitely be continuing this series, but the ending to the first book didn't really give me a whole ton of closure. It felt like it stopped too soon with climax and not answering enough questions while still raising even more. But that aside, it was an enjoyable and quick read.

Meanwhile, Lag himself has found something else of interest in this neighbourhood and the mystery of Niche is finally unveiled and is a unique fantasy story, one which makes her an even more interesting character. A fast-paced read, this series is always very easy to jump into the next volume and get carried away with the story. Rated T for 13+ I've always found this series to be very mild compared to others with the same rating, however, this volume does have almost complete female front nudity. If you look at the girl on the cover, let's just say there is a whole lot more clothes on her there, than in the book! But as I said it is *almost* and her scenes are not s*xual in any manner.

This is a really good book for people who are interested in wildlife. Drake Mc Bride and Jimmy Lee Bailiss work in an oil drilling company who are drilling in section 22, an illegal area and are willing to do anything to keep it a secret. One part of the story that I didn't like was that Drake Mc Bride and Jimmy Lee Bailiss's conversations were a bit too long, which made me start flicking through the pages to where the conversations ended. The Author could have made these conversations a bit more interesting. So after all, I think that the story 'SCAT' can be enjoyed by all ages. It has mystery, adventure, and a little bit of crime, and is a book I will read again and again.",Oriana Follas
9781442419957,"Sensitive Reader: This is NOT a spoiler, as the description tells you this. This book is about an incestuous relationship between siblings, AND there are scenes that might be rather racy no matter who was in them - when I read them, I felt almost guilty. I remember reading V. C. Andrews' Flowers in the Attic series when I was MUCH younger, and although there will be inevitable comparisons between those books and this one, the only thing they really have in common is the target subject. The scene is London: Maya and Lochan are a brother and sister made parents to their younger brothers and sister well before their time by a mother so coldly irresponsible that THIS parent wanted to reach into the book and slap her dead in her face. Suzuma's writing is impeccable as she tells a story of the almost inevitable relationship that surfaces and the price that is paid. I must admit to being very disturbed by the relationship as I thought (well, tried to think, since thinking about it almost made me throw up in my mouth) of the possibility of me and my own brother ... ugh .. can't even write it out (Love ya, bro'! Just never THAT much). Even though you know it's wrong, you hope against hope that things will somehow work out, and I found my heart in my throat at some scenes. This is an intense, absorbing, at times horrifying (at least to this reader) reading experience. An excellent book, but definitely for the OLDER YA set and above. QUOTE (from a galley; may be different in final copy): We're not like that. We're not sick. We're just a brother and sister who also happen to be best friends. That's the way it's always been between us. I can't lose that or I will not survive. Book Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars",Julie Smith
9781442419957,"Because of the subject matter this is a book that I can't really recommend, you just have to decide for yourself if you want to read it. Lochan and Maya have a hard life and are just doing their best to keep their family together and social services away. Their mother, something she has no right to be called, is too busy with men and having a good time. She can't be bothered with things like putting food on the table, helping with homework or taking her two younger children to school. Lochan and Maya have always done everything parents should do for their children, which contributes to them not seeing each other as brother and sister. This book left my sense of what's right and wrong unhinged. I felt for the characters, which made me feel guilty for any hint of judgment and really messed with my mind. I thought if anyone knew them and what they have to deal with, they wouldn't be able to judge. It's emotionally draining and very well written. Tabitha Suzuma takes her time to set the stage for the story - which in a lot of books tends to be rushed over. The ending isn't really an ending, it's more of a to be continued or question mark without any possibility of a sequel. Not the type of ending I'm use to, but perfect for this story. Any other ending would of felt forced.",safaripoet
9781442419957,"Lochan and Maya are brother and sister. Their three younger siblings depend on them ever since their dad left them and their mother no longer cares for them. With the pressure of this enormous responsibility, Maya and Lochan turn to each other. They find solace and comfort, but they find so much more than that. They find love. Not just sibling love, but real emotional, physical love. How can they love each other when the rest of the world sees their actions as disgusting and vile? FORBIDDEN deals with an incredibly controversial subject, and readers should be warned. Lochan and Maya are brother and sister, but they love each other in the way that any normal couple would. The first half of the book doesn't even touch the subject; it sets the scene with depictions of a family falling apart and a set of siblings doing all they can to hold it together. The second half delves into their incestuous relationship and the torrent of emotions and consequences that come along with it. Though this type of relationship is looked down upon by society, I couldn't help but hope that Maya and Lochan would work out. Their love was deeper than any other I've encountered and it was truly real because of everything they had suffered through together. It was hard to accept the fact that they were related, but also easy at the same time. Their relationship, as you can imagine, pushed boundaries to their breaking points. The emotional side balanced with the physical side. The thoughts of each character were drawn out and talked about comprehensively. They were real people with honest emotions. This is one of those books that will rip apart your heart and make you question everything you've ever believed in. By the novel's end I was in tears. The story was shocking and difficult at times, but it was worth it. FORBIDDEN is a stunning read that shouldn't be missed. I highly recommend it. **Please note: FORBIDDEN includes a disclaimer that the story isn't suitable for younger readers. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780758266941,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/review-kiss-of-frost-by-jennifer-estep/ The cover of this book is so pretty! (Sorry, I love snow-which is highly uncommon down here in Louisiana.) I like it the most out of the four covers in the series released so far. (In my opinion, Crimson Frost looks the worst. Cringe.) Anyway. Though Kiss of Frost had much of the same cons that its prequel did, I did enjoy it more. Time to insert a list. The cons. (Might as well get the bad stuff out the way first.) 1. Once again, I was bothered by how predictable the story was. As soon as I met the guy (or girl!), I knew he (or she) was the Reaper. Call it bibliophile's instinct, but I knew, right off the bat. It's a cliche move, actually. And the predictability here was even worse than in the prequel. 2. There was a lot of repeating. Gwen continually explained the things we learned in the first book-like, the statues on the campus. It would certainly have been helpful if it had been a while since I'd read the first book, but I practically read Touch of Frost and Kiss of Frost back to back. So it was exhausting to read the same things over and over. I know that most authors aren't sure if they should recap, so it isn't a big deal, but my suggestion is that if they want to recap, they should do it in a prologue. That way, readers can choose to skip it if they'd like. 3. The character development, once again. Gwen's being stupid again for missing who the Reaper was, but she might have gotten slightly less stupid. Or made an attempt at being slightly less stupid. However, I still think Gwen's too absorbed in being poorer than her classmates. She's also quite whiny about her mom's death. And she's quite absorbed in Logan Quinn, but who can blame her for that? Logan's also pretty one-dimensional again, but thankfully we finally had a taste of what's been causing him so much grief. The pros: 1. Plot twist that I totally didn't expect. Obviously, I can't say much, but let's just say that things mentioned in the first book might not necessarily have been true. 2. The romance. Sure, it's cliched, but I can never stop myself from smiling at the cute and swoon-worthy moments. Logan's HOT, so it's not like I can help it. 3. Vic. THAT SWORD. Oh, he cracks me up. 4. A certain amazing Fenrir wolf. I don't have a pet, but I've been dying to get a puppy since the beginning of time. Sure, Fenrir wolves are probably twenty times as big as a little puppy, but I WANT ONE. In other words... Did I like Kiss of Frost? Yes, but the series still hasn't really impressed me yet. I need a big BAM-something that knocks me off my feet. However, I did like Kiss of Frost more than its prequel, so I hope the pattern continues with the next book, Dark Frost.

Gwen is training hard now that she has become the champion for the Goddess Nike in the war against the Reapers. Killing does not come easy for Gwen. Her gypsy powers, which are growing stronger, are triggered through touch. Now her power smight just help her in the fighting department. Gwen is still best friends with Daphne and that bond has grown stronger in the last few months. Her crush on Logan is very apparent and his rejection has cause Gwen to hurt deeply. The Reapers have continued attacking and Gwen is number one on their hit list. Reapers are known to revenge their own. Students being students still want to have fun. And what can be more fun than partying at a secluded skiing resort with other Academy's from around the world. Daphne convinces Gwen to go even though there have been several attempts on her life which of course she does not rely this information to anyone because Gwen wants to fight it herself. This sets up for some hairy situations and will clearly test Gwen's strength and Logan's devotion. With the introduction of students from another Academy, Estep creates the perfect set up for us to wonder who is out to get Gwen. Is it someone close to her or someone she has just met? Another great book by Estep and one of my favorite moments is a very intense moment between Logan and Gwen (when you read or if you have read you should know what moment I mean). I did find that the person out to get Gwen wasn't a surprise to me but overall it was an astounding read. I was not able to put the book down once I started reading it.

9781421529523,"Reason for Reading: next in the series. Another great entry in this series. Briefly without giving anything away this volume continues to expand upon our main character, Lag,'s development. We learn a little more about Niche's mysterious being and Lag spends time with a couple of other Letter Bee's with whom we've only met in passing before. A couple of new characters are introduced, both of whom appear they will be major characters from now on, especially since the next volume is named after one of them. Most importantly to the plot we learn that there are people who are not happy about the way things are being run by the government. I didn't notice Lag's ""crybaby"" attitude showing once this time around. He has really started to mature. Niche is up to her old tricks with flying knicker-less again since we find out Sylvette gave her a pair of lacy girl's knickers and she does not like them. There is plenty of humour to be found in this volume. But there are also several fights with the Gaichuu (and others) for those looking for action and most importantly of all, to me, the plot and characters move forward in several directions continuing with the main plot of trying to find Gauche, whose trail they know they are upon, and continuing and introducing several side plots as well. Now just to wait for May and Volume 5. This is one of my favourite manga series.",Nicola Mansfield
9780062026095,"The talent runs in the family, that's for sure! I remember prior to reading this book, I had read and loved I Am Not A Serial Killer by Dan Wells, so finding out that these two wonderful writers are in fact brothers was surprising to the point that I never thought that I could enjoy both styles of writing so much. You know that type of book that you just can't stop reading or be surprised by it? Variant is exactly like that and much, much more. I can't precise what was that attracted me to this book, but all I could do once I had it in my hands was to read it and read it and read it a bit more. The plot is remarkably mysterious right in the first pages, so if you like Benson and are curious about why he wants to run away so fervidly, this sure is a book that is going to make you go crazy of anxiety from start to end. It was very intelligent of Wells to pick as his novel's background an immensely restrict and limited world, instead of going all the way of creating an ultimately new dystopian environment like many other authors of the genre do, so this way we was able to focus is attention on creating an incredibly twisted, bizarre and suspicious atmosphere to what is the centre of his characters wishes and conflicts-the Maxfield Academy. Undoubtedly, this is an odd place to be, guarded by both video cameras and a large group of students who somehow form an alliance against all others. There are three gangs in this school, the ones who take care of everything and are responsible for correcting what is out of place, the ones who enjoy creating chaos and the ones who are neither. Benson is a Variant, which means he is himself. He knows something is deeply wrong with the school and with the people who are in it, and soon realizes it was a mistake to accept that scholarship. But what are the secrets kept in between walls? I liked Benson, a lot. I found him to be the exact type of male protagonist I appreciate the most. He is curious but conscious of his limits, he is tough but also knows how to be protective, and he is not scared of going against everyone and everything if that's what he truly believes to be the right thing to do. That's why he's the one who gets more surprised about it, that's why he's the one who won't know in who to trust and confide. This book's best asset surely is its easy writing and the ambience that Wells created. I never saw it coming, I admit. I knew this was a dystopian novel but no one could have prepared me for all the questions and all the doubts and all the nervousness. And the coolest thing about it is that even when I though I finally knew what was going on and nothing else could ever surprise me, bamb!, new twist! That ending was absolutely to die for. What a cliffhanger. What a gigantic number of questions twirling around. What a torture to an avid reader like me! Variant is an outstanding reading and the kind of book that leaves a lot of doors open to its continuation. I haven't read Feedback yet but I can only hope for Wells to have picked the right paths to follow. A lot can happen after this first book and all I want is an equally interesting, exciting and complete page-turner reading-it's not too much to ask, right?",Patricia Pilar Pecegueiro
9780064472272,"This book had me laughing by page 2. Louise Rennison knows how to tell a fantastic story with relatable characters and plots. I found that I had a great deal in common with Ms. Georgia Nicholson. Her akward pre-teen phase reminded me very much of my own. I was taken back to when I first started wearing make-up and lip gloss in the hopes of impressing a boy. I also love how Louise depicts the crazy that is Georgia's family. I was quickly reminded of my own ""special"" family members and some of the hilarious moments that we have shared. I think everyone can relate to the angst that Georgia feels when she is embarrassed by her parents. Perhaps, the main reason why I love this book series is because Ms. Rennison always leaves you hanging, craving the next book. I can remember eagerly watching my calendar with the release date of the next book circled on my calendar. And the glossy of words that Ms. Rennison has created is not only helpful, it is hilarious!

9780312625207,"If you have already read Darynda's Charlie Davidson series then you already know how awesome she is and how fun her characters are. And if you haven't, huh, let me ask you: Why?! When I heard that she was writing a YA book I couldn't help but squee of happiness. And then I bought it as soon as I could to add it to my always growing TBR pile. And I finally got to read it. And loved it. For starters, our main character, Lorelei is a strong girl that has had her share of suffering. For the last ten years her parents have been missing and although her life with her grandparents is amazing she wishes for them to come back. And with the anniversary of their disappearance approaching she just wants to lay low and keep it together. Luckily for her she's got the two coolest best friends anyone could ask for. Brooke and Glitch are her sidekicks and she just knows that no matter what they've got her back. I'm a sucker for romance but when strong loyalty also appears in a story then the author has probably won my heart already. But if then you add funny/clever/my-stomach-hurts-after-laughing-so-much dialogues then girl, I'm in love with you. Then of course we have two amazingly hot and full of testosterone guys that become Lorelei's shadow. And if you are as tired as I am of love triangles you probably just flinched, right? I know I did. But no worries here, it doesn't happen at all :] As for the hot guys, there is Jared, the guy that Lorelei accidentally touched at the coffee shop and triggers a vision in her mind where he is fighting against a huge monster. Visions are not new to her as she can, sometimes, see the past or even the future. But monsters? That's definitely a new one. But when she tries to warn him he is gone. And yet she can't get him out of her mind and fears that she won't see him again... until he happens to be a new student in her high school. Instantly attracted to him she is dying to know who is he but they are quickly interrupted by Cameron, aka her personal stalker and the school's official loner, who claims it (Jared) is dangerous and shouldn't be trusted. From there the plot develops in a series of events that will leave you with a bunch of questions popping in your head, some of those being: Who are Jared and Cameron? What do they want from Lorelei? How did Jared bring back Lorelei after she died? I was so eager for answers that I enjoyed every second of the ride. And what a ride! It's obvious that there is some kind of past between Jared and Cameron as they use any situation to start throwing punches and kicks at each other. By the end of the book we do reach some answers... that lead to new questions. Because the ending will make you want to know what is going to happen next pronto. I think this is what I liked best about DATGND, at first it seems like a interesting and funny YA book but by the end of it a more promising and exciting series begins to unravel.",Alaiel Kreuz
9780312625207,"This was Darynda Jones first venture into the young adult world and I was impressed. I thoroughly enjoyed Death and the Girl Next Door. While maybe not perfect, there is a lot I can overlook when I have a host of fantastic characters to capture my attention, and that's what I found here. Lorelei, the protagonist, has two amazing best friends, Glitch and Brooklyn. So when Cameron begins to stalk her, and then Jared shows up and weird things start to happen, like her dying and being brought back to life, she has them to fall back on and tells them everything. Unlike a lot of books where the heroine will keep the secrets and loses her friends. And when Cameron and Jared start hanging out with these three, I enjoyed the banter, the sarcasm and wit really kept me entertained. There is a lot of mystery in this book. Lorelei's parents just disappeared one day ten years ago and no one knows what happened. Then, there's Cameron and Jared, who between them, seem to have a lot of secrets. There's a lot of questions that come up and not all of them are answered by the end of the book. I really enjoyed the touch of romance here too. Thankfully there's no love triangle though I did feel as though the cover hinted at one. With the revelations that came at the end of this book, I'm really looking forward to the next in the series, Death, Doom and Devotion and I'm expecting great things from it.",Suzanne Finnegan

The quirky sarcasm between Lorelei, Brooklyn and Glitch is wonderfully amusing! They say the things that I only dream of saying. Jared and Cameron are just the most mysterious and intriguing guys ever. I cannot wait to see where their relationship with Lorelei goes. Then we have Lorelei's grandparents.

It really kept me in suspense because I had no idea where it was all going. Then when I reached the end of the book I was so disappointed, I didn't want it to end!

9781442445802,"The Program is an intriguing and thought provoking first to a series that gave me all I wanted from it-romance, thrill and food for thought. I failed to completely connect with our main romantic couple, but in many ways I still consider it a great read. Given the heavy topic (suicides and depression oozing from the pages), I wasn't emotionally involved, and that is the only ""negative"" thing I have to say. The Program has a great composition. It consists of three parts (before, during and after). The events in each accentuate a motif, a certain repetitiveness in the human nature that challenges the idea of the Program, to wipe out all potentially triggering memories. The dystopian streak is not that prominent. The Program is still in experimental phase, implemented in a small number of states. The focus of the story is the romance between Sloane and James, both in the high risk population. It's an interesting situation to watch the characters before and after the treatment and follow the train of their thoughts. The main idea is, even if all your memories were eradicated, would you make the same 'mistakes'? If most of your past were simply deleted, how much of you would there still be in you? I was wondering all the time what would have to happen in the society to start such an avalanche of depression and suicide. Then there's the Program itself. While it's easy to adopt the characters' negative attitude toward it, Suzanne Young also gives you enough footage to see the upside of it. As a mother I had to ask myself what I would want for my child. Where is the morality of it if the patients have absolutely no choice? Is a clean and fresh start that horrifying an alternative to suicide? Is the cost of keeping your children alive living with barely more than a shell of its former self worth it? Read it and decide for yourself. The Program raises a lot of questions, but ends on a hopeful and promising note, especially considering the epilogue. The same character that at some point I thought was cheesy soars to heroic proportions, and I cannot wait to read more. (Source: Pulse It free read)",Ivana
9781442445802,"Wow... This book is heartbreaking, frustrating, dramatic, romantic and more. It was more then I expected, to be honest. Way more. And I loved every part of it. So in this book suicide is an epidemic. And the only 'cure' they could come up with is The Program. (Stupid donkeys... I may have a few ideas that could help you know. For instance... Stop the monkeys that are making those super kill pills or let people mourn when they've lost someone... Don't wipe their memory if they get depressed because it's actually your fault they are because they can't show their emotions the way they should... Okay, I'm stopping now. Moving on.) So you get it. The Program basically erases your memories. Takes the bad ones that make you 'sick' away. So if you show signs of being sick, they take you to one of the facilities and wipe your memory and then in the end you're happy again and all the bad stuff is gone. (I would rather take one of those kill pills instead of getting my memory wiped.) It's actually pretty original. But seriously. So many geniuses in the world and that's the best they could come up with? Tsss. So the main character in this story is Sloane. She is a really fun character and I loved her. I felt for her and I felt a lot. No kidding. The first part of the book is heartbreaking (the whole book is actually but okay). Her brother died, her best friend doesn't remember her, her other best friend dies and the boy she loves is taken from her too. Yeesh, talk about a hard life. But she is a fighter and she wants to hold on to James as long as she can. She doesn't want to forget. I love her for that. She's strong. The second half of the story is equally heartbreaking and a bit frustrating near the end. If you lose your memories, can you get them back? Does your heart remember what your mind forgot? That's the main question in the second half of the story. And it was so frustrating to know what she did not anymore. But I am sooo glad the way this book ended. And I can't wait for the next book. Oh and I love James. He's awesome and hot. And Realm is ... I don't know, I don't like him. Awesome book, I want the sequel. Like... Yesterday.",Bieke Paesen
9781442445802,"Brilliant! I was not expecting it to pack such an emotional punch, but man, did it ever. It is so chilling to think about a teenage epidemic of suicide! My father did it back in October, so I know all too well the ramifications of family and friends left behind. Suzanne did such a good job portraying that. The twist-- Sloane (the main character) and the other teens in this chilling world are being monitored for any signs of depression so they can't outwardly express their grief. I can only imagine not being able to cry for fear of losing all my memories. Because that is what happens to the teens who are deemed at risk of suicide. They are sent through the program, and while it erases the depression it also erases all memories from their life before. So, I can't decide which they mourn more, the ones who are gone through suicide or their friends or boy/girl friends that have gone through the program but don't remember them anymore. So sad! The dynamic of the characters was so well written and layered. Sloane and her boyfriend James used to run around with Lacey (taken into the program) and her boyfriend Miller. But James used to be a close friend of Sloane's brother Brady. So there is so much complex history and emotions driving their interactions. One of the scenes that really got to me was when Sloane injured herself just so she would be free to cry because she missed her brother who died and her best friend Lacey who just came out of the program and didn't remember Sloane or her boyfriend Miller. I adored the romance in this one. James and Sloane and their dynamic had me right away. I loved how they looked out for each other and provided the strength for the other when they were falling apart a bit, and glued them right back together. James is devoted and I was swooning all over him. Their teasing, banter, and loyalty had me cheering for them. Each part of this book hooked me in even more, and made me realize how much I liked Sloane's character. There are new characters that I didn't know whether to trust, and even by the end of the book I have no idea what their angle is on everything, and how this person will play into things in the next part. I love the line that if it is meant to be, it will happen. The first time I heard it I rolled my eyes, but I love how that is a theme, and the people that show up to prove that right, and things that happen more than once. I know that is vague, but I think that once you read it, you'll understand what I am talking about. It is so hard to review a book like this sometimes because so much happens that I want to talk about but, I also don't want to spoil anything. So I try to talk about what you can figure out from the synopsis or within the first couple of chapters. The pacing was amazing, and kept me in suspense waiting for the next bit of action, or seeing how the characters are growing. I loved this first book and will definitely be continuing this series. Bottom Line: Intense and emotional. I connected with Sloane and swooned over James.",Brandi Kosiner (Brandi Breathes Books)

I'm not going to go into detail because I don't want to spoil anything, but oh my God. My heart really broke when I read that first line about it. This book was a lot different than the first. Which took some time to getting used to. It was amazing though. Before picking this book up, I was saving it. I was saving it to read and then read the third and final book right after it. But after picking up several books and failing to read them during my Read-a-Thon, I knew I had to pick this up. Even though the books I had started and put down were books I was looking forward to reading. And it's not the books, it's just the complete rut I was in. I wanted to read, but just...couldn't. But wow, this really yanked me out of it! Belly has done a lot of growing up. A LOT. And so had Conrad, Jeremiah, and even Steven. How can you not with what happened? My heart goes out to them. There were a couple of small chapters in this book that was in Jeremiah's point-of-view, which I loved. I was glad to get into his head and wonder what was going on inside there.

The two have a tenuous relationship, but that all falls apart when Conrad's mother, Suzanne, dies. Suzanne was the bond that kept the two families close. Each summer, they would be together at the house at Cousins' Beach. Now, with Suzanne gone, the threads are unraveling. Belly receives a call a few months after the funeral from Conrad's brother, Jeremiah. Conrad has gone missing from summer school at Brown. He asks Belly to help him try to find Conrad.

9780552566148,"Writing a review for ACID is gonna be a bit tough, not because I don't think it is a brilliant book, that it is, but because I think this is one of those reviews that must be absolutely spoiler free, and that's gonna be hard to pull off! ACID is a purely dystopian tale, with a touch of science fiction due to the future time setting, but it doesn't have the usual post-apocalyptic undertones of other dystopians. Here there was no worldwide catastrophe, here humanity doesn't have to start from scratch, here there was a bid for power at a vulnerable moment in history, and a country has been shaped at those powers' will. There are some elements that would remind me of 1984 and even A Brave New World, in the way society has been changed, and in how fear & lies are what keep the populace under control. ACID is Jenna Strong's story but not only hers. Jenna does honour her last name, she's a very strong and resilient character. I loved having a main character that was a female and kicked arse! But the best thing about ACID is not just having a strong female character as the main character, the best thing about ACID was how it kept managing to surprise me at every twist of the story! I kept expecting the story to go one way, turned the page and bam! I had been thrown a curve ball and was surprised. Time after time! And that's also the main reason I don't want to discuss plot much during the review, cause I don't want to let anything slip!

9780756966034,"I am so drawn to Mythology its the most intriguing subject I've ever learned about. So once i started reading this one i knew i had to read the rest. Percy is an extraordinary character. Rick Riordan keeps blowing my mind over and over again with every single chapter. I was hesitant to start reading this book since I don't really know what to expect going into a book where the main character is under 15 years old, but as soon as i started it i couldn't wait till i finished it to go onto the next one. I seriously didn't want to put it down at all. A lot of people compare it to Harry Potter although there is a lot of things throughout the book that would remind you of The Harry Potter series its kind of different on its own level. The plot was really really well written I enjoyed every minute I got to read this book I loved it. Percy was a bad tempered, smart ass kind of kid. His character although young made you really get into the book and keep reading, you could relate to him on so many levels so it made you really enjoy it. Although his mouth got him into a lot of trouble I still liked that he stood up for what he thought was right, he tried so hard to protect Grover and himself from bullies and all the dangerous things they were about to face on the quest. Even though he missed his mom more with each passing day he knew he had to focus on getting himself and his friends out of danger. He was basically made up of bravery, kindness, and tenacity. Rick Riordan brought to life so many amazing characters they each had their own personality and they were each given a story, and it was way better than I had expected. Annabeth was one of my favorite characters she was strong willed and powerful in so many ways. She made me laugh and trust me there was a bit of tear jerker moments when she talked about her dad. Grover is also another one of my list of characters that I love he just keeps getting better and better with each passing page. You can tell how he continues to grow throughout the book, at first you see him as this scared Satyr but he really matures and he's braver by the end of the book.",Ana

9780142404249,"Sixteen-year-old Hope Yancey has lived a very nomadic life. Her mother Deena, a waitress who originally named her Tulip, didn't want the responsibility of raising a baby, left her with her Aunt Addie, Deena's older sister and a cook, and went off to live on her own. Hope remembers seeing her mom only three times. Addie and Hope have worked in Atlanta, GA, where Hope was a girl scout for three months; St. Louis, MO, where she changed her name from Tulip to Hope; the Rainbow Diner in Pensacola, SC, where Hope moved from bus girl to waitress; the Ballyhoo Grill in South Carolina; and the Blue Box in Brooklyn, NY, where Addie was a partner with owner Gleason Beal. In fact, Hope has lived in five different states and gone to six different schools. However, Gleason has run off with Addie's money, along with the night waitress, for parts unknown, forcing the restaurant in Brooklyn to be closed down. So now, Addie and Hope are headed to Mulhoney, WI, on the outskirts of Milwaukee, to work at the Welcome Stairways diner, owned by Gabriel Thomas (G. T.) Stoop, a 54-year-old man whose wife Gracie had died a few years before and who himself is being treated for leukemia. Addie and Hope have their hands full when G. T. decides to run for mayor against the unscrupulous incumbent Eli Millstone. A romantic interest develops between Hope and the eighteen-year-old Eddie Braverman who also cooks at the diner, as well as one between Addie and G. T. But will G. T. recover from his illness? Who will win the election? And what will happen to Addie and Hope? The possible objectionable elements in this book are not too many. Aside from a few common euphemisms (gee, kick butt), the terms Lord. God, and Jesus are frequently used as interjections, but there is no actual cursing. In one scene, Hope is accosted by the Carbinger brothers, but nothing really happens as she is rescued by Deputy Sheriff Babcock. My major concern with the overall theme of the book is the picture of family. Hope has never met her father and doesn't even know his name. In fact, her mother says that she doesn't know who he is either. Addie's no-good husband Malcolm left her for a thin-lipped dental hygienist. Braverman's daddy walked out on the family. One of the other waitresses, Lou Ellen, has a baby Anastasia, who ""doesn't have a daddy either."" I know that these kinds of situations do occur, but reading modern children's and youth literature, you might get the impression that they are the norm. Why do today's writers feel that they must present nearly every family as dysfunctional? Thankfully, everything turns out nicely in the end, but there's a lot of baggage to deal with along the way to get there. If one is willing to wade through all that, there is actually a good story in Hope Was Here, and I think that I can understand why it was a Newbery Honor Book in 2001 with its messages of needing ""hope,"" the importance of character, and having vision for the future, but it is definitely a story for teens and not for younger children.",Wayne S. Walker
9780142404249,"HOPE WAS HERE is a brilliant book by an equally brilliant author, Joan Bauer. When I read this book for the first time (my copy is worn; I've read it so often!), I was an instant fan of the author. HOPE WAS HERE is worth your time, worth your money, and worth anything else that you have to do to get your hands on this book. Hope is a sixteen-year-old waitress who has lived all across America with her Aunt Addie. Hope's mother (who, upon seeing her tiny baby for the first time, named her Marigold, of all things. Addie's twelfth birthday present to her niece was a name change.) has long been out of the picture, visiting only occasionally with tidbits of advice. Waitressing at the diner in Brooklyn was great for Hope, but, like all good things, it comes to an end. The owner stole all of the money and ran off, leaving Addie and Hope with nothing. The two of them boarded up the windows, and, just before driving off, Hope left her mark: Hope Was Here, in blue ballpoint pen at the edge of one of the boards. Addie and Hope are off to a small town in Wisconsin. When they get there, they meet G.T., the owner of the local diner where Addie will be cooking and Hope will be waitressing. G.T is a man the town loves, and he's going to run for mayor and change things. The current mayor, a scheming, dishonest typical politician, isn't standing for that, though. He's got to bring up how G.T. has leukemia, and is dying. How, he says, can a man who is dying take care of an entire town? He might not be alive in a few months. G.T. isn't alone, though. Hope, Addie, and countless others are trying to get him elected, so that he can do some good for the town. Even though things are hard, they've still got to have hope. This novel is amazing. HOPE WAS HERE is a book that you will not read only once, but over and over. It sticks with you. Part of this is due to the well thought-out characters, especially Hope. She is a strong character, but also a strong person. She's been through a lot, and she's still around, serving up food to hungry customers. Her waitressing jobs have a lot to do with who Hope is. Maybe to some people (you know the type--not good enough unless you've got a diploma from Harvard), waitressing seems like a dead-end job, but this book shows different sides of it. HOPE WAS HERE is a page-turner that will keep you riveted from the first word (which happens to be ""somehow""), to the last (""had""), and when it's over, you'll want more. Luckily for us, Joan Bauer has written several other books for young adults, including BACKWATER, RULES OF THE ROAD, and SQUASHED. They're just as good as HOPE WAS HERE, too, and that's saying something! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781442422018,"THE PLEDGE pairs dystopian setting with a classical form of government, the monarchy. Kimberly Derting takes us to a future world ruled by Queen Sabara. To the land of Ludania, where people are divided by their language. They could be executed if they ever try to speak or understand another than their own language. Those numerous languages were occasionally mentioned, unfortunately we dont get a sample of their sounds. Its an interesting concept that Kimberly Derting gave a woman the power to rule the kingdom and decide over life and death. We are fast introduced to all the rules and restrictions determining daily life of citizens and our heroine Charlaina. She understands every language and that mystery really got me. How come she can do that? I was so eager to find out what was behind that special ability of hers. The story is told from two point of views. Our main character is Charlie who tells the story in the perspective of 1st person narrator. Then we got a third person POV of the Queen which creates a great contrast between protagonist and antagonist. It took some time for the story to lure me in. Since that one point where a few secrets and a growing romance start becoming a more dominant part of the story, I got more involved in Charlie's story. Unfortunately sometimes the love story between Charlie and that guy, Max, felt a bit too vague. Kimberly Derting captures the moment of Charlie being on the fence about her growing feelings for Max, but at some point Charlies struggles were just too much for me to take any longer. It was not that turbulent and cute love story that Im a fan of, but effortlessly fit the overall style of THE PLEDGE. THE PLEDGE shows that the same author can write books that couldnt be more different. Im a huge fan of Kimberly Dertings THE BODY FINDER series and am a bit spoiled when it comes to mystery-action factor and super sweet romance. THE PLEDGE is much slower in pace and even Kimberlys writing, which I know is really really good, didnt feel that impressive in her first book in the THE PLEDGE series. 3,5/5 ***/* THE PLEDGE- A dystopian read, highlighted by historical character! THE PLEDGE is definitely no comparison to Kimberly Dertings THE BODY FINDER series, which is one of my favourites. Several moments of surprise, a well developed course of actions and the general good intuition for an interesting world though, make THE PLEDGE a book worth giving a try.",MissPageTurner
9781442422018,"4.5 stars Ludania is a country made up of classes kind of like we have in our world -- upper, middle, and lower. But the similarities end there. The classes in Ludania are very strict and you are not really allowed to mingle with another class -- right down to there being completely separate languages within the upper classes just to segregate those below them in rank. But while the upper classes may seem to rule the society, they are all ruled by a single queen, and this queen is not a softy. When I first dived into The Pledge, I was excited because a few friends had told me it was very good. But then again there were also some not-so-good reviews for it as well. So going in I wasn't sure what to expect entirely. The common trend with the negative reviews though seemed to be when comparing it to Derting's Body Finder series. But I haven't read her Body Finder series yet (although it's on my list), so I didn't have that to compare it to. Perhaps that's a good thing because I really loved this book. This was a book that was very hard for me to put down once I picked it up. It's fast-paced for most of the book, which I really liked. Ludania is sort of in the middle of a revolution, so there's a lot of external stuff going on outside of Charlie's personal life. Of course, her own little world is about to collide with the big one around her, but that's for you to discover if you decide to read this book. But anyways, I loved the pacing and the writing style flowed very well and was easy to get hooked into. Charlie was sort of your typical underdog heroine in the beginning. She has the oh-so-pretty friend who get's all the guys' attention and Charlie's left in the shadows. It's been a bit overdone, but I think that's because most of us have felt that way at one point or another so it's easy to relate to. But Charlie holds her own too. She may be of a lower class and she may be the underdog of her little clique, but she's strong and level-headed. She's a good person and being inside her head was a pleasure. Of course, the nice thing about this book is that we get more than just Charlie's point-of-view. We get several others as well. My other favorite would probably be Max. I really loved his character. He's very sweet and romantic and even though Charlie pushes him away for pretty valid trust reasons, he doesn't give up, which I loved. So overall I really enjoyed this one and had a hard time putting it down. I was thinking it was five-star material for most of the book, but the ending felt a little too abrupt for me. Although there will be more books in the series and it didn't really leave off with a cliffhanger. But I still felt like the ending was kind of rushed compared to the pacing in the rest of the book. Even so, I loved it overall and I will definitely be reading on in the series!",I'm Loving Books
9781442422018,"Once I started reading The Pledge, I couldn't stop! I didn't think that I would like this book as much as I did, because something about the description of the language barrier in the blurb didn't connect with me, but once I started reading Charlie's story, I fell in love with her character and had to know more. Derting is a master of characters, I was suspicious yet charmed by Max, fiercely wanting to protect Angelina, and not only that, she is great at giving only the information you need in that moment, and not a smidge more to keep me asking questions, being surprised, and needing to know more. The world building and the pacing was great, and this makes me think that I have really missed something by not reading The Body Finder. There were so many things that I wasn't expecting that effected the storyline and it's a pleasant surprised to be completely blindsided by things like that when I can sometimes sniff a dystopia ""twist"" a mile away.

9781442436640,"Poison Princess (The Arcana Chronicles #1) by Kresley Cole After reading the first few pages of Poison Princess, I was not sure I was going to like it. I am so glad I kept reading it. This book was amazing. Plus, in retrospect, the beginning of the novel was perfect. The novel starts out in the home of this creepy mad scientist named Arthur, after the apocalypse, better known as A.F. (After the Flash). Arthur keeps girls chained in his basement where he conducts experiments on them, including the removal of body parts. Our main character, sixteen-year-old Evangeline (Evie) Greene, was lured to his home. He gives her lunch and drugged tea in a quest to add her to his victims. While they are eating, Arthur video tapes, Evie and asks her to talk about her life before the flash. Uncertain and timid Evie tells her story. Her mother found her journal where she drew all her visions of the apocalypse. While her friends were vacationing over the summer, her mother had secretly placed Evie in a mental institution. Now back at school Evie tries to lead a normal life where she is a cheerleader, her boyfriend, Brandon Radcliffe, is a football player, and she is popular. Of course, readjusting is not easy. She is partnered with irritating but attractive transfer student, Jackson Deveaux, in a year-long history project. Evie continues to tell her story about after the flash. Evie needs to get to her grandmother to find out about her destiny. Jack becomes her protector and guide. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll stop there. I have always enjoyed reading Kresley Cole's work. She is a talented paranormal and fantasy writer. To date, this is my favorite of her novels. This book has everything: fantasy, mystery, suspense, horror, apocalypse, zombies, supernatural, magic, class-conflicts, and love-triangles. I'll be looking forward to the next book in the series Endless Knight released on October 1, 2013.",Diane Lynch
9781442436640,"I want to start off by saying that the audiobook version of this book was presented amazingly well. Emma Galvin was fantastic as the main narrator and conveyed a real sense of Evie's character. Keith Nobbs did his part so well it was scary - he embodied creepiness itself. I love the premise of this book and how tarot cards are used to hold it all together - it is brilliant. Evie has hallucinations and her mom thinks she's crazy, just like her grandmother. However, it turns out that Evie is one of the Major Arcana, the power cards, of a tarot deck. When the apocalypse comes, Evie and her mother realize that the hallucinations were actually visions. There are voices in Evie's had that speak to her. Then Jack comes along, a poor, rough, Cajun boy. Evie and Jack have to work together to try to find Evie's grandmother in the craziness that is left of the world - bagmen (zombies), soldiers, cannibals, plague, no vegetation,... I alternately liked and disliked both Evie and Jack. There were many times I found them extremely frustrating. Evie spent a lot of time being weak and confused and even whiny. I can see why this was, and I appreciate her growth (and anticipate she will be a much stronger character in the next book), but felt it did go on a bit. Then there is Jack, the ultimate bad boy. He and Evie clearly love each other, even if they can't stand each other. He is rude, rough, tough, can fight and survive on the land, drinks, rides a motorcycle. You get the picture. Again, I found that maybe this stereotype went a bit far. However, I loved the parts about the visions and the tarot deck, the voices and the Arcana. And Cole's writing is beautiful. Her use of language is stunning and completely drew me in. Her descriptions are vivid and engaging. I think those who like dystopian novels will enjoy this different, almost paranormal, take. Despite my frustrations with the two main characters, I did like them and the book enough to eagerly anticipate the next installment.",Coreena McBurnie
9781442436640,"Poison Princess by Kresley Cole is a goooood book. And I don't mean that like, ""It's a good book, you should read it."" I mean it as in, it's now in my top five favorite books of all time! It's like an epic mix of the contemporary, post apocalyptic, romance and paranormal genres that will certainly be a favorite with many. The way Cole introduces us to the main characters before the apocalypse, lets us see their world in detail, makes the devastation of the Flash that much more real. It's something many post-apocalyptic novels don't bother with but it made me enjoy Evie's story so much more. Evie Greene is a strong character right from page one. Even though Evie is portrayed as a good girl she's not a saint like many heroines who are portrayed as being good. She's a sixteen year old girl and she can be as big of an idiot, or coo-y???'n as Jackson would say, as anyone. But she steps up when she's needed. She chooses good over evil and tries to make those around her happier. She has this deadly power growing inside of her, yet she holds back, trying to remain normal. I know, I know. Another paranormal heroine who denies her power because she wants to be ""normal"". Cliche, except in Poison Princess it doesn't feel cliche. It feels like Evie struggling to remain Evie and not become a monster. After the cliffhanger at the end, I can only imagine how Evie is going to grow and change in the upcoming books. Let's talk about Jackson. (If I could talk about Jackson for the next three years I'd be totally fine with that.) Jackson Deveaux is the boy who put the bad in bad boy. He's a hot, motorcycle ridin', crossbow totin' Cajun with a chip on his shoulder and he's the only protection Evie's got against the world post-Flash. And what protection he is! As Evie says, as long as Jackson's got his crossbow, he's the bogeyman that everyone should steer clear of. Jackson... Well, I'll just come out and say it. Jackson can be an all-mighty douchebag from time to time. If you've read Jennifer Armentrout's Lux series and thought Daemon Black was a jerk, Daemon's a cuddly, little kitten compared to good ole Jack. But, he's got his reasons for being a jerk to Evie. (I mentioned that chip on his shoulder, right?) I love me a bad boy with an attitude problem, so Jackson was my kind of guy, right from the get go. But if you had a problem with Daemon from the Lux series as I've heard some people have (I don't understand it, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion), than I can almost guarantee that you'll want to reach through the pages of Poison Princess and strangle Jackson. You might want to do that even if you like him. He's sort of strangle-able. The way Poison Princess was structured was very interesting. I can't remember ever reading a book where you're introduced to the main character through a random, evil secondary character. The prologue begins with Arthur, a young man who is trying to catch Evie in a trap in order to do horrible experiments on her. Getting her to tell him her story so he can remember what it was like before the Flash (while really he's taking a patient history-yeah, this guy is really sick). It was very unique and had you wondering what was going to happen, since the entire time Evie's telling her story you know that it's somehow leading her right into this psycho's lair (his word, not mine-told you he was sick). I will admit, the only thing I wasn't truly a fan of in this book was the way the scenes with Arthur seemed to condescend to the reader. It's written in a way that basically says, ""This is a bad guy. He's evil. You should hate him."" I know that Arthur is a very condescending douchewad all on his own, but still. It could have been a little less obvious. Really, even though he plays an important role in Evie's character development, he's not a huge part of the novel itself, so this isn't a major complaint. Arthur and his figurative ""I'm an evil-doer"" neon sign was the only thing about Poison Princess that felt obvious to me. I couldn't seem to ever guess what was going to happen next. When I finally reached the last few pages of the novel I was shaking with anticipation. The end is a huge game changer for Evie and I couldn't help but be anxious for her. I'd love to talk more about this (like have a full-on drool fest and then a good whine about certain events) but I don't want to give away any spoilers, because you'll want to discover the secrets of Poison Princess all on your own. If you're a lover of contemporary but are a little iffy when it comes to paranormal, I'd recommend giving Poison Princess a try. It's written so realistically, easing you into the apocalypse and all of the magic elements, while at the same time not watering it down for fans of paranormal. With a spunky heroine who's equal parts strong, funny and deceptively deadly everyone is sure to fall in love with this story. Plus, there's a hot Cajun. That alone is enough to read this book, trust me.",Pretty In Fiction
9781442436640,"Whoa. Disturbing, dark, dangerous, terrifying, heartbreaking, and AMAZING! At first I wanted to run from the creepy book. From the terrifying world it held. But I persevered because it has spellbinding characters and a unique story. So much mystery and the temptation that one more page might hold the answer. By the end I am not sure you could have pried the book from my fingers. Finally a book that makes me fall in love with the bayou or more specifically Jackson. He is infuriating at nearly every turn and so very addictive. A small listen to his accent and you will be hooked. A bad boy so smokin' you will wonder how any other could possibly hold a flame to him. Evie is so perfectly disguised. Innocent and weak in appearance and mind but when push comes to shove she is anything but. The romantic tension is absolutely sizzling off the charts. Wowzer! An apocalypse like you have never seen and scarely dared envision in your darkest nightmares. So vivid, so cruel, and somehow all too realistic feeling. It leaves you wondering what if this really happened? How would I fare? The ending is stunning and will leave you raw. A dark journey that is not to be missed. The future promises more darkness and betrayal. Enough heartache to drown in and next to no prospect of happiness. Regardless, I will gladly, if not patiently, stand in line for more.

9780061441684,"I'm a major fan of Kim Harrison's The Hollows series. In fact, I think she is one of the top Urban Fantasy writers out there. I was very much looking forward to her new YA series about a dead girl whose afterlife turns utterly complicated. I think I might be a tad spoiled due to my love for KH's other books, that I was left a bit unsatisfied with the first book in this series. You really jumped right into Madison's afterlife without really finding out a ton about the world she now lives in. And once you learn more, it doesn't really seem very interesting at the moment, in my opinion. I hope the plot and the world gets flushed out more later on. I read that there is a short story in the Prom Nights from Hell anthology that gives the background on Madison, so it might make sense to read it first. I don't feel very attached to Madison, at this point. I do like her, but I don't feel like she's a very significant person in her own series...yet. She is spunky though, and doesn't sit around, waiting for afterlife to just take care of itself. She is a fighter (albeit a very scared one!), curious and a problem solver. Oh, and she has purple tips on her hair, which is uber cute. I also loved the ""when I hit ctrl + alt + del"" line."" That is definitely something a young person would say today. I must say I do love Grace. She is definitely the equal to Jenks' character in The Hollows. While not as snarky as Jenks, Grace provides some comic relief and I grew to really like her. Again though, no real connection to anyone else. I think Nakita and Barnabus' relationship is going to prove to be entertaining though. Conclusion: 3/5 stars. I liked it, but it wasn't a book that had me sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation, or daydreaming about it. I will continue the series because of my love for KH. I just hope things pick up, make more sense, become more substantial, etc. I do like the themes of fate / free will, light / dark, fallen angels, etc. I'm still a bit confused as to who is good and who is evil, but that is some of the fun of the book.",Smash Attack
9780061345746,"It's 1900 in New York, and scandal and gossip are never far behind. Elizabeth Holland is back and everyone is awaiting her re-entrance into society. But things are not as they seem in No. 17 Gramercy Park. Elizabeth and her sister, Diana, are both grieving the loss of their loved ones. When the sisters are invited along on a trip to Florida by the newly married Schoonmakers, they decide this is the perfect escape. Penelope Schoonmaker isn't pleased to invite the woman her husband is in love with along on her trip, but she knows she must keep her enemies close if she's ever going to get what she wants. Carolina Broad is climbing high in society, but her place is not secure and her newfound fame and fortune could disappear any moment. I've been addicted to the LUXE series since it began, and ENVY continues to add more gossip and scandal to the story. I thought the twists and turns in ENVY moved the story along quicker than the previous two stories. I loved that the author moved a lot of the action to Florida - it added new scenery and lots of fun situations. There were many times I told myself ""just one more chapter"" because I needed to know what would happen next. Each chapter tells a part of the story from a different character and I found myself enjoying each storyline this time around. Yes, I still wanted to yell at Penelope, would get annoyed at Carolina's social climbing, and tell Diana not to make so many assumptions, but I think that's part of the fun of the series. Anna Godbersen does such a great job at getting the readers involved in the characters that you can't help but cheer them on, or even root against them. I also thought there were some characters this time around who got stronger and started to stand up for themselves, so I'm eager to see where they end up. I will be first in line to get my hands on a copy of SPLENDOR, the next book in the LUXE series, when it's released.",TeensReadToo
9780385733571,I just loved the imagination and daring that Michael Scott has. He's shown it so well in the book beautifully portraying characters and storyline. I feel that I am getting Tolkeins detail (to a lesser extent) mixed with a mature storyline (insert author here). Written (I think) for 12+ but adults may enjoy the edpth and intellligence of it. I give it a four because it doesn't have quiet enough pace and takes time to develop. Having said that I am a hard judge so can't bring it up to 5- more a 9/10...,Kirsty McKellar
9780316025065,"Wow, this book truly blew me away, however that only happened in the later half of the book. I started reading this book way back in January, however I was so frustrated with many of the characters that i stopped reading. Now i'm glad I picked it up for my readathon and finished it. This story speaks to the millions of women who feel insecure about themselves, who feel that they are ""never good enough"" and only want to gain the superficial beauty the media has been feeding down our throats these days. It also speaks to the women who have been always put down by a supposed loved one, who have been verbally abused and made fun of and made to believe that they are nothing and never will be anything or achieve anything great. As you can see this story touched my heart in a way other books didn't. I am a huge feminist and coming from a region where they aren't big on women's rights, you might see how this book affected me. At first I was frustrated with Terra for never sticking up for herself and also for her mom for silently taking such verbal abuse and belittling from her supposed husband. It also frustrated me that Terra's two older brothers couldn't leave the house fast enough and were always on the sidelines watching, and never actually stopping their father, who has become more as a figure for everything they hated about their lives than an actual father. When Terra and her mom met Jacob and his mom, their journey for the acceptance they always wanted and the realization that this all comes within themselves began. Terra was the fighter between the two. Her mom always stood behind her, as if the roles were reversed. Through this journey, which brought them all the way to China, Terra came to realize the true meaning of beauty and her mom saw herself as a person that is worthy to be loved, and accepted for who she is. This book had me thinking so much, days after I finished it, I wished that I could become as strong as Terra was in the end. I wished that there is a way to reach out to women stuck in these situations, and for people to accept themselves and love themselves, because every single person is beautiful, you just need to look for the true beauty to see it. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a book with a deep message. However there is a romance element in this book, and while i crave for those in books in general, all i wanted to read about here is the journey of these two women, and where it would take them.",Juhina & Farah
9780316025065,"Can a perfect body make up for an imperfect face? Terra Cooper hopes so, though she knows that no matter how great her figure is, it won't stop people from staring at her port-wine stain. Her birthmark has always haunted her, a stubborn red splotch marring her face, that won't go away no matter how many expensive laser treatments she undergoes. The latest technology always loses the battle with Terra's face. Terra's birthmark isn't her only problem, though. If only life were that simple. Although Terra is accepted into Williams College, her first choice East Coast school, her father says it is out of the question. What he doesn't understand is that his overbearing presence is a big contributing factor to why Terra longs to flee from Washington. She would feel guilty for leaving her mom alone to fend for herself against her father's never-ending onslaught of insults. However, like her older brothers, Terra wants nothing more than to leave and start someplace fresh. With a dysfunctional family and a boyfriend, Erik, that knows her body far better than he knows her, Terra has nothing to anchor her in Colville, Washington. When Terra inadvertently (quite literally) runs into a Goth Chinese boy and his coffee bean mogul mother, her life takes an interesting turn. Jacob understands her in ways that Erik could never even aspire to. It's almost eerie how clearly he sees past her facades and can read her mind. Is it cheating to visit China with a boy who is not your boyfriend? How about if your mother and his mother are along for the ride? Justina Chen Headley seems to get better with each book she writes, and NORTH OF BEAUTIFUL is by far her strongest work thus far. Headley never oversimplifies emotions or situations, and even her periphery characters have impressive depth. With an eclectic mix of cartography, collage-making, and geocaching, she paints a tender story with hipster flair. Headley celebrates Terra's successes and strengths as well as her struggles and vulnerability with a complexity rarely achieved in literature. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9780930193881,"When you discover a new brilliant title there are two sad questions you must ask yourself. Will it continue to be this great and how long do I get until the end finally comes. The great news here that volume two is just as fantastic as the first and there are 27 more volumes ahead. That's more than Preacher, Y: the Last Man, Powers and all the other extraordinary epics. This is shaping up to be an incredible tale. Even though it is told with animals in the art the characterisation, plot and the emotion that infuses this piece is fantastic. This is comics at their finest with engaging storyline and captivating characters. You really want to know both what happens next and how did we get here. Stan Sakai satisfies both illuminating Usagi's childhood and deepening his relationship with Gen the bounty hunter. The art is incredible with crisp clean lines meticulously drawn. There is no hint of anything being rushed to meet a deadline and not a pen-stroke is out of place. This shows you just how much depth and texture you can get with two colours. It feels very appropriate to the setting and would not benefit from being in colour. Getting clear facial expressions is difficult enough on humans bet getting a bunny to emote is clearly a work of genius because Stan manages it. From the first few pages that are entirely devoid of dialogue to the Kurosawa and Godzilla tributes this is a delight to enjoy from start to finish. A true Double Thumbs Up!",365 Graphic Novels
9781250044617,"I wanted to read Eternal because I like C.C. Hunter's writing style as well as getting to know Della even more in the last one. She is a strong and independent young lady, and I love her snarky humor. It was neat to see Shadow Falls through new eyes, because I read the original series with Kylie, and while she is a great character, she is a different species as well as different personality types. We get to see the side of Della that wasn't wholly apparent in the other series. She begins to crave and enjoy opening up to Miranda and Kylie as well as the hugs and contact. We also get to see her and Burnett working together and get to see her loyalty through working with FRU and also Chase, who works for the Vampire Council. There are a lot of debates with the two about being faithful to their respective agencies as well as trying to sell the good points and get the other to switch over. Della and Chase also have a lot of time together in this one, both working together, exploring their bond as well as the growing attraction between them. It was def Chase's book as we got to see her with Steve in the last one. There were some pretty hot scenes between the two as they worked together to figure out the ghost that is trying to guide Della to save a boy and girl who is trapped and dying. Holiday and Kylie try to convince Della that Natasha, the girl in Della's vision is dead since that has been their experience but Della and Chase have the visions where they are in Natasha and Liam's heads and the ghost seems to indicate that they are alive. Della's family is interwoven in this one in ways that I never expected. Of course, Della is mourning Chan but then she learns more about her dad, uncle, aunt as well as a family member that she never would have expected. It is hard to see Della struggling with the relationship with her dad. He is strict and thinks that Della has shamed the family but she just remembers their bond and she wants to still please him and not to be seen as a failure and shame to the family. There was plenty of action, and I loved seeing Della's confidence and strength when its the right time to use it. She is a tough gal and being reborn, she has extra strength and its awesome seeing her kick butt. It was coupled with her growing as a character, realizing the need and how much she loves her friendships, having a mentor in Burnett and Holiday and figuring out her feelings for the two guys competing for her love and attention. The ending killed me as usual because it ties up some aspects but then drops a bomb where I was like wait. What? Why? Dang it I am going to have to wait WAY too long to figure out if its how it looks or what possible explanation is there for stopping THERE and what was he doing. Okay. I think I am done with caps lock. Maybe. Bottom Line: Great installment.

While I am sad to see this series end I am happy with how everything turned out. In this one, Nora seems to take more control of her life. She has decided that she needs to step up and take charge to become a true leader to her followers. Dante has started training Nora, even though sometimes she wishes he wouldn't. Marcy moves in with Nora and her mom. This is an interesting story line since they are have been enemies for a long time. Nora and Patch's relationship is tested multiple times again. Secrets are revealed and some new characters are introduced to us. Patch is swoon worthy as always which I love. Can you tell Patch is like my favorite? There are some good action scenes along with betrayal, struggles and some major twists and turns. I didn't totally love it but overall I really enjoyed it and thought the ending was great.",Unknown
9781442426672,"I read the three previous books in the Hush, Hush series before I started my blog so I didn't review them but I have to tell you that I absolutely loved them all, this is by far my favourite angel series so I had been eagerly awaiting the release of Finale and couldn't wait to start reading once I finally got my hands on it! I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed because this was another amazing read, I literally couldn't put the book down and read it in less than a day. Once again I immersed myself in Nora's world and loved every single second of it! The story was action-packed from the start, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout. The characters, who I had become so familiar with in the previous books, were just as interesting as always and the addition of a few new characters kept things fresh. Dante was a very interesting character who intrigued me and my opinion of him changed many times as I was reading. I enjoyed seeing Nora grow in strength and confidence, she finally seemed to know who she wanted to be even if some of her choices were unexpected. Patch was as strong and sexy as always, he really is an easy character to fall for! There were a few shocks towards the end that made me gasp out loud, this led nicely up to a tense battle and I have to admit that there were times when I couldn't decide which side I was on. By the end I felt a bit emotional (I always seem to feel like this at the end of a series that I have loved) and, although there was one part that I thought should have been different, I felt happy that it had ended in a satisfactory way.

9781421538204,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. A heart-thumping, fast-paced, plot driven volume. This entry in the series had me flipping the pages as fast as I could read/take in each page. Events are full of emotion as the story gets back to the whole overall big picture, which hasn't been touched upon in recent volumes. We meet a new character who becomes emotionally involved in the story right away. The return of many familiar faces make for a good story with a final showdown between good and evil. Yet, questions arise as to whether the evil is really the enemy, sure there methods are despicable but do they stem from good intentions. Personally, my ethics state that the ends never vindicate the means, however this changes the viewpoint of certain characters. The question of Amberground's government's role in all this is once again brought up and this volume lets us know that we will once again be returning to Capitol City, where we've only been once before, in the next volume: ""The Dead Letter Office"". This volume keeps the story fresh and has me anxious for the next book. Still my favourite manga I'm reading at the moment.",Nicola Mansfield

9780007319909,"In fact, I have read this book a couple of times, not recently though. I have this book on my bookshelf for about a few years now and I read it when I don't know what to read. I have the Dutch copy, because when I bought the book, I didn't know English just yet. I've been planning read the original version for quite some time now, but I didn't really got around it, and I actually forgot it once I got around reading. So I'll put it on my reading list and see when I get around reading this one in the original language. Now, I'm just going to review the Dutch version in English. I dont' think there is a lot of difference between the two. The title differences a bit, so do probably the names and some parts in the book (but I'm not sure). There are always a lot of translation errors, but as young me, didn't know English, I didn't notice. The book is about Ginny, who receives an envelope from her Aunt Peg in the mail, containing a $1000 in cash and a letter with instructions. The instructions are specific; no cell phones, no maps, and Ginny can only open one envelope at a time, after she's completed each task in the previous letter. Throughout the letters, Ginny learns more about what drove her aunt to flee to Europe in pursuit of her art and about Aunt Peg's last year of her life, since Aunt Peg has passed away from a brain tumor by the time the first envelope arrives. Just thinking about it. Ginny has parents. Would her parents leave a 17-year old girl alone traveling all over Europe because her dead aunt sent her a letter saying so? I don't think my mother would let me do something. She'd go with me. Ginny could not bring her cell phone, which would drive my parents crazy, they want to know where I'm at and what I'm doing and I wouldn't even be able to call the police or an ambulance when I'm in need. Yes, making up things that might happen when I would be alone without a cell phone with only a thousand bucks. Just trying to point out the non-realism in this book. Overall, it's a fine book, Maureen Johnson's writing is not perfect and can get slightly annoying at times, but it's nice, for younger teens and for those who really enjoy reading 'chicklit' books, which I don't particularly enjoy. It was a book that is nice to read when you don't really want to read something you have to think about. Or when you're tired and feel like reading some easy, and flowing. Something you can finish in a day. Then this is a good book. What appears to be, is that there was a part two made of the book (which I thought it should, I mean, this book has an open ending I bloody hated). I picked up the book from the library, maybe last year, or two years ago, but I didn't finish it, due to the lack of motivation to read. So I am planning to read that as well and fixing my review when I have read them both, in Dutch and in English. I can pick out the translation flaws. I must say, that Ginny, the main character, wasn't developed well in the book. We didn't know a lot about the character, we didn't get to learn how she was feeling through all of this. It was as if she was emotionless for some reason. One thing I didn't really enjoy about it. I am not sure whether to recommend it or not, because I used to really enjoy this book, but now I'm slightly older and realizing what a mad idea it is to travel through Europe without any phone etc. So I'm not sure if I still like it that much.",Sandra Beekhuis
9781478223887,"This is specifically a Tributary review: What a great way to end my favorite series!! I think it was the last book anyway. There was just the right amount of closure. I will miss reading about the lives of these amazing characters: Gabi, Marcello, Lia, Luca, Rodolfo. I still stand by my declaration that this is my all time favorite series! Even though Luca's picture was on the cover I think it told more of Lord Rodolfo Greco's story. Greco was such a great character. We've been through a lot with him, lots of ups and downs. Luca was entertaining as always in this one, less serious than in Bourne. I love the heroines! Gabi and Lia are kick butt kind of girls who won't get pushed around. These two novellas were more Lia's story than Gabi's. It was fun to see where Lia would take us. She's brave with a kind heart. If you love the River of Time series like I do, you have to read this last installment. It's just as wonderful as the earlier books.

9780312656270,"I'm struggling a bit in figuring out how to write my review for Hades (Halo #2) by Alexandra Adornetto. It's because I enjoyed reading Halo, but this time around I'm not quite sure if I do or not. I have mixed feelings. I would rate this book around 3.5 to 4 Spades. Hades is fast past but at times in certain parts of the story it drags on. I felt that there was too much describing of EVERYTHING. From the surroundings, background, actions, hair color, how the person looks and sometimes it's of the same person where then it gets very repetitive. I understand it helps to give descriptions of things to help the reader to visualize the setting, but it was just getting way too much where it became redundant. There were some certain errors like having a gas pedal on a motorcycle that kind of got me because I felt common sense/research wasn't applied. BUT I'm reading from the ARC and I'm hoping that the hiccup (mistake) gets fixed for final print. As for the ending, it was a disappointment. I was kind of upset. It was like someone tore the last page from the book. It was too abrupt that it didn't leave the reader any last thoughts; no bits of meat to piece for the up coming novel. Just a THE END; like a movie getting cut off in mid sentence. What I did like that made me give Hades a 4 Spades is that the story was really engaging as long as you ignore the tedious descriptions and bits of error (I'm not talking about punctuation). I couldn't help myself from staying up late paging through until I got to the end. There were exciting moments in the book that gave me reason to go on to the next chapter, and there is more action going on in Hades than there was in Halo. All in all it was okay.",SpadesHigh

9781442409095,"It is always bittersweet finishing a series. There is this feeling of depression that you won't be with the characters you've came to love, rooted for, and swooned over. There is also, at least for me, a feeling of accomplishment and closure (provided that the author delivers.) And Lauren definitely delivered in Sever. I got caught right back up into Rhine's world. Cecily is grown so much, and it was quite a journey in Sever to see her develop so much more. She is such a unique type of character, and I can't really describe how reading about her has effected me. She has some heartbreaking scenes in this one, and I didn't know how I would handle it. Linden is as sweet and generous as ever, if still blinded to what is around him, but luckily the women around him and Reed, his uncle who I adored by the way, help to make him see the world and his father the way it really is. I love Reed's inventive and curious nature, as well as appreciating him offering his house and protection. The conversations he had with Rhine were great, and I loved his teasing nature. I wasn't expecting him as a character, but he turned out to be great. Rhine's search for her brother, and figure out the truth or not about what he is saying. She wants to show Rowan that she is alive, and also get some of the answers that he seems to hold about her past, and hopefully the hope that they cling to for their future. I flew through this and did not want to put it down to eat or sleep, and did so only reluctantly. The characters are beautifully written and captivating. Rhine's emotions and motivations are easy to relate to. I still had a hard time with her pushing Linden away, but I knew that she had to find Gabriel. So, in essence for most of the book, you know until THAT thing happened, I was still torn over who she should be with,and who I would pick for myself. Linden is a hard one to choose though because of the sharing and sister wives deal. The ending floored me, it was things that I wasn't expecting, hoped against hope wouldn't happen, but there was also hope and good things that happened. I know that it is a good and fitting ending, but I am still kinda in shock over the events, and dealing with some loss. I can't believe that I have to say goodbye to these characters.

Annah has been waiting for her 'brother' Elias to return to the dark city for 3 years. He should have been back a year ago, and she's now giving up hope of him ever returning to her alive. Annah makes the decision to leave the city, but on her way out sees someone who gives her hope - her twin sister Abigail who she lost in the forest when they were only 5. (Who the reader knows as 'Gabry' from book 2). Annah tries to find her sister but instead runs into Catcher (also from book 2) who is immune to the infection that kills everyone else and turns them into the walking dead. Then the person who Annah wants to see more than any other turns up - Elias, the 'brother' who she thought was dead. But Annah worries that Elias is leading them into a trap; with hordes of undead descending on the city, Elias claims that the only way to stay safe is to turn Catcher over to the recruiters in return for shelter. But is the small community of recruiters really all that is left in the world? And can Annah really live with the barbaric things that are going on there? This book was a real post-apocalyptic, depressing, scary, horror show, misery-fest. I can honestly say that a times I was angry, sad, and shocked by the goings on. I really felt for Annah who seemed to be having a real bad time of things, and things were only made worse for her when it seemed that the people who she loved most in the world might not have her best interests at heart. The things that went on in the one main human safe house were terrible and sickening, and the story was really dark. The author really did create a desolate post-apocalyptic war zone that made you want to keep reading with a morbid curiosity for what atrocious deeds would come next. It was strange seeing Gabrielle from Annah's point of view, who assumed that Gabry had had an easy life, which we all know wasn't the case, and it was difficult to know what the hell Elias was thinking, who just seemed to have gone a bit nuts. Once again we had the obligatory love-triangle thingy, this time with Gabry and Elias, and Annah and Catcher, Annah and Elias, and obviously there's the history between Catcher and Gabry too. I wasn't sure where the author would go with this story after the first book, and it seems like she delved even further into our worst nightmares with this third book. Man do I hate zombies right now! Although at times the actions of the humans are far worse than those of the zombies. A dark, post-apocalyptic zombie story that will send you running for the hills. 7.5 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth

Antsy finds it difficult to even think about The Schwa without his mind wandering onto some other subject, no doubt due to ""The Schwa Effect."" Antsy may not have been the first the pass The Schwa by, but he is the first one to start putting his friend's power of blending in to good use. After a set of experiments to determine the strength of ""The Schwa Effect,"" Antsy and The Schwa form a collaboration that starts earning them money for dares and services (such as spying on the faculty lounge) that utilize The Schwa's untapped potential. When a bold dare to enter the apartment of a reclusive neighbor goes horribly wrong, Antsy and The Schwa find themselves at the mercy of Old Man Crawley, who puts them to work to make up for their intrusion. The boys' friendship is put to the test when Antsy is given a...much more desirable task, which sets The Schwa on a mission to prove his very existence to the world in the grandest, most unforgettable manner possible. I absolutely fell in love with this book, and that is not something I'd say lightly. Superior characterization, mainly the shifting position of narrator Antsy as both protagonist and antagonist to the title character, had me rooting for nearly every personality featured in this story.

9780448095219,"This is an excellent novel by <b>Mildred A. Wirt</b> in 1944, unrecognized as its author for years. Unless pertaining to computers or freedom, I disregard remarks about a story feeling outdated. It would be silly to expect literature or films to accommodate 2012 (and all the years my review gets read). A story is current when it's composed. People shouldn't penalize era of origin in feedback. A man in a declining mansion he can't afford, is raising his Granddaughter, <i>Susan</i>. Her Dad <i>Philip March</i>, a deceased soldier and composer, identified hidden sheet music for his late wife in coded letters. Publishing the songs would bring money <i>Susan</i> and her Grandpa desperately need but some were located and stolen. This sub-plot is weak because one cannot pose as a musician and bring music notes to a radio station, airing a finished product in a week! That's my sole critique: suggesting sheet music is an instant commodity, as accessible and valuable as stealing a key or social insurance number. However if we take the rest as is, this is a compelling mystery. <i>Nancy</i> cons a disliked peer, sneaks into a high security factory, and works on codes. I am always excited by secret compartments and rooms. They are ample here, to heart's content! <i>Nancy's</i> Dad, who is a lawyer, has tremendous respect for her by utilizing her investigative talents on difficult cases. It was also extremely brave for a 20 year-old to glean information from a family she dislikes and to sneak into a rival laboratory after hours. Like <i>""Harry Potter""</i>, don't be dissuaded by the target demographic. I maintain that the most enthralling, suspense-raising mysteries, are those that involve anything except 'a dead body'! Most fiction siphons their plots from a murder. Secrets and clues are far more original and gripping!",C. Riedel

9780738709611,"All Amy Nelson wanted was to have a regular summer. To spend time with her best friend, Jessica, and her new boyfriend. But that won't happen for Amy by a long shot. It seems that her estranged father wants her to go back to Israel with him to visit her grandmother. Sure, going to Israel may seem exciting to most people, but not for Amy. Not when there are wars going on and the fact that she has to go with a man that she hardly knows. The one good thing that may come from this is the coolest fashions that her best friend is always telling her about. Before she knows it, Amy's mother makes her go and she's on the next plane to Israel. Things couldn't get any worse for Amy at this point; well, actually they can. When she arrives, Amy sees something totally different then what she would see at home in Chicago. There seems to be soldiers and guards at every corner. Not only that, but Amy just discovered that she isn't sleeping in a fancy hotel, but more like an old house, with one bathroom and seven other people that she's never met. Then there's her cousin Snotty, I mean Osnat, who seems to hate Amy the moment she sees her, and the no-shirt cute-jerk, Avi, who Amy happens to see everywhere she turns. If only she could just get him out of her mind. There's also her aba, or grandmother, that for someone she hardly knows, Amy discovers there's a deep connection between the two of them. With an entirely new family and obnoxious people in a totally different country, it seems like this might be the craziest summer yet for Amy. HOW TO RUIN A SUMMER VACATION, no doubt, was the greatest book I've read in a long time. Not only does the basis of the book pull you in, but the cast of characters all charm their way into your heart. Even though Amy may be a little bratty at times, every obstacle she goes through and every awkward situation for her makes reading the book worthwhile. Simone Elkeles eliminates all the myths we had about Israel and introduces a completely new culture that I, for one, hardly knew anything about. Not only will you begin to appreciate Amy's new culture, but you'll also think about your own culture and how unique it is. The sequel to this book, HOW TO RUIN MY TEENAGE LIFE, will release on June 1, 2007.",TeensReadToo
9780440237778,"The third and final book in Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle trilogy, THE SWEET FAR THING picks up a few months after REBEL ANGELS ended. It's now spring, and Gemma has been unable to reenter the realms with or without her friends since the Christmas holidays, when she sealed all the magic inside herself. She has grown uneasy with dreams of the supposedly dead Circe and the absence of Kartrik, despite his pledge to support her. As Mrs. Nightwing oversees the rebuilding of Spence Academy's long destroyed East Wing, Gemma discovers a door that leads into the realms. Soon she, Felicity, and Ann have rejoined Pippa in the realms. All is far from well, however. Within the realms, the various tribes strive to convince Gemma to share her magic, and she finds herself unable to trust any of them. Circe is not dead after all, and her warnings frighten Gemma. And what of the new visions, in which Gemma sees a former student of Spence Academy, who writes of the Tree of All Souls? Outside the realms, there is just as much uncertainty. Gemma prepares for her debut and tries to make her peace with her father and brother. Felicity's headstrong behavior has put her on the verge of losing her inheritance and freedom. Ann must decide whether to risk everything on the chance of a career in the theatre. As dark forces spread through the realms and the girls' debuts approach, Gemma must find more strength in herself than she ever thought possible, and decide just what kind of woman she wants to be -- for herself, not anyone else. Fans of the trilogy will tear through this book, eager to reach its conclusion and learn the fates of all its characters. Bray's descriptions of Victorian life and the mysterious realms are as colorful as ever. Gemma makes a sympathetic if sometimes frustrating narrator, believable in her struggle to make the right decision. At over 800 pages, THE SWEET FAR THING is far longer than either of the books before it, and there is some repetition to the earlier scenes, but those who love the world will be happy to spend as much time there as they can. Toward the end, the plot picks up to a heart-pounding pace. Between cheering the happier parts of the ending, and grieving over its inevitable sadness, readers will be glad to have lived through this tale with Gemma and her friends.",TeensReadToo
9781447206828,"'Wow' is the only word I can think of to describe this book. Alyson Noel has done it yet again! The second book in the series doesn't fail to impress - it is a stunning story line that can capture anyone's attention. By reading the blurb of the book and the line '...but first she must make an unthinkable sacrifice,' that had me engaged straight away and I had no doubt that whatever this sacrifice was, it was going to be one to remember, and I was right. Throughout the book we begin to read about Daire growing as a person into whom she is suppose to be, the Seeker. At the end she shows courage and strength which I really admired in her. But also Dace grows and we read from his point of view, which I feel is effective in revealing him as a person by his thoughts, weaknesses and strengths. When reading this book you'll notice there is talk about snow, and with it being on the cover of the book it soon becomes clear that it is important to the story. Without revealing too much I'll just say that it becomes iconic and plays a big part in the story. However the only thing I feel that could have been included is that the character Cade could have been involved a bit more because I feel that I haven't really got to know him that well, only through what we read from the other characters. So personally I think it would be effective in looking at things from his point of view to understand him better. Overall I can not criticize this book at all, has everything you'd want, the ending itself I absolutely loved - it blew me away! Very much looking forward to Mystic!",Maria
9780373210589,"I read and reviewed this book on my book blog on February 11. Gore: Yes Magic: Yes Romance: Yes Action: 4.5 stars Pacing: 3 stars Plot: 4 stars Cover: 4 stars Alice in Zombieland isn't exactly Alice in Wonderland with zombioes, in fact, it's pretty different from the story Alice in Wonderland, although there were some things that had to do with it, like the rabbit shaped cloud, the protagonists' name is Alice, etc. But mostly, it's a unique story with kind of a misleading name (I'll explain later). I enjoyed reading this book. I liked Alice, she's tough, feisty, pretty good at fighting, and has a great sense of humour. She also dosen't drink (which is rare for YA main characters, in real life not all teenagers drink, I never did). I also like the fact that unlike in every other YA novels, the main character doesn't have a driver's license. It feels like authors think that every teenager gets a license at the age of 16, but that's not true, I didn't get my G2 until later. Plus, I never understood how people can get a full license at 16 years old, unless the law for driving is different in the USA, because here in Ontario, we can get a G1 license (learner's permit) at 16, and a year later, a G2 license if we pass the road test, then a year later a full license, G, if we pass the highway test. Alice did annoy me with her immediate obsession with Cole, it was her first day at the school and she already can't stop staring and thinking about a guy she never even talked to, that's just ridiculous, it's basically love at first sight, and since I don't believe in that, it always angers me whenever I see it in books, tv shows, and movies. I know that later on, they do try to get to know each other, but the immediate infatuation with each other is creepy and so unrealistic. Then we have the group of zombie slayers, who are mostly guys,e except for Mackenzie and Trina, and later on Alice of course. But I feel the only boys that we actually learned stuff about and the ones that actually seemed important are: Cole (obviously), Frosty, and Bronx. The others seemed like they were just there. At this point, I've read so many books with bad boys in them that I'm starting to get bored with some of them, believe it or not. I think it's because I read the Lux series and love Daemon Black so much. No fictional bad boy can ever be better than him, at least in my opinion, but then again, you never know, it could happened, we'll see. Also, I'm not a big fan of the romance, mostly because Alice got so needy around him, it's hard to explain what I mean without spoilers. Although, the banter between the two is really funny sometimes. These days, I'm trying to look for something new in the love interest, for ex: Ussi from Maid Sama by Hiro Fujiwara, the girl annoys me so far, but Usui (Misaki's love interest) is awesome, he's different, he's not exactly the bad boy, but he's not a total nice guy either. I like characters that are funny, ever since I was little, which is why I loved and still love the Warner Brothers and Hanna Barbera cartoons so much. Also, one of the reasons why I'm on Team Puck from The Iron Fey series, I'm a sucker for the funny and mischeivious guy. And of course, how could I possibly leave Kat out of this review, she's my most favourite character from this book. She's spunky, feisty, isn't afraid to speak her mind, a good friend, good at cheering people up, and just fun to be around.So what if she likes to talk a lot and has a big ego, she's still caring and an awesome best friend to have. It's funny how her and Ali became friends, they are definitely fast friends, but I don't mind that this time. I wish I had a bff like Kat. The zombies are not your average zombies. These zombies are like ghosts, they exist in the spirit world and the only way to fight and kill them is to become a spirit yourself, which, the slayers know how to do. I was never a big fan of the traditional zombies, (which is probably because I've never read any good zombie books before this) but I loved these kinds of zombies, it's very creative. Although, who these zombies can hurt, hasn't exactly been made clear, or maybe I just didn't understand. The zombies aren't the only bad guys, the real evil ones are the Hazmats, as Ali likes to call them. They are people like the slayers, who can see ghosts and zombies, but unlike the slayers, they don't want to destroy the zombies, they want to experiment on them. It hasn't been made clear as to what their planning, what they're hoping to achieve by doing what they're doing. This opens up many possibilities of what could happened in the sequel, I can't wait! Overall, I enjoyed this book. I kept flipping page after page, eager to know what happened next. This book definitely kept me reading. Alice in Zombieland is entertaining, has good writing and flows nicely, has witty characters, is really funny, unique, and is an enjoyable read that'll keep you up long after the sun sets. I rated this book: 4.5 stars. Read more reviews on my book blog: nazishreads.net",Nazish Ahmed

9780312608668,"Beatrice Shakespeare Smith lives in a theater. She's not an actress, but she knows every part. The Theatre Illuminata is the only home Bertie has ever know. But one mishap too many has the Theater Director determined to send Bertie on her way -unless she can prove that she is a valuable part of the Theater. Now, Bertie must fight for her home while unlocking the secrets of her past... Ok, I'll try to control my gushing and fan-girliness over this book, but EYES LIKE STARS is amazing!!! This has to be one of the most creative, imaginative, beautiful novels I have read. I loved the setting of the Theatre Illuminata and the idea that all the players of every play lived in the theater and were able to be called upon whenever they are needed (and sometimes when they're not needed!). Lisa Mantchev has managed to capture the magic of the theater in this stunningly written novel. I honestly can't believe this is her debut. All the characters are so richly drawn and detailed and I could hear various voices for everyone as I was reading. Everything was so vividly written, I could actually see the see the story unfolding as a play in front of me. The fairies offer fun comic relief, whereas the tension between Ariel and Bertie provides plenty of drama. The dialog is witty and snappy and lots of fun. This was a book that I literally had to tear myself away from and force myself to go to work and sleep - I never wanted to stop reading. Shakespeare does play heavily into the novel, but you don't need to be a Shakespearean scholar to follow along and recognize the characters. Also, Lisa Mantchev does an excellent job filling the reader in on the important details of each part, without it losing the flow of the story. There are several plays and characters that make appearances throughout and discovering each one is part of the joy of reading this novel. As someone who has been heavily involved in theater, I loved the subtle details about theater life that only theater people really and truly understand - the arguments over props vs. sets, the actor's egos. But even if you've never had any experience in a theater, there is sure to be something you'll love in EYES LIKE STARS. I highly recommend this to all readers, even readers who typically shy away from fantasy. This didn't feel like a typical fantasy to me, so I'm sure it will attract even those who don't usually read that genre. I'm excited to see this will be a trilogy - I'm looking forward to reading more from this fabulous debut author! *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781408314814,"I admit it. When I first picked this book up I was expecting it to be another Twilight rip off (which I liked back in the day) but I was thinking it wouldn't be very good. Much to my surprise it was excellent! I've noticed over the last few years or so that there has been a wonderful influx of Australian authors that are taking the lead in the market for their novels especially young adult authors and it seems as those this author is no exception. She's great! I really enjoyed this virst book in the Violet Eden series. I thought that the main character Eden was very refreshing. She wasn't a push over like a lot of the other teenage girl heroines are in other novels. She had backbone, and a kick ass atittude though she did have a couple bouts of whining but whatever she's a teenager it just made her more ""real"" because she wasn't written with over the top reactions at all. Hallelujah! I thought the whole Grigori thing was really interesting the fact that on her 16th birthday Violet finds out that she's not exactly entirely human. In fact she is half angel and half human making her part of the society of Grigori just like her love interest Lincoln who is her partner. Unfortunately, Violet doesn't react to the wole situation as well as Lincoln would have liked and she ends up with Phoenix who needless to say is not on friendly terms with any of the Grigori except the undecided Violet. Basically there's a whole love triangle thing going on that results in Lincoln getting hurt and Phoenix and Violet getting freaking on a mountain hourse before Violet jumps off the side of a mountain to ""Embrace"" he Grigori side. So yeah I suppose that in some ways this book was similar to Twilight because there are some recognizable themes and situations. However, I must say that this book is very much it's own novel. There was a lot of action in the novel to balance out the whole romance element so at least there was an equilibrium which was very much needed. I also liked that the characters acted their ages and the dialogue flowed naturally. There was no awkwardness to it and that's something I think everyone can appreciate because not much kills a book more than horrible written dialogue. In the end I thought that Embrace was a compelling read. I think I finished it in 2 nights or something like that and I'm really excited to read the second book in the series Entice. Since the last book finished I've been really curious to see how the next plays out because I'm really interested to see how things play out with the whole love triangle/Grigori situations play out. I would recommend this book to anyone who love urban fantasy young adult novels that have a new and refreshing spin to the whole Angels mythos. It's really well written and I think it's a treat for anyone who is the fan of the genre.",Kimberly Roy
9780062081933,"The cover: Just like the previous books in the series, this cover features a liar (in this case that?C/??s Aria) along with the title of the book in a unique font. I?C/??m just starting to wonder if all the books which have Aria on the cover have something in common?C/??| The storyline: I started this book back in March, and stopped at 40% because of my dear finals, so I read 60% this afternoon, and I loved it! I?C/??m so glad I left it for now, this book has a summer and vacation feeling to it. The summary: The girls are finally on vacation and going on a cruise. They?C/??re trying to get passed what they did back in Jamaica and all the A-drama, but good luck with that with A right on board. Aria is enjoying the vacation with Noel, becomes a friend with someone who she may need to stay away from. Emily is still burdened by the secret she hasn?C/??t told her friends about yet and her family is not talking to her and they don?C/??t even look her in the eye. A new and unwelcomed guest on the cruise takes her thoughts and heart. She?C/??s so happy and can?C/??t believe she?C/??s lucky to be happy after all what they?C/??ve done. But maybe she?C/??s right, it?C/??s too good to be true. After getting over all this boy drama we?C/??ve been through in the previous book, Hanna is finally relaxing with Mike and hoping to get her tanning right this time. She also makes a new awkward friend, whom she thinks can?C/??t be trusted, probably because they know about an accident she was involved in sometime ago. Will A be able to get them after all?! That?C/??s what we all want to know! What I loved: - Okay, so this book is full of suspense and thriller. I?C/??ve been holding my breath every time I sense something is going wrong. I just couldn?C/??t help but suspect everyone on the cruise. Everyone was acting weird and off balance. - The story is well built and way better than the previous book. It?C/??s so intense and you expect A to jump at the liars every 5sec! - The writing as usual is just smooth and really good. - For some reason, the liars have matured a lot and they?C/??re better at dealing with stuff, especially Aria, I liked her a lot in this book. - Oh God the last few chapters! They were so tense. I had all types of emotions trying to finish them. They were great. What I disliked: - Mainly one thing: why does the author keep making the liars so stupid? It?C/??s way obvious from the beginning that A is setting them up just like the previous book. It was so tiring reading many chapters just wishing they could have avoided all this trouble just if ?C/??they?C/??d learned anything?C/?? from what happened before. The characters: I can?C/??t talk about most of the characters because I?C/??ll spoil the story. Aria is my favorite in this book. She?C/??s so mature, calm, friendly and just the best in the group. Emily is the emotional one, she?C/??s always comforting and taking care of others ignoring her own problems. Spencer is over thinking stuff which only helps A in his/her plan. But she?C/??s way better than before, she?C/??s mostly scared A will sabotage her new relationship to get to her. Hanna is enjoying the cruise and throughout the story she stays out of trouble and tries to enjoy a vacation without A coming across her mind every second. Favorite quotes: Ever told a lie to save yourself? Maybe you blamed the dent in your parents?C/?? Mercedes on your brother so you could still go to the spring formal. Maybe you told your Algebra teacher you weren?C/??t part o?C/??| --- Hit and Run. Clownfish are pretty, Starfish are pale. Will Aria?C/??s boyfriend Visit her in jail? ?C/??A --- Chapter 19: Dead Man?C/??s Float. Emily: I?C/??m okay. Not going to where we planned, but somewhere even better. We?C/??ll find each other someday?C/??that?C/??s a promise. --- Chapter 33: Emily Gets Her Wishes. Conclusion: This is, yet again, one of my favorite reads this year. I?C/??m so excited to be coming closer to the end of this series and yet I?C/??m so sad it?C/??s going to end (in next December! *_*).",Randa Kerbache

9780316077057,"When I tried to formulate my review for this book I was torn, and I kind of still am. I'm a big fan of Garcia and Stohl's writing and enjoyed the first installment in the Caster Chronicles series, Beautiful Creatures, but I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it's sequel. There were some elements that I loved and some that I didn't enjoy much at all. Let me try to make some sense of my ramblings. To start off, I can say that while I found Beautiful Creatures to be slow in some parts, that was not the case with Beautiful Darkness. We did get more background and of course some histories and mysteries were cleared up, but at the same time the plot wasn't slowed down because of this. Ethan is back as our narrator and this time around he really (for me at least) became a stronger character. If anyone thought he and Lena's troubles/obstacles were over, they were wrong. In fact, their previous problems were nothing in comparison in my opinion. Garcia and Stohl upped the anti (so to speak) in this one and that aspect won me over and kept me reading. Ethan's personality came out more and I think readers will get the chance to see him as an individual as far as his feelings go and will only grow to love him even more. Now for what I wasn't really loving about this book. We meet some new characters in Beautiful Darkness and they didn't really win me over like I expected them to. Garcia and Stohl gave us such an all star cast in Beautiful Creatures, maybe in my mind they just didn't stand a chance of measuring up, I don't know? But some of the original characters upset and disappointed me too. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone so I can't be specific, but when this book hits the shelves and readers get their hands on it, I don't think I'll be the only one feeling this way. But to end on a good note, I did like the wrap-up Garcia and Stohl wove together in the end. All I will say is that the Caster Chronicles series can only get more interesting and I'm extremely curious to see what happens next. Cliffhangers vs. neatly tied up endings, which do I prefer? I'm not really sure, but what I do know is that I'm still a fan of Garcia and Stohl's writing and I'm looking forward to reading what the Caster Chronicles will bring us next.",Katelyn

This is the life and times of nearly sixteen-year old Ruby Oliver, former girlfriend of Jackson, former best friend of Kim, former semi-popular Sophomore high-school girl. Now just a girl with panic attacks, a Xerox-copied ""Boyfriend List"" circulating through school, and a shrink named Doctor Z. Ruby's life used to be pretty normal, until her boyfriend broke up with her to date her best friend.

Because of this, Gwen is facing the fallout that this has had on Mythos Academy and is arrested by the Protectorate. Gwen is put on trial and is quarantined to the school until she is either found guilty or not guilty. This makes it a little difficult to prove her innocence but with her faithful allies including her love interest Logan, maybe she stands of chance. The biggest obstacle in their relationship this time around is that Logan's dad is the leader of the Protectorate and is NOT a fan of Gwen and her gypsy heritage. He also truly believes that she is not Nike's Champion. Gwen starts to fear that the Protectorate has been infiltrated and is not so sure she has a chance at a fair trial. Just another great addition to an already amazing adventure. Gwen and Logan of course seem to always have something that gets in the way of the growing relationship (getting arrested on your first date can put a damper on things). I liked how this time we got to learn a little more about Logan so if you are a super fan of Logan, this one is for you! Another great aspect is we are seeing more of the world that Estep has created. The Protectorate is first introduced and we witness the inner workings of their so called ""judicial system."" There is also the characters that we have grown to love such as Metis, Nickamedes and Gwen's grandmother and a few new ones, including my new favorite, Alexei. Estep as always, throws the twists and turns that as a faithful reader, have come to love.

Gwen Frost attended regular high school until her mother died and she was thrown into the magical world that is Mythos Academy. Isolated at first, she soon makes friends with Daphne, Carson, Oliver and Logan. At the beginning of this book, Gwen is on her first official date with Logan, the hot spartan, when the Protectorate enter the coffee shop and she's arrested for freeing Loki from prison. For some reason, I found myself not enjoying Gwen's character in this book, and even Logan's presence couldn't seem to ignite this for me. Disappointly, having enjoyed the first three books in the series immensely, I was bored and had to force myself to continue. We meet Logan's dad Linus, who is head of the Protectorate and Gwen's main accuser. He seems dead set on taking Gwen from Logan's life and won't listen to reason. He makes no secret of the fact that he isn't happy with Logan's choice of girlfriend. Another new character, Alexei, is assigned to be Gwen's guard while she's awaiting trial. He takes his position very seriously, shadowing Gwen but not interacting with her at all, so we get to see very little of his personality, but from the little we do see at the end of the book, I think he'll be an enjoyable character in the future and I look forward to getting to know him better in the next book, Midnight Frost. My main solace in this book came from the mystery of the reaper in the midst of the Protectorate. Other than this suspense keeping me going, I'm not sure I would have found it in me to continue. I didn't find Gwen to be the brightest spark and in this one, and the last book, Dark Frost, I felt she did some stupid things. While I can't dis her bravery or how much she cares for her friends, she's starting to wear on me. While this has been my least favourite of the Mythos books, the ending did provide some light at the end of the tunnel so I will still be picking up the next book in this series.",Suzanne Finnegan
9780062267177,"I enjoyed the continuation of this story and thought that it was given the ending it deserved. However, I don't believe it was as good as the previous two books in the trilogy. All the drama was centred around Lucy's need for independence from Jude and she became a little to whiny because of it, even though Jude is very patient and supportive of her. Thankfully her attitude improves as the story progresses. All the characters are very likeable, especially Jude, the bad boy who turned has turned his life around completely from heading towards gaol, to instead becoming an NFL star. He is very caring and protective of Lucy and only wants a great future for the pair of them. Lucy is once again sharp-tongued and stands up for what she believes in even against Jude. However we finally get to see a softer side to her thanks to a new friends providing her with some sound advice. Crush, I thought, fell flat on emotion and was predictable. That's where this book loses points for me. If you have read Crash and Clash then this is a must read if you enjoyed those. If you have not read those, you will find this story hard to understand without knowing the background story of Lucy and Jude.",Sharon Xuereb
9781416953487,"I have been a fan of Sharon M. Draper for some time. She is a master at writing realistic fiction. COPPER SUN is her first historical fiction and it is amazing -- as well as frighteningly authentic. This book follows the trials and tribulations of Amari, a fifteen-year-old African maiden. After witnessing the slaughter of both the old and young in her African village, including her parents and her young brother, she is chained, by feet, hands, and neck, lined up, and herded miles on foot to the ocean by pale skinned visitors with fire sticks. She watches her fellow Africans suffer incomprehensible humiliation and death at the hands of their captors as they are shipped like animal cargo across the ocean. The life that awaits her is nothing like she could have ever imagined. Amari must adapt to life as a purchased slave on a rice plantation, a life that includes atrocities committed upon her by her white owners. She meets Polly, an indentured servant who has dreams of making it to the big house and being a fine lady of standing. Instead, Polly lives in the slave quarters and finds she's given the chore of civilizing Amari, now called Myna, and teaching her enough English to work. After witnessing murder, the two girls find themselves thrown together in a desperate run for freedom. This is not just another book about slavery. This is a book about something real and tangible. Ms. Draper's writing is so vivid that you can smell the rank odors beneath ship. You can feel the pain of being lashed with a whip. Your throat will constrict at the heart-wrenching pain of a mother and child being forced apart. You will also celebrate the strength and spirit of Amari and those she inspires. COPPER SUN won the Coretta Scott King Award. This is a book I will make sure goes on my classroom shelves. *Gold Star Award Winner!",TeensReadToo
9781599903736,"Jack has long been a trickster - he's just not had the best of luck. When a heist involving magic beans, a beanstalk, and giants goes wrong, Jack leaves town. After his adventures with Rapunzel (in RAPUNZEL'S REVENGE), Jack returns home to Shyport only to discover that the giant, Blunderboar, is in charge, the city is in ruins thanks to an infestation of ant people, and his mother is being held captive and is in charge of baking bones into bread. It's up to Jack and Rapunzel to save the day! I'm often asked to give booktalks on great books for tweens and I always inlcude the Hale's first graphic novel outing, RAPUNZEL'S REVENGE (and now CALAMITY JACK!). These two books are a librarian's dream come true! The Hales combine witty dialogue, action and adventure, beautifully detailed artwork, and lots of humor to create the perfect graphic novel. I would give this one to anyone who is not convinced in the value of graphic novels or anyone who's a newbie to the style. (And of course old fans, too!) The fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is given the steampunk treatment in CALAMITY JACK, and those looking for a great adventure read will devour this one. There's even a cute bit of romance thrown in, so I think this book will have wide appeal. It is a sequel to RAPUNZEL'S REVENGE, but readers don't necessarily have to read the first one to pick this one up. The book starts with Jack's past and gives us a little information on how Jack and Rapunzel met, so I doubt readers will feel lost. As I mentioned, the dialogue is very witty - there were a few lines I just had to read aloud to my husband because they were too great to keep to myself. The artwork is very detailed - young Jack is pictured with his tongue out while thinking and we get a glimpse that he hasn't lost this habit as an adult. It's this attention to detail that make the art stand out. The text and illustrations pair perfectly and work together, which makes this an excellent example of a graphic novel. (And be sure to check out the inside cover page for a peek at our authors and illustrator snuck into the artwork.) This is a book to share, to pass around to friends, and re-read, because each time you'll see something new. I'm hoping we can look forward to more graphic novels from this creative team - I'd love to see their take on other fairy tales.",TeensReadToo

9780385735957,"To me, the main criteria for a good book is a cast of great characters, and this book definitely has that. Hattie is a very mature 16-year-old. She is an orphan who has been raised by first one relative and then another, and now she finds that she has inherited a homestead from an uncle that she never really knew. Her best friend has just joined the army to go fight the Kaiser in Germany at the outbreak of World War I. Hattie boards a train with her cat, Mr. Whiskers, to claim her new home in Montana. When she arrives, she discovers that she will be required to finish ""proving up"" on the homestead...build an enormous amount of fence, and plant eighty of the three-hundred-and-twenty acres in wheat and flax, and she only has eight months left to accomplish this. The house is a one-room cabin that is barely habitable, and winter has Montana in its grip. Her livestock consists of a very congenial horse, and a contentious cow. Hattie is a very resourceful girl, but life is difficult. Most of her new neighbors become fast friends, but some desperately want to claim her land for their own. Her dear friends, the Mullers, suffer bad treatment because of their German heritage and the War. This is a fast-paced story of adventure with friendship, heartbreak, and joy. The believable characters will remain with you long after you have read the book, and the handsome villain isn't all bad. The suspense in this very entertaining book builds to a surprising climax that I didn't anticipate. Larson adds a couple of interesting-looking recipes in the back of the book that I'm anxious to try out, along with a bibliography of other great reading about the American West and homesteading.",TeensReadToo
9780062198518,"Lynn and her mother live in a house by a pond where their entire existence is to defend it. Water is scarce in the world and the more you have access to water, the more people will take it by force. Lynn grew up defending their little pond and thinks nothing of it until some strangers change her viewpoint and realizes that there are good people out there too. This reality is so downright realistic, it's scary. Not to mention a growing virus called Chlorea that kills everyone in its path. I couldn't but think of such a harsh and brutal world. This was Lynn's world and even though she was a country girl and knew how to live out in the wild, she managed to struggle and keep on surviving the most harshest realities. Death, sickness, loneliness, she managed to stay strong and I deeply admire her character. She's not like any character I've read about before and that says a lot. Her strength is clearly evident by the turning point in the book. I loved her attitude and her willingness to help and grow. Even the secondary characters like Lucy and Shebbs were wonderful additions. They showed her how to be a family, to be able to laugh and cry. I loved the snowball fight acne. It screamed innocence in such a horrible reality. Pacing was a little slow in the beginning but it started to pick up afterwards. I liked how the entire world wasn't explained in one huge chapter but bit by bit from several characters. The story is mostly about surviving and what needs to be done to achieve that. Not a Drop to Drink is a wonderful addition to the apocalyptic genre where the harshest realities are mixed with the question to be morally right.",Giselle SM
9780316068673,"Ok, so this book was really quite good to me. The writer has a way of catching you from the beginning and pulling you in and on a ride. Right from the very beginning I was intrigued by the characters and their story and felt horribly bad for the two sisters, Scarlett and Rosie. But, as the story progressed I had some problems with the story, and I will explain. First of all, I had problems grasping onto to the name of the werewolves she used. ""Fenris"", and I assume that the only reason that I had a hard time with it is because I have never read the name or heard of the name before this book. So I grasped the change in name. I'm always good with change. Second, as much as I loved the sisters connection after losing their grandmother at such a young age and Scarlett's revenge driven angst and Rosie's need to branch out from hunting, I did not like how overly protective and selfish Scarlett had gotten with her sister and her happiness. Always thinking they way she did towards her (Rosie's) happiness and how angry she was with Silas drove me completely insane. And once you read it, you will know why. Lastly, the story was predictable from about halfway through the book on. But the story also had good points and I will touch on those as well, because not everyone likes to hear how bad a story may be. As I have said, the sisters share a special bond with one another. They feel as if they are twins that were born in two totally different years and share the same heart. Rosie has a passion to be free while Scarlett has a passion to hunt Fenris, the ones that scarred her from an early age. Rosie has a hard time knowing what she wants until Silas comes back into their lives and changes everything. She starts viewing the world differently. That is why I like Rosie so much. She is able to see the beauty in things and know that there is life outside of hunting. Scarlett has a strong passion for hunting. Lives, breathes and longs for hunting. She is very determined and strong willed, which I also like that about her. I gave this book 3.5 stars because of the things that I didn't like about it, not because of the writer. The writer is a brilliant woman and knows how to write a story quite well. I do recommend this book to anyone 15 years or older. http://www.bookdepository.com/?a_aid=jumintboo-20",Erin Nation
9781409538585,"Mockingbird is a moving novel by Kathy Erskine in which she tries to send a very important message 'in hopes that we may all understand each other better'. This book was written after the Virginia Tech school shootings, which is of course a very emotive subject. Erskine handled the portrayal of the aftermath of this well. I was drawn it from the very first page of Mockingbird by the unique writing style and distinct voice of our eleven year old narrator, Caitlin, who has Aspergers. We are thrown into the highly emotional setting from the start when we discover that Caitlin's brother, Devon, was a victim of a school shooting. The whole story is about 'Getting It' (finding understanding), finding closure and acceptance. It is really interesting to see the world from Caitlin's perspective. She has quite basic language but the thought behind her words makes them very intense. For the most part, her actions make her appear younger than her age, but her thoughts could be seen as complex. There is some light humour throughout the book even though the protagonist isn't intentionally, or aware that she is, amusing - this just makes the story all that more poignant. Caitlin is often very literal in her thoughts and speech and this shows how things are interpreted differently by different people. Even though Caitlin was different, it's easy to empathise with her. Reading about Caitlin trying to make friends with others and her relationships in general were intriguing and her search to be able to empathise with other was touching. I found reading about her relationship with Michael, a younger boy whose mother was killed during the shooting, to be emotive and very intense but also very natural. Both Michael and Caitlin are young and their childishness, juxtaposed by the harsh issue of death and loss was very effective. I also found the difficult relationship between Caitlin and Josh, a brother of the shooter, to be very stirring. There was more miscommunication when people were calling him 'evil' for simply being related to the shooter. I found one scene in particular, in which Mr Mason, a teacher, makes an offensive remark about autistic children to be quite crushing, I really felt emotion on behalf of Caitlin. Her relationship with her counsellor and future art teacher, however, were fantastic. The title, Mockingbird, is a direct reference to Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. When Devon was still alive, he used to call Caitlin Scout as when she says something, it makes people think. The parallels between the Caitlin and Scout's family were well linked. A lot of this story revolves around Caitlin and her father working together to complete building a chest for Devon's Eagle-Scout project, in an attempt to give them both closure. This is a very sentimental idea and it is heartwarming to read about. The relationship between Caitlin and her father is poignant and impressive and when the chest is completed, there was quite an overwhelming feeling. The ending of this book was pleasant, but of course it wasn't perfect - it shouldn't and possibly couldn't be perfect. Not everyone is best friends or happy, but there is certainly room left for this to be a possibility. There's a good conclusion which leaves the story able to naturally progress. Despite everything that happened, the community spirit is still there. This was a fantastic and sometimes heart wrenching book that I would certainly recommend and I really anticipate reading more of Erskine's work.",Stephanie Forster (Stepping out of the Page)
9781442403390,"Also reviewed on my blog, the Vintage Bookworm. (http://www.vintagebookworm.blogspot.com Wow. I think I may have actually liked Red Glove more than it's predecessor, White Cat. I can't really choose. I loved them both, but there was just something about Red Glove. Hmm. These two books have everything; a great storyline, magic, romance, mystery, and the mafia! Holly Black is bloody brilliant! I've been trying and trying and trying to talk my husband into reading White Cat, but I guess he's still mad about how I got him to read the Twilight series and he really liked it, but Breaking Dawn killed it. He IS reading the Vampire Diaries series right now (Score!), but that's only because I got him hooked on the show. But anyway, back to Red Glove, ha ha! This series is awesome. I love Cassel! He is a great character. All the characters in here are pretty cool, even the mobsters! Ha! They are all really developed, along with the amazing world they are in. I mean, who wouldn't want to be a curseworker? I mean, I know there are some drawbacks, but isn't there always drawbacks to awesome things like this? Overall, I'm not really sure what else to say about this book other than it is completely awesome and I love this series and can't wait for the next book. I didn't really have any complaints that I can remember other than the fact it freaking ended and I don't have the next book! If you haven't read the first book in the series, do it now! This is an awesome series and definitely among my favorites. It's definitely a fresh storyline. VERY unique! The cover is awesome! Just like the first book's cover. Though I think I definitely like White Cat's cover better. Love the covers in this series.",Amanda
9781442403390,"I did not read White Cat, the first in the series, and, although this novel stands pretty well on it's own, it would definitely be made better by reading the first book. There are many references to events that happened previously that aren't fully clear without the background of the first. We meet Cassel Sharpe, a ""worker"", which seems to be a group of people who have special powers available to them with the touch of their hands, so everyone must wear gloves. A lot of workers run con games (including Cassel and his family, including his mother), others work for organized crime, and others try to stay under the radar to keep their ability from being known, as workers are generally regarded with fear and contempt. Cassel goes to Wallington, a private high school. The girl that he loves, Lila Zacharov, the daughter of a crime boss, also goes to the same school (although there appears to have been a period of years where she was caged as a cat, but that was never fully explained in this book). Cassel's mother ""worked"" Lila to fall in love with Cassel, so now Cassel can't allow himself to have a relationship with her, because he thinks her feelings for him are a result of his mother's machinations. Cassel is the rarest kind of worker, a transformation worker (he can change people to objects), and his talents have been abused by his family, and have also made Zacharov want him to join his crime family. The Feds are also after Cassel, although they aren't aware of his talents; they just want him to become an informant for them. With murder, a thwarted love, suspicion, and a fight against mandatory testing to find out if someone is a worker, there is a lot going on in this novel, and it was an interesting read. I was, however, somewhat lost here and there with not having read the first book in the series, which takes points off for me. If you've read White Cat, however, you won't have those problems, and will probably really like this one. QUOTE: There is technically nothing illegal about bare hands.

9780061232947,"Princess Mia is back in the final installment in the PRINCESS DIARIES series. Mia is ending her senior year and life couldn't be more stressful! Where will Mia go to college? Is her boyfriend, J.P., the one? Will Michael ever return from Japan? And will Mia survive turning eighteen? What's a princess to do? I have enjoyed the PRINCESS DIARIES series ever since I read the first book and always enjoy escaping into Mia's world. I think what I love most about the series is that Mia's voice is always fresh and funny and makes me giggle with girly happiness. Even though Mia is a princess, she's still a teenager and a geek at heart (which this fellow geek at heart loves). Author Meg Cabot is the queen of teen chick lit and she always captures the perfect voice of teens in her novels. Mia is relatable to teens, but also to older readers looking back on their own teen years. Coming in at 400 pages, FOREVER PRINCESS is the longest of the PRINCESS DIARIES books and fans are in for a treat. FOREVER PRINCESS is wonderfully funny and charming. Mia has come a long way from her freshman year, and readers who have been following the series will see that Mia, as well as the rest of her friends, have grown up along the way. But just because Mia and the gang are seniors doesn't mean their crazy adventures are far from over, and Mia again finds herself in over her head. Meg Cabot delivers a winner that I'm sure fans old and new will fall in love with. I have to admit that as much as I enjoyed this book, I was sad when I finished and I really hope that Meg Cabot will write about Mia's adventures after high school in the future.

9780857078070,"www.booksforcompany.com In Short - Unspoken has a great concept behind it with a unique storyline. - Unspoken is written in a different way from most YA books. - Kami the main character is witty, funny, determined, caring. - READ UNSPOKEN! In Long Unspoken has a great concept behind it and I was so excited about the whole idea that Kami has this person in her head who she talks to. I haven't ever read a book like it so I was really intrigued to see what sort of relationship Brennan had created between Kami and this guy who she talks to in her head. As soon as I started Unspoken I discovered that Brennan hasn't just written a storyline which is very unique but she has also written it in a unique way. It's hard to explain the sort of style that she has written this in but it's very unique, witty and quirky. I personally can't make my mind up about whether I like it or not and I know this will be the case for others as well as some hating and some loving it. However I think, for me, at most points it suits Unspoken, there was a few points that I got really confused and didn't understand something because of the style and also most indirect approach to what Brennan was trying to get across but for the majority of the time it worked. The story pretty much starts straight away and from the beginning I found myself addicted to the story, wanting to know more about this guy Kami was talking to. He had such an interesting character, one which made me want to find more out about him, especially who he was and where he was. As things started to unravel I did find that the storyline sometimes slowed down and this was often when I would realise I had to go to sleep or something and ended up putting the book down. I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get into to the point that I found myself picking it up at any free second I had. However when I did I found the story quickly picked back up again. Kami is a great character, there are so many different words that can be used to describe her; witty, funny, determined, caring, funny, daring etc. She is a character with so much personality, I straight away loved her! I would love to have her as a friend, I am sure she would cheer me up whenever I am feeling down. I don't want to give anything away about the guy inside her head but him and Kami has such an interesting relationship, I loved seeing how things developed and changed for them both. Final Thoughts I definitely recommend Unspoken if you're looking for a paranormal book which is different from any other paranormal book in many ways. Brennan has created a story with a magical feeling to it which will have you laughing out loud as well as on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out!",Jodie Lane
9780857078070,"I absolutely loved Unspoken. From the fantastic characters to the interesting plot and the funny quips that had me laughing out loud while reading this. It's shrouded in mystery and angst and kept me intrigued throughout. The Lynburns, the town's founders, have suddenly moved back to the big house on the hill. Kami, as editor of the school newspaper is trying to get the story on them. So when Jared Lynburn turns out to be the boy that Kami has spoken to inside her head ever since she can remember, it seems she has an inside source. Then the attacks begin. Kami, who aspires to be an investigative journalist, wants to figure out who's behind them, but she can't go to the police because they think Jared pushed her down the well. What secret's are the town, and the Lynburn's, hiding? I adored Kami, I think she's my favourite female protag of all time. I just really took to her. I loved her crazy personality and totally enjoyed all her mad antics. Angela was great too and her snarky, sarcastic comments gave me some good laughs. Jared was an awesome, leather jacket wearing, motor bike riding, mysterious bad boy. I feel we never really got to see the true Jared, he had walls built inside his head and didn't let Kami or the reader in. While there isn't an actual romance in Unspoken, the relationship that Jared and Kami shared seemed filled with tension which I really enjoyed. I'm still not actually sure if they liked each other romantically as both their emotions towards each other seemed to change at times or their actions would contradict their thoughts. They do love each other deeply though, and I like to think that it will eventually turn romantic. Which brings us to the cliffhanger ending. Why, why, why? It was just so cruel and I deducted a half star because of it. It was just too much for me. I can't believe I have to wait now until next June to see how things turn out.",Suzanne Finnegan
9781596434332,"Reason for Reading: Next in the series. This much awaited 3rd volume in The Olympians series was quickly read up. I'm quite familiar with the contents of this one and enjoyed the author's presentation of events. There are many stories and versions the author had his pick of which way he could go with these characters and he's chosen an age appropriate story and one which connects Hera and Heracles together perfectly. While the book does tell the story of Hera, there does come a point went it becomes the story of Heracles (ie. Hercules) whose name ""Heracles"" means ""Glory of Hera"". The book has mild violence, mythological creatures are killed but it never enters into the truly gruesome or s*xual nature of the original myths, keeping the material age appropriate. Hera and Heracles both have stubborn natures and as the book progresses one can tell they are more alike than they would freely agree. Hera's main story is told here but Heracles doesn't leave much more left to tell so I won't be surprised if he doesn't get his own book. But I do expect that Hera will keep popping up in future volumes to throw her curses or sympathies around and now we understand why she's been given such a bad rap all these years. It's all your fault, you philandering, Zeus!",Nicola Mansfield
9781442408548,"The characters were all one-dimensional and had no character flaws; I believe the author tried to build a perfect lovable-by-all strong female protagonist, but instead she succeeded in building a whiny, annoying, overbearing, spoiled, and illogical character who doesn't have any friends her parents hadn't paid to be hanging out with her, and who needs them to wipe her butt and do all the dirty work for her while she gets the credit. She messes up situations and blames other people for it. She bosses people around when she needs to be compassionate, and then cries and collapses in the face of real danger, needing others to save her. She friendzones a guy who truly cares about her, and keeps him as a backup in case the relationship with the hotter guy doesn't work out. This whole book is seething with insta-love, terrible cliches, gaping plot holes, predictable and cringeworthy scenes and ""plot twists"". I feel like the author got bored with her own writing about halfway into the book, and her editor quit about two-thirds of the way in. The ending is one big hot mess, and the last chapter was just a narrative explanation of ""what the hell is going on"". HOWEVER! I should mention that I'm a 30-year-old. This book was clearly written for teenagers. So maybe if I was a teenager, I would have enjoyed it more.",Olga

Loved the unique elements in there, ie: aspects of Samoan culture and protocol. That was lovely to read in a fiction. Not sure about the main male character - no doubt he is hot, but it started to feel like he was 'too' perfect. He had absolutely no faults!

There is humor, suspense, romance and all of it takes place in what has to be one of the most beautiful settings I have read about in a long time. The Samoa mythology is unique and anyone who loves Paranormal stories is going to love this. The characters are fantastic and realistic.

9781466253711,"Oh My Goodness. What to say about this book?... *taps finger in chin in contemplation* I just don't know what to say to do it justice. I always reflect on a book at the end and this time, I've come to my review without knowing what I am going to say. I'm just typing and hoping it makes sense. So I'll start at the beginning. I was asked to review TELESA as part of the RABT tours and I signed up right away. From the synopsis, I knew it was something different and intriguing. I haven't come across anything like it before and as I am always keen to try new things, this appealed to me. Take a look at the cover and I defy you not to see it's unequalled beauty. At first, I wasn't sure how it linked to the story, but that is something you discover as you journey into Samoa with Leila as your guide! LeilaFolger is 18 years old. She's just lost her father and feels lost and alone. She doesn't want to keep living with Grandmother Folger and so decides to undertake a journey to Samoa. A journey of discovery that leads her to find out things she never expected were possible. Upon arriving in Samoa, she is met by Aunty Matile and Uncle Tuala. Aunty is a sour-faced woman and is quick to dash Leila's hopes of an enjoyable 3 month stay. The way she is so curt with Leila. You would do well to always respect Aunty though. She is a woman you wouldn't want to cross. Leila has come to Samoa in search of vital information. She wants to know about her family. Specifically about her mother. The mother she never had because she died in a hurricane when Leila was just a baby. But Aunty isn't happy about this and is quick to tell Leila that she would do well not to bring up the subject of her mother - and any time Leila tries, she is only met with a fierce resistance. Aunty believes that what she is doing by not telling Leila anything, is protecting her from the harsh truth about the kind of woman her mother was. So Leila settles into a routine of going to school, home and of course, church. She's not to go anywhere else. Aunty Matile and Uncle Tuala do their best to enforce this, for Leila's own protection. It's at school that she meets Daniel. The devastatingly handsome Head Boy, or should I say Chunk Hunk...? (you'll get that reference when you read the book) He's handsome, sweet, kind... He could never be interested in Leila... could he...? Leila is glad that settling into SamCo (Samoa College) is easier than she had expected. She's used to American ways and social cliques that she's never been a part of. But though SamCo has some of it's own cliques, this time Leila feels a part of everything. Thanks in large to her fa'afafine friend Simone. He's the most feminine boy she's ever met. Finely manicured hands. Subtly applied eye-liner. But he's funny and kind, making Leila feel completely at ease in his company. I won't go too much into the real gritty part of the story, that's a journey for you to embark upon. What I will say is this... As the story unfolds, you are taken on a magical journey. Lani Wendt Young has written this from her heart. As a girl born in Apia, Samoa - it is clear to see she loves the land that she is from and it has inspired the most beautiful story. With a beautiful fluidity, TELESA is more than just a story. It's more than just mere words on a page. It's a journey that you undertake and come out smiling on the other side. Yes, there are hard times to go through. Yes, there are ups and down, twist and turns. But those all add to the beauty of it. I can say in all honesty that Lani Wendt Young has shot to the top of my 'new favourite authors' list and TELESA has been added to my 'most-favourite' list on Goodreads, but also to my mental lists of 'favourite books of 2012' & 'favourite books EVER'. It's clear that Lani poured her heart and soul into creating this amazing story. I am in absolute awe of her at this moment in time. She created inspiring characters. The good and the evil. I adored Leila's quiet yet fierce strength and passion for what she believes in. Aunty Matile and Uncle Tuala are to of my favourite secondary characters. Simone is one of my favourite 'best friend' characters - I have never heard of anyone who is fa'afafine before - I absolutely adored him. As for Daniel. Oh. My. God. I cannot begin to explain how fiercely I loved him! There aren't enough words in my vocabulary. I was slightly tempted along the way by the beautiful Jason. I'll admit to imagining him stood there in his half-naked glory. But when it comes down to it, I am a one-man woman. Daniel stole my heart.

Honestly, I defy anyone who reads this not to cry. So grab yourself a box of tissues! I want to thank RABT for giving me this opportunity to read and review TELESA. If they had not offered it to me, I may never have discovered this book and what lies beneath. I am honoured to be part of the blog tour. A huge thank you must go out to Lani.

9780061288869,"I actually thought DANCE WITH A VAMPIRE, book four of the VAMPIRE KISSES series, was going to be the last one. So I was overjoyed to find out that the story of Raven and Alexander continues in THE COFFIN CLUB. It is now summer vacation and Raven is missing Alexander. At the end of the last book, Alexander and his caretaker, Jameson, left Dullsville for Hipsterville to return the young Valentine to his family, leaving Raven all alone. Now that school is out, Raven has decided to visit her cool Aunt Libby in Hipsterville. From her aunt, she learns that the creepy mansion in town is being rented. Immediately, Raven investigates and finds her beloved and Jameson camped out in the place. After a sweet reconciliation, Alexander rushes her out of the place to go on another mission. Raven is left wandering the town waiting for her aunt to finish up one of her classes. She ventures back to The Coffin Club (the infamous place where she first encountered the evil Jagger, Valentine's older brother) and stumbles upon the Dungeon. The Dungeon is the coolest place below the main club. It is also members only. It takes Raven a while to figure out that the ""members only"" part means vampires. REAL vampires. And there she meets the hypnotic Phoenix. Phoenix may just have some secrets of his own. And Raven stumbles upon Jagger yet again. As the story develops, Raven gets caught up in the world of vampires and realizes that she does truly fit in with the vampire crowd. She meets two cool gals, Onyx and Sapphire, who befriend her. They accept her for who she is. And she finds out that most vampires just want to be who they are and lead as normal a life as possible. There is trouble brewing at the Dungeon between Jagger and Phoenix, and the vampire world in Hipsterville may forever be changed. Caught between the mortal and immortal world, Raven again struggles with who she should be. Does she give everything up to be with Alexander for eternity, or should she remain mortal and see how things progress? Ms. Schreiber keeps the reader coming back for more romance and adventure between Raven and Alexander. They are an unlikely romantic couple who enchants all. The story is light, with mostly action and little depth, but it is truly entertaining and fun. The story leaves the reader waiting for more yet again.",TeensReadToo
9780755378951,"I was very suprised by this book as I bought it for my 17 year old Grandaughter who was staying with me for a couple of weeks; she raved about it so I read it. While the young love side of the novel held little interest for me the rest was quite thrilling and suspensful Violet is the heroine and Jay the love interest. Murdered dead people call to Violet to discover their hidden bodies, while the murderers carry around the 'imprint' of those they have murdered. Violet sets out to find a serial killer who is murdering her friends. I won't give too much away Straight forwardly written with no medical or scientific jargon. I've just ordered the follow up book 'Desires of the Dead'......can't wait to see what Violet is up to",gail hartshorn
9780755378951,"Wow. Just wow. This was a seriously amazing book! The blurb sounds incredible and, for once, the actual story lived up to my expectations. When people started recommending The Body Finder to me, I wasn't too keen on checking it out... I mean, a girl who finds dead bodies everywhere? A little bit morbid, wouldn't you say. However, when folks started telling me that it's very romantic and not at all a horror story, I figured I'd give it a shot. Boy, am I glad I did. The plot is so unique and intriguing - definitely a good decision. Derting has mastered the art of suspenseful writing. For the first time in quite a while, I have absolutely no negative things to say about our leading lady - Violet. I thought she was an absolutely perfect heroine and I can't wait to read more about her. Jay, on the other hand, kind of annoyed me a little. Sure, he was cute and all and Violet was totally head over heels for him, but as a third-party reader, I found his protectiveness beyond irritating. Don't get me wrong, I thought he was a good character and all, but that one aspect of his just made me want to punch him. I think Chelsea might have been my favourite character overall. Though we don't really learn all that much about her, her brash nature and sarcastic wit was absolutely hilarious. I'm hoping the next book will feature more of her less-than-subtle personality. The romance in this novel was developed perfectly. A lot of YA novels feature the stranger who pops up and captures the heart of our lead, but Derting went in the opposite direction and made the love-interest someone who had been there all along. It was just so believable - I know first hand what it's like to know someone your entire life and realise one day that you're completely in love with them. I'm a huge fan of books with believable romance, and the fact that they already knew everything about each other stopped it from being too close to insta-love for my liking. I thought the most interesting part of this novel was when the killer would speak. Every few chapters we'd get a little insight into what was going on. Being inside his head was fascinating, to say the least. Though I thought he was a total creeper, he just seemed real, you know? It was also very refreshing to not be able to predict who the bad guy was... that's one thing that lets a lot of mystery novels down. Overall, this was an amazing book and I highly recommend it. The romance was beautiful and the mystery intriguing. The ending was absolutely fantastic, letting you believe one thing before hitting you with something completely different. Absolutely stellar. I can't wait to dig into the rest of this series.",justanotherteenagebookworm

Jack is very healthy, despite the thick scar that resides above his heart and the medicine he has to take every day. Life is ordinary - until he forgets to take his medicine. Soccer tryouts are a breeze. Jack has never felt so alive, and when his nemesis, Lobeck, gets in his way, Jack slams him into the goal - without touching him. Jack doesn't realize he is Weirlind, part of an underground society of magical people, and when he sent Lobeck flying into the soccer net, the magic he released acted as a signal to others around him. Jack, destined to be a wizard but born without his stone, was saved by a leader of the White Rose. The moment Jack's life was saved, his destiny changed. Now, with a warrior stone behind his heart, he is meant to fight for the White Rose in a magical tournament - if he survives until his magic fully manifests. Jack is one of the last warriors and both the Red and the White houses want him to fight for them. Whichever house wins the fight-to-the-death tournament has the power to control the magical community. In a world full of wizards, warriors, seers, sorcerers, and enchanters, Jack doesn't know who to trust. Nothing around him is as it seemed.

9780399254123,"FIRST SENTENCE: They took me in my nightgown. This book could be the next ""Diary of Anne Frank"", a book and play that I read and saw when I was a pre-teen, and then again later in life. These are the sorts of events that we SHOULD learn about in school, in order to keep us from repeating the same types of crimes against humanity. I am extremely grateful to Ms. Septys for writing this story and bringing to light a dark period of time for the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia), that not many know about. It is 1941, and Russia is marching across the land, annexing new countries by force and instituting Stalin's philosophies. In a country where being an intellectual is now a crime, many academics, and those suspected of original thinking, are rounded up, placed in rail cars, and ""repatriated"", either sold as slaves or put to work on ""collective farms"", many in the cold of Siberia, where the work is hard, rations are scarce, disease rages, firewood has to be stolen, and people die and are killed by the NKVD (Russian secret police) without repercussion. The novel takes you on a journey with Lina Vilkas, a talented 15-year-old artist, whose father Kostas is a university provost. Her loving family is rounded out by her mother Elena, elegant and beautiful, and her 10-year-old brother Jonas, a sweet-natured, fun-loving boy. Their nightmare begins on a night when Kostas didn't return home, and the NKVD pounds on the door, giving them 20 minutes to pack and leave. Their mother, having anticipated this eventuality, has sewn valuables into the lining of her coat, and spends some of the prep time breaking her other valued possessions to keep them out of Soviet hands. The truck they are loaded into waits for a while in front of a hospital. A mother is giving birth, and she and her newborn are taken directly afterward and placed in the truck with the 15 already there. As groups are loaded into boxcars labeled ""thieves and prostitutes"", the long, cold, and deadly journey begins, spanning years with no relief and ever-increasing hardship. Lina's story is an amalgamation of many of the stories of the survivors of this period of time. Even after 10-15 years of forced labor, death, loss of family and possessions, when the survivors eventually returned to their homeland, they were forbidden to speak of what had happened to them. Ms. Sepetys brings their stories to vivid life, and even as your heart aches, there is hope engendered on these pages. A hope that these stories will put an end to oppression and brutality ... and a hope that we never forget the consequences of such acts. An emotionally powerful, beautifully-wrought novel, Between Shades of Gray should be on everyone's reading list. QUOTES (from an ARC; may be different in final copy): The priest looked up, flung oil, and made the sign of the cross as our train rolled away. He was issuing last rites. I heard a scream and saw the limp body of a child heaved out into the mud. A woman tried to jump out after the corpse. She was smashed in the face by the butt of a rifle. I saw another body thrown out. Death had begun to gather a crop. The next day, the guards dragged her stiff body out of the train. Her mother jumped down after her, crying. A gunshot fired. A thud hit the dirt. A grieving mother was an annoyance.",Julie Smith

9780310727613,This interpretation of Beauty and the Beast was well written and did a good job of adapting the story to a historical romance that did not involve fantasy elements. This version takes place in England during the mid 1300's and unlike in most versions the character of Beauty has 2 brothers and a mother instead of 2 sisters and her father. I thought the author did a good job of showing the inner emotions of both Annabel and Lord Ranulf le Wyse.,Chelsea K.
9780310727613,"I love Beauty and the Beast and this retelling is wonderful. I normally do not like historic fiction, this I did not want to put down. Set in England during the 1300's, The Merchant's Daughter had a real feel for the time period. The characters were complex and the story never dragged. I liked how the heroine Annabelle was strong and brave but all the while searching to understand God better. This is one story I would recommend to teens and women alike. It is a clean, Christian romance and I give it 4 stars.",Dani Chapman
9780310727613,"After the death of Annabel's father three years ago, her family didn't have money to pay the censum - to keep them from working like the rest of the villagers. Her family managed to bribe the old lord's steward, shirking their duty. But things were about to change when a new lord came to Glynval. Her family needed to pay an expensive fine or work with the people during harvest time while one of them served Lord le Wyse as a servant. There was one other option: Annabel could marry Bailiff Tom who would pay the family's censum. But for Annabel, that was an option she wasn't willing to consider. She volunteered to be Lord le Wyse's servant instead of marrying the bailiff. Annabel's character was gentle, kind, compassionate, loyal, understanding and loving. She's the kind of girl who was beautiful inside and out. From being a free woman she became a servant, bound to doing heavy household chores and running errands for her lord. She never complained but instead worked hard to fulfill her duties. As she stayed at the manor, she turned out to be a better servant than the ones who have served Lord le Wyse for a longer time. She really cared about her job and her lord. But staying at the manor meant being close to Bailiff Tom and that made her uneasy and scared. Ranulf, the new lord, was physically beastly according to the people of Glynval. Worse, he had a temper. But his imperfection and temper were the results of his past. He had melancholy and painful experiences that made him who he was. But deep inside, he was a perfect gentleman who looked out for other people and always came to the rescue - mostly to Annabel's rescue. I've encountered characters in other novels that had a hero complex. Ranulf was not one of them. I liked that he acted out of concern and not for attention. Another thing that I liked about him was his concern for the welfare of his servants. He wanted make sure they were fed, safe and didn't have problems. Annabel and Ranulf's relationship as servant and lord bloomed into something more. Although it was filled with tension and uneasiness, they've seen past their physical appearance and knew one another in a deeper way through their encounters. The connection between the two was undeniable. Soon tension gave way to understanding, concern and love. I loved how the romance developed between the two: from full-blown awkwardness to sweetness. The characters in the novel were diverse and realistic. Most of them - the ones who really mattered - were well-developed. I enjoyed reading about them. The plot was interesting and well-thought. Even though I knew how the story of Beauty and the Beast goes, I was never bored with The Merchant's Daughter. The ambiance and culture of Medieval Glynval, England were refreshing. The author gave attention to detail, especially with the parts of the novel related to the judicial system, and I admire her for that. Captivating, dramatic and moving, The Merchant's Daughter offers a darker, sadder and more romantic version of Beauty and the Beast. I highly recommend this to historical readers, romance readers and retelling fans!",Precious

After Annabel Chapman's father, a wealthy merchant, dies, her family is left with nothing but debt. Annabel choses to work as a servant to the new lord of her village, Lord Ranulf le Wyse rather than marring the repulsive Bailiff Tom. Annabel has heard tales of the lord as a monstrous beast, while he is scarred terribly he couldn't be more ""beastly"". She begins to respect him; the lord even becomes a haven for Annabel when the bailiff sends unwelcomed advances toward her. While Annabel never intended to marry anyone, she wanted to become a nun, but her family couldn't pay the expenses, she can't help the feeling that start to grow for Lord le Wyse. I'm not a huge Christian fan, but this book was easy to read even though Annabel reads from the bible every night but I kind of skimmed over those parts.

If that wasn't enough, everyone's powers are messed up. Anything I write in this review is not going to do any justice. I loved everything that was written. There are so many ups and downs, twists and turns and just too many things to write about. The characters come more into their own in this one. The story line is well written and I just love the whole southern vibe. I love Ethan and Lena's love story and how they stand by each other no matter what. Ridley and Link are just too funny, they are some of my favorite characters in this series. I was pleasantly surprised by a new relationship that develops, you'll have to read the book to find out who it is. I enjoyed learning about Sarafine and who she was before she turned dark. Macon is always popping up when you least except him to which just makes it more interesting. Oh yeah and I can't leave out the cliffhanger ending. Yeah it's the best one yet!

9780316036207,"Previously published on my blog: http://fictionfervor.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/review-angel-by-james-patterson/ I generally don't review books in a series without reviewing the books before it, except I figured that you didn't want a review of a book that I barely remembered! So, a fair warning right now. If you haven't read all the other books in the series, don't read this review. It may be fairly spoilery. Angel was a bit of a disappointment for me. After the big bang that Fang ended with, I was expecting something bigger. More dramatic. More heartbreaking. I suppose it was heartbreaking in a way, though. What with Dylan becoming closer to Max (and I being completely and utterly Team Fang), I was devastated. My love for Max has diminished greatly. I used to love her witty quips and hilarious moments (and I still do, to some extent), except now Max's take on things have become less important to me. She's become sillier. Confused and addled, I admit, but sillier. On the other hand, I loved Angel's development from bossy seven-year-old to caring and mature kid. At the end of Fang, I definitely wasn't as big a fan of Angel as I used to be. But Angel increased my respect for the little seven-year-old girl with each act of kindness she did for Max and the flock. The plot of the book was generally good, though a little silly. Seriously, a Doomsday group? Full of kids? Not realistic. Especially since the kids are hypnotized. But I enjoyed watching Max and the flock use kick-butt methods to try to defeat the cult. And with the ending of this book, I have a feeling that James Patterson is getting fond of cliffhangers. All in all, though I was generally disappointed with the overall plot and romance, I think Angel would be a good read for any paranormal romance lover, though you might find it different from the regular PR.",Linda
9780316036207,"Fang has left, and Max, hurt and bewildered, has no idea how to function anymore. She knows that the world still needs saving - that life is bigger than just the two of them - but it is one thing to say it and another to believe it. When the deserter, he-whose-name-must-never-be-mentioned, suddenly fires a call their way out of the blue, Max, Dylan, and the gang are dragged into yet another plot for world domination - or, in this case, mass destruction. The Doomsday Group has suddenly sprung up out of nowhere. With its hypnotic figurehead, the DG is gaining followers fast. After witnessing a group rally, the two groups led by Max and Fang journey to the DG's headquarters in an attempt to crush the cult right at its roots. Never underestimate a group of crazed and fanatical humans, even if they aren't genetically enhanced, even if they aren't the future of mankind, as the DG have started to call Max and her little group. The future of mankind, huh? That is quite a title. Followers of the MAXIMUM RIDE series have come a long way, from Max's first discovery of her real identity to the various times her gang has successfully thwarted a crazed scientist or politician of some sort. ANGEL, this newest installment of the series, brings forth with it yet another villain to eradicate, which makes it feel as if the former books of the series don't matter at all plot-wise. However, Max has not lost her sarcastic touch and gangstah attitude, and the presence of Dylan creates - yes, you guessed it - a love triangle. Really, Mr Patterson, I expected more of you. MAXIMUM RIDE started out as a fresh new series and has now been reduced to just another teen paranormal novel, in terms of characterization, at least. While the plot of this book grabbed the reader's attention, there was not much depth to it. Even so, I could not resist reading the novel in one sitting, so I suppose I shouldn't be complaining. I did feel like Mr. Patterson was making too much of an effort to sound like a teen girl, though. Yes, Max is fifteen, but like, teen girls don't like, OMG, add in a ""like"" every few words when they like, talk, you know? I was fifteen four months ago. Trust me; I know what I'm talking about. Despite all that, MAXIMUM RIDE is addictive and a very fun series to read.

He seems to know more than anything else and is wholly prepared for any disaster. The things he would say were intelligent, witty and very wise. He quickly diffused any situation only because he's a master of people. My guess was that he was an operative for the government. Another thing that I enjoyed about this was the location. It's not every day you get to read a book based on a suburban city you know. I enjoyed reading about the neighbourhood and streets that I drive by almost every week. This is a more civilized and realistic view of how the world would come to be if there was no power. I wished there was a reason as to why it happened though. I kept hoping for something to come from the ham radio waves, but there was none. I really wished there was a clearer view of why the power and all electronics as they know it has ceased to work.

9781416961338,"So this book was... long. I was pining for this book since the beginning of summer; it was the perfect summer read! Then I started reading it.. and the story never seemed to end. I feel like when I was 200 pages in, that nothing REALLY happened.. I guess that's the point of why it's a summer read right? It's still summer here, weather goes up to 35 celsius (HOT!) so its not the season, but I think its about what represents summer. In summer we have all the time in the world to do ANYTHING, while now, I'm scrambling to juggle my studies, going out, sleeping, reading, and updating our blog! So very stressful, takes the joy out of a summer read. Now let's get down to the actual reviewing. While this book was long, I did find it entertaining, atleast in some stories (with a book this long there had to be more side stories). It is told from almost 3 people's POVs, Summer, Marquez, and Diana. At first I found summer na??????-ve, Marquez great, and Diana just plain old depressing. But as the story progressed and Summer started falling for every guy alive (really?) and Marquez with her ex-boyfriend trouble (again enjoyable), and Diana finally getting out of her funk and standing up for herself (you go girl!) I started looking forward to Diana's chapters the most. I truly admired her resilience to finally stand up for herself, no matter how big and rich the opponent is. Summer honestly dragged the story, its first deciding who she loves out of all these guys, then keeping him at an arm's length because she's afraid of getting hurt (summer fling and all), then it's about her family issue (I don't want to post spoilers). I just feel like her story dragged a bit. All in all, I think I read this book at the wrong time so my review might have been different if say, I read it during my summer break, but I'm glad I finally got to read it and get it out of my system, no more pining!.

9780062217073,"REBOOT is a 2013 debut with a very intriguing concept functioning as potent YA readers' bait. The entire Reboot idea proved to be pretty interesting, human teenagers dying and rebooting after their death to become stronger and more resilient versions of their former selves. Amy Tintera described them to look like humans just with transformed shiny eyes and stronger body features. But they weren't always a tangible concept for me. Sometimes the Reboots gave off an almost cyborg-like vibe, their characters seeming to shift between human, machine and zombie attributes. High appeal had the fact that, after rebooting, Wren has almost zero emotions left and she would be confronted with feelings that should be non-existent by now. Callum, her announced love interest remains almost human after his death. I was very excited for their love story, as I imagined it to be very fierce and troublesome, with bickering and an emotional chaos for Wren. The imbalance between them was what promised to make their love story something to look forward to. In the end the relationship between 178 and 22 came along too manageable and without any major doubts on Wren's part. As she is always described as a calculating heartless being she should at least spend some time struggling, and I just didn't see that. Wren's character was strong otherwise and everyone respected her. It was Callum's character who could have used to appear edgier. Some time around the middle of the book, something happened that resulted in my discontentment. And after that I felt my attention being gradually diverted. I hoped for Wren's and Callum's training phase to be more intense and more emphasis put on Wren's life in the HARC complex. The strong enthusiasm I held for Amy Tintera's Reboots in the first few chapters of the book, couldn't make it to the end. The story's overall feel was inherently consistent and attractive with its dystopian and sci-fi elements. There are Reboots, rebels and the ominous HARC organisation. Everything the Reboots do, is controlled and observed by guards and scientists. REBOOT is set in Texas, but not the Texas we know today. Cities were destroyed in uproars, most of the population killed. Pretty scary! Sadly the explanation - stories with these kind of fatal developments in general - behind the Reboot procedure just didn't seem to work for me. Even though their stories are based on different basic set-ups, to some extent REBOOT reminded me of the reading impression I got from WITHER by Lauren DeStefano and EVE by Anna Carey. 3,5/5 ***/* REBOOT - Extremely inventive Reboot concept with a weaker story line towards the end. Epic Reads tea time. That's where I first heard about Amy Tintera's debut and it was clear this was a 2013 debut I wouldn't put on hold for too long. I recommend you to pick it up as soon as possible, I'm sure it will find a place on many readers' favourites shelves. REBOOT could be a good read for people who enjoyed WITHER by Lauren DeStefano and EVE by Anna Carey.",MissPageTurner
9780062217073,"Seven Reasons Why You Need to Read Reboot NOW 1. Story world. The story world Amy Tintera has crafted is one-of-a-kind. In fact, I didn't even realize that it's sort of a zombie tale until I read a review describing it as one. In Reboot, some humans that died of the KDH virus reboot, or wake up a stronger, faster and less emotional version of themselves. The longer it takes for the human to reboot, the less of his or her humanity remains. At 178 minutes, Wren is an unfeeling Reboot, the deadliest among them all. Reboots serve as soldiers of the HARC. 2. Wren. Wren is one kickass heroine. She is so cool and badass and she can kill you without batting an eyelash. I like my heroines strong yet secretly feeling and doubting. Still, she has her flaws and insecurities and my heart just went out to her as I got to know her. Her morbid past, how she coped, how she lives now by the HARC's orders, how she cares for her roommate Ever, everything about Wren will make the reader love her. Moreover, I especially like the imminent turnaround of her character from unfeeling to feeling when she met and got to know Callum. Which is the third reason why you should read Reboot! 3. Callum. Callum, oh Callum. At twenty-two minutes, Callum is pretty much human still. His skin is not as cold as Wren's, he still has color in his skin, his reflexes are more like of a human and he's still emotional. Callum is such an endearing character and a total contrast to Wren. While Wren doesn't even bat an eyelash when it comes to killing, Callum would rather die than kill someone. It's his humanity, evident care and worry for Wren and SMILE that ultimately broke Wren's barriers and made her feel and more alive than ever. 4. Callum and Wren. Goodness. As much as Reboot is a dystopian at its core, I think it's actually equal parts action and romance. Callum and Wren's relationship was definitely the spotlight as everything Wren did was for Callum and everything Callum did was for Wren. Everything else were just consequences of their actions or ways to ultimately protect each other. It was past midnight then and my shirt's in my mouth to muffle the sounds as I squirmed and squealed in happiness and giddiness and sweetness. Some people found Reboot's love story an instalove one but I didn't notice that at all. I guess I was too smitten by Callum and too awed by Wren but I just bought their romance. Sure, Wren goes from a 178 to a pile of mush and goo, trying to save Callum all of a sudden, but can you blame her? She died when she was 12 and nobody ever treated her like Callum did. No one broke through her barriers, her walls. No one took the time to get to know her. Which made her seem aloof. But Callum never shied away from her, poked at the right buttons and in return, Wren opened up to him, cared for him. I just adore how much they care for each other. I guess you'd have to suspend disbelief and just believe in the power of love to thaw someone's heart. Gah, that was so cheesy but this book made me sappy and such a hormonal teenager. 5. Cover. Reboot's cover is simple but I find it really good because even with the minimalist design, it's completely relevant to the novel. Each Reboot has a barcode in their wrist indicating how many minutes passed before they rebooted. The cover shows a 178. The sleek black and the contrast of red just makes you want to grab the book in your bookstore and check it out, right? 6. Action. The action in Reboot is off-the-charts! While a lot of the novel was spent inside the HARC facility, the missions and their imminent plans were so action-packed. At the end, all hell breaks loose and action fans like me will drool in its awesomeness. Some people found the events at the end a bit rushed but it is rushed. They were pressed for time! And you know how in action movies all the good blowing up and crashing and exploding happens at the end and how everything happens too fast, that's how it is in Reboot. So I have no qualms that the end was so packed with events because that's how you do it! I think teenage boys will definitely enjoy the action side to this but be wary though with the romance. But just imagine Chloe Moretz as Wren, there will be no problems at all. (Chloe Moretz is hot. Yes, I know she's young but can you just imagine her guns ablazin' and running and fighting? In my mind, Chloe Moretz IS Wren. The physical descriptions fit too!) 7. All the possibilities and room to explore. The ending just showed us a glimpse of the multitude of plots and twists that the world and story of Reboot can offer. Reboot is truly just the beginning and it has successfully established the whole series. It already explained how the population has been decimated by a virus, how the HARC controls humans and reboots alike and it already paved the way for all the wonderful plot arcs that will come. I am so excited for the sequel right after reading Reboot that I dreamed about possible events in book 2. Seriously, I dreamed them. I was tossing and turning in my sleep because of all the blood and action I witnessed in my dream. You can say I got obsessed with Reboot. Who dreams about sequels still not published? Apparently, me. I remember staying up until 3AM just to finish this novel when I had to wake up early that morning. I honest to goodness read this in one sitting. With a radically distinctive premise and story world, a kickass heroine, a very endearing hero and love interest, a makes-you-weak-in-the-knees romance, Reboot is a more-than-engaging page-turner. I highly recommend this to fans of the dystopian genre and to those looking for a fresh take on the zombie fare. I also recommend this to romance fans alike. Go read Reboot NOW!",Dianne @ Oops!

9780062217073,"(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to HarperTeen and Edelweiss.) 17-year-old Wren is dead. Five years ago she was shot in the chest and died, then 178 minutes later, when everyone thought she was dead, she rebooted. Reboots are the result of a virus, which kills people, and then causes them to wake from the dead. The longer it is between dying and waking up, the stronger and less-human the reboot is. Wren was dead for 178 minutes, making her the deadliest reboot ever. The most experienced Reboots have to train the newbies when they arrive, and as the highest number reboot at 178, Wren gets first pick. Wren always picks the new reboot with the highest number, as they are the toughest, and have the highest chance of survival. This time though, Callum, a boy who was dead for only 22 minutes, challenges Wren - are the reboots she trains the best because they have the highest numbers (were dead the longest), or are they the best because she trains them? Wren slowly begins to realise that she does have emotions, and knowing that Callum will die if she doesn't train him, she takes on the responsibility, even though her fellow reboots think she's gone nuts. Is it the number or the training though? Can Wren save Callum? And can she save herself? This was an enjoyable sci-fi/dystopian story, but I didn't enjoy the romance as much as I would have liked to. Wren was quite closed-off and hard at the start of the book, she showed very little emotion, although whether that is because she's a reboot or because she has to be to do what she does I don't know. She seemed fairly normal as far as teenage girls go really, other that the having to kill people, but even though she claimed to not have emotions, she obviously cared about her best friend Ever, and she also adhered to the social rules of the cafeteria, and only sat where the others expected her to sit, which showed that she obviously cared about what other people thought of her. I though Callum daring her to take him on was a clever move on his part. While she would probably have ignored him if he'd asked for any other reason, giving her a challenge worked well! While there was a romance between Wren and Callum, it was pretty tame. There was a bit of playful flirting from Callum, and we did eventually get a couple of kisses, but there was none of that heart-pounding stuff that makes you want to read through it again unfortunately. I also thought that even once Wren had realised that she liked Callum, she still viewed him as more of an assignment than a partner. I did like the main storyline about the reboots. I thought that it was a great idea to have dead kids who still function, as compared to zombies, and there seemed to have been quite a lot of thought put into the world building. I did think that Wren's plans were often a little lacking though, although I suspect this was done on purpose to show how she was swayed by her emotions. I liked the ending, although it wasn't quite what I was expecting. There were quite a few questions left unanswered, and more to explore in the next book, and it will be interesting to see what happens to the reboots from here! Overall; a good start to a sci-fi/dystopian series. 7 out of 10.",Sarah Elizabeth
9780062217073,"""Humans had a brightness to them, a glow that only death extinguished."" Amy Tintera's Reboot is, in some ways, fairly original. Instead of your typical, run-of-the-mill zombies, we have Reboots, humans aged 20 or under that are rebooted to life mere minutes after their death. The longer the wait between death and the process of rebooting, the less humanity is preserved when they awake. Wren Connolly was dead for 178 minutes. At a training facility for the Human Advancement and Repopulation Corporation, Wren uses her incomparable strength and speed to prepare new Reboots, who are, essentially, puppet soldiers for HARC. Enter Callum Reyes, or Callum Twenty-Two, a boy whose measly 22 minutes of death make him more human than most Reboots. Of course, from here on out we have a romance, but thankfully, this is a romance that is fairly pleasant for the most part, even if a fraction too rapidly paced. It is Callum who helps clear the fog behind Wren emotionless eyes. It is Callum who draws to surface the flickering strands of Wren's true personality. It is Callum's smile and Callum's boyish enthusiasm... He is adorable, to put it simply, and even Wren can't quite disagree. While Wren and Callum make a great team together - one that you can't help but root for - the romance does, on occasion, overshadow the plot and dampen the whole concept of Reboots. Wren's development from cold, determined One Seven Eight, to (arguably) love-struck teen is questionable. Nevertheless, Reboot remains entertaining and engaging throughout, though it must be said that the second half loses the vigour present during the first. The ending is brilliant, however, and a sure enough reason to return to this series. Rating: 3.5 stars",Sam
9780062217073,"One book in and I'm totally hooked on Amy Tintera! Reboot is the perfect match for my picky, sci-fi loving heart. Tintera manages to make Wren feel human and worth rooting for, even though she is essentially dead and meant to be a cold-hearted killing machine, thanks to the government. She was dead 178 minutes, which means she's one of the best (with the longest known reboot time) and the least human among the Reboots. Wren is badass and calculating, while also managing to feel like a teen girl (albeit one in a super weird situation) and show the kind of vulnerability and hope not expected from someone intended to be a heartless soldier. Then there's Callum. Oh, Callum. He was only dead for 22 minutes, which makes him kind of a joke among the Reboots and a possibly hopeless case to those in charge. He's sweet and smiley and the perfect balance to Wren's closed off resignation. He never quite fits in, but doesn't seem to mind enough to wipe the smile off his face. Without him, the story would've been much darker and Wren's hopeful side would've likely stayed buried until she died for the second and final time. Reboot is a great mix of action, weird, evil, science plot, and humor that keeps the reader hooked throughout. There is a second book in the works, so everything wasn't solved by the last page, but the conclusion of this book was enough of an ending to not leave you feeling confused or lost or irritated. It ends, but then there's a possibility for more... and you really want to know what's on the other side of that possibility. Reboot is a good choice for fans of Divergent or Joss Whedon's Dollhouse. And it released yesterday, so snag a copy ASAP. {Read the rest of my reviews at StoryboundGirl dot com!}",Sarah Blackstock
9780062217073,"I liked Wren as a main character. She was different, but a heroine who could kick butt and take names. The premise is fantastic and got my attention from the first time I saw it. I think that the world building was balanced. I got a good idea of why the virus and reboot happened and the effects on society. Callum was a superb secondary character and love interest. He brought out the character development with Wren and it was great how his smile and the fact that he retained so much of his humanity highlighted the personality and emotions of Wren that she'd previously buried. I really enjoyed being in Wren's head. She was tough, and I got to see her humanity come out and see her make her own decisions through her interactions with Callum and her friend and roomie Ever. There was a great mix of action and character building, and I was glued to the pages and essentially finished in one sitting on the train back from Boston. I was thankful for the lack of interruptions. Some might be frustrated that the romance and building of it almost takes front seat to the robot elements, but for me felt just right. I think that Wren has reservations and that she had a hard time breaking free from the expectations on her, and Callum influenced that change in her a lot. But he wasn't the only one and for that I am grateful. The experiments and differences between Wren and Ever also shepherds some of this change. The plot of this book tied up pretty well, giving me the right balance of closure and yearning for the next book to find out what happens next.

9781607069829,"A romp through the uncharted west with Lewis & Clark but this time while also cataloguing the flora & fauna they have a purpose to rid this untamed land of any monsters they come across and in this first volume that they do, one of the flora variety, the other more fauna. First they meet up with beasts half man and half bison, these guys are humongous and enjoy eating little human beings. Along comes Sacajawea, who they had expected to be meeting anyway, and saves the day. Next, when they reach their first destination the fort has been abandoned except for a few monstrous plant people. Quickly discovering how to kill them, the majority of the book is spend on figuring out how to go about eradication an entire forest region of man-eating, zombifying, plant people. Of course Sacajawea saves the very life of Lewis & Clark at the last minute but there is something sinister no-one knows yet that the explorers have made a deal that has to do with the unborn child she is carrying. This is a fun story, especially if you know your history as little in-jokes of humour pop-up but it is all quite light and these two plots felt episodic while the ending sets us up for the next step of the journey and we've been given a hint as to what possible variety of ""monster"" they will meet next. The art is just about what one can expect, professional looking but nothing special. Would read the next volume, but only if I came across it at the library or some such.",Nicola Mansfield
9781442450417,"A Quick Review! This novel took me by surprise on how engaging it was. Though Vane was truly an annoying and whinny male protagonist, I enjoyed his growth through the novel as he learned who and what he was with Audra's help. This is my first paranormal YA involving elementals, but it was easy to follow the author's vision. Essentially, it had all the elements in a YA paranormal romance that I love. Great chemistry between both Vane and Audra, exciting action packed plot, and a riveting story that kept me engaged from beginning to end.",Lily
9781442450417,"Within the first chapter of this book, I knew was going to love it. The narration was beautiful, the characters are great, the feelings are so ANGST! I like how the author doesn't try to necessarily hide things from the reader. She hides them from the characters, which makes the readers more invested in the growth of Vane and Audra. Audra...such a gorgeous, fleshed-out, realistic, amazingly bad-ass character. She was believable, she was hurt, she was awesome. You feel bad for her, right at the get-go, and sometimes you just want to smack her over the head and yell, ""IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!"" But of course, that's the whole premise of her personal crisis and character growth. I loved Vane as well, but his feelings for Audra were just a little too superficial for me. I mean yes, we get it that you think she's hot. But stop objectifying her! He does talk about her personality, but at the end of the day it comes down to how gorgeous she is, blah blah blah, and that he wants to desperately kiss her. And then when he finds out that he can't kiss anyone without, like, permantently bonding to her, then he doesn't believe it (but he believes everything else Audra says to him). I guess love is just clouding his better judgement. And he says ""freaking"" too much. I like how the crisis is set up right at the beginning with Audra making a mistake and trying to fix it by preparing Vane for when the Stormers (bad guys) come. Shannon Messenger is good about developing the rest of the story and the characters at the same time. The book isn't necessarily fast-paced, but it's not slow either. It's at a really great middle-ground where the author takes the take to build the world of the sylphs, or Windwalkers, while working out Vane and Audra's connection with one another. Both characters are ridiculously good-looking, of course, but I'll let it slide, seeing as the characters aren't really human. Audra's flashbacks are really heart-wrenching too. They probably make the book for me, because you can see what kind of person she was before she was broken by what happened to her, and you can see the kind of person Vane was as well. The author is also really great at doling these out in small amounts, stretching them across the book so that the reader is slowly piecing everything together, which moves the story along really well. The one thing that I absolutely hated was the Canadian stereotypes in the first couple of chapters. Vane goes on a date with a Canadian girl. At first I was excited. I was like, REPRESENT! But then it just went downhill the first time he made fun of her for saying ""aboot."" I mean, come on, Canadians don't say ""about"" any different than Americans. Second, we don't say ""eh"" all the time, or at all, but this book makes it seem like we say it every other sentence. Puh-lease. The only people I know who say it that often are Bob and Doug Mackenzie, and they're doing it in parody. There's so much more to Canadian culture than snow, hockey, beavers, and our oh-so recognizeable vocabulary. Please, American authors, at least try to move past the stereotypes. It's getting old. Beyond that, the book was amazing. The climax was incredible, the setting was perfect, and I can't wait to read the next book and see where Shannon Messenger takes the story. What worked for me, actually, was that this book could function as a stand-alone. Not everything is resolved, but I think it could work. But I'm till glad that she's writing more, because I'm definitely invested in this story and these characters.",Janita Van Dyk
9781560970095,This volume continues the high standards set forth in the previous volumes. It is a balance of old folk tales retold with Usagi as the protagonist and Usagi's new adventures with his friends and foes. There is more of Stan's distinctive humour and the odd cameo by faces you may know from other comics. There doesn't seem to be the engagement of previous volumes as we aren't learning more about Usagi's own tale. The art is still great and this volume shouldn't disappoint with the reappearance of some old faces. Thumbs Up!,365 Graphic Novels
9780762439492,"You know, I'm pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. There really aren't any ""bad"" stories in it, more like.. ""okay"" stories and ""better"" stories. I intended to write a short review of each one, but then I realized that was a lot of writing and getting up and down and... yeah, so instead I'll give you a few reviews of the stories I liked best. Errant - Diane Peterfreund I'm not a big unicorn fan, I admit it. I think I got burned out when unicorns were all over the cartoons when I was a little girl. Then of course there was more recent youtube videos with unicorns that made them feel.. cheesy and hokey. That said, this short story was interesting and finally made them out to be a little more bloodthirsty and not quite all rainbows and ponies. Enjoyable story and I'll be looking into more of Peterfruend's writing. Lost - Justine Musk I really enjoyed this story about a girl who can find things that are ""lost"". I love mythology, though, so it isn't really a surprise that I enjoyed this as much as I did. Unlike some of the other stories in this book, this one had a definite beginning, middle and the perfect ending so, while I wish it had been longer, I was satisfied with what I read. The Spy Who Never Grew Up - Sarah Rees Brennan Hands down, my favorite story of the book. Okay, so I admit to rolling my eyes a little at the introduction of 69 the Spy, but the story got better from there, I promise! Such a fun and interesting take on an old story. I'm laughing remembering the introduction to the Queen even as I type this. This story alone is worth picking up this collection. Hare Moon - Carrie Ryan Oh Carrie Ryan, how I love you. Carrie has this way of turning zombies into something even more terrifying than zombies! Just the mere mention of the ""unconsecrated"" and I shiver and get cold chills. In this short story about Tabitha she gives you a small, perfect taste of her longer books and has me remembering I still need to read that second one - soon! A few surprises - I'm not a big Hush, Hush fan but the Becca Fitzpatrick story kind of blew me away with how good it was. Also, I think I'm done with vampires. Way too many vampire stories out there and when you start mixing them with other fantastical creatures (such as Djinn), it's too much. Overall enjoyable set of short stories and not nearly as mushy as I thought it would be!",Lydia Presley
