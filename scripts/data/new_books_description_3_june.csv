B00ESF28IU,Classic Seuss,"As topical today as when it was first published in 1938, this book tells of Bartholomew Cubbins (from Caldecott Honor winner Bartholomew and the Oobleck) and his unjust treatment at the hands of King Derwin. Each time Bartholomew attempts to obey the king's order to take off his hat, he finds there is another hat on his head. Soon it is Bartholomew's head that is in danger . . . of being chopped off! While The 500 Hats is one of Dr. Seuss's earliest works, it is nevertheless totally Seussian, addressing subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about: abuse of power (as in Yertle the Turtle), rivalry (as in The Sneetches), and of course, zany good humor!"

B00ESF28TO,Classic Seuss,"What's better than a lost treasure? Seven lost treasures! These rarely seen Dr. Seuss stories were published in magazines in the early 1950s and are finally available in book form. They include The Bippolo Seed (in which a scheming feline leads a duck toward a bad decision), The Rabbit, the Bear, and the Zinniga-Zanniga (about a rabbit who is saved from a bear by a single eyelash), Gustav, the Goldfish (an early rhymed version of the Beginner Book A Fish Out of Water), Tadd and Todd (about a twin who is striving to be an individual), Steak for Supper (in which fantastic creatures follow a boy home in anticipation of a steak dinner), The Strange Shirt Spot (the inspiration for the bathtub-ring scene in The Cat in the Hat Comes Back), and The Great Henry McBride (about a boy whose far-flung career fantasies are bested only by those of Dr. Seuss himself). An introduction by Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen traces the history of the stories, which demonstrate an intentional move toward the writing style we now associate with Dr. Seuss. Cohen also explores the themes that recur in well-known Seuss stories (like the importance of the imagination or the perils of greed). With a color palette enhanced beyond the limitations of the original magazines, this is a collection that no Seuss fan (whether scholar or second grader) will want to miss."

Written in prose instead of rhyme (unlike Seuss's later works), The King's Stilts nevertheless addresses subjects that we know Dr. Seuss was passionate about throughout his life: duty (as in Horton Hears a Who and Horton Hatches the Egg); the abuse of power (as in The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins and Yertle the Turtle); deceit (as in The Bippolo Seed and How the Grinch Stole Christmas)--and even cats (as in The Cat in the Hat and I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today)! Follow the Good Doctor's advice: After a hard day of work, have fun with a great book like The King's Stilts!"

B0081HTZSC,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"The highly anticipated third book in the critically acclaimed and bestselling series takes the art of being wimpy to a whole new level. Let's face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg's father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other manly endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father's efforts to change him. But when Greg's dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009:The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney's presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney's spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year's Day (he resolves to help other people improve, telling his mother, I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father's attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg's hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (Dear James, You smell), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team's perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the racket children's book authors have going. All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book. Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule. Ages 8-12. (Jan.) F&P level: T"

A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnatses. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the boys build character by spending all day, every day digging holes exactly five feet wide and five feet deep. There is no lake at Camp Green Lake. But there are an awful lot of holes.It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. But what could be buried under a dried-up lake? Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment--and redemption. *Includes a double bonus: an excerpt from Small Steps, the follow-up to Holes, as well as an excerpt from the New York Times bestseller Fuzzy Mud."
B000FCKPPI,Holes,"SMALL STEPS is a contemporary young adult novel from Louis Sachar, the New York Times bestselling author of the Newbery Award-winning smash hit phenomenon book and movie/DVD sensation Holes, and The Cardturner. Two years after being released from Camp Green Lake, Armpit is home in Austin, Texas, trying to turn his life around. But it's hard when you have a record and everyone expects the worst from you. The only person who believes in Armpit is Ginny, his ten-year-old disabled neighbor. Together, they are learning to take small steps. Armpit seems to be on the right path until X-Ray, a buddy from Camp Green Lake, comes up with a get-rich-quick scheme. X-Ray's plan leads to a chance encounter with teen pop sensation Kaira DeLeon, the Beyonce of her time, and suddenly Armpit's life spins out of control. Only one thing is certain: he'll never be the same again. Combining his signature wit with a unique blend of adventure and deeply felt characters, Sachar explores issues of race, the nature of celebrity, the invisible connections that shape a person's life, and what it takes to stay the course.

9780593359044,Minecraft Novels,"Chapter OneWe are moving.The text message had arrived at night, at exactly 12:01 A.M. Reading it now on the blinking family tablet, Cecelia wondered why Therese had waited until she was asleep before sending it. Cece loved and adored her best friend, and if there was anything she thought she knew about Therese, it was this: surely Therese would never abandon her.And yet, there it was, a single line packed with the possibility of disappointment: We are moving.Cece jumped out of bed and ran the whole way to her parents' bedroom.""They're moving, they're moving!"" She barged through the door.It was a Saturday, so Iya and Baba were still in bed late, each in their pajamas. They jumped, startled.""Ei, ei,"" Baba, who was also ""Daddy"" sometimes but insisted Cece refer to her parents using the traditional Yoruba terms, said. ""Why all this shouting this morning?""""And what did we say about knocking before entering?"" Iya, who was also ""Mummy,"" asked.""Yes, yes, okay, scold me later,"" Cece said. ""But we must go now.""""Because?"" Baba inquired.""Because Reesa and her family are moving and I won't be able to say goodbye if we don't leave right now!""It took quite a bit of prodding for them to boot up like slow computers and get up to speed. As they had decided it was too early to let her out alone, Cece managed to persuade them to come with. She literally had to drag them out of the house and into the cold morning, both still in their bathrobes. Cece herself was in her bathroom slippers, but who cared? Therese was leaving. All Cece could think about was getting there before it was too late.Gemshore Estate, their neighborhood in the island part of Lagos, was just waking up as well. The streets were empty but for the Saturday street sweepers. The swish swish of their brooms and the call of early birds were the only sounds for miles. Cece's parents paused to greet one of the sweepers, smiling and saying E kaaro oh! in a singsong voice. The sweeper himself chirped a sugar-sweet Good morning! Cece's way. But Cece was already out of earshot, abandoning her parents behind and running for Therese's.The family home of the Njingas, Therese's parents, was only six houses down from Cecelia's, but around the bend. Her parents finished their greetings and caught up as she turned the corner. Cece expected to see moving trucks and a lot of activity come into view as they neared the Njinga house. Instead, misty silence greeted them at the detached duplex. The garage door was rolled down, there was no car parked in the compound, and all the windows were shut.There was no one there.""What is happening? Where are they?"" Cece turned to her parents, a plea in her eyes. ""Where is Therese?""""Oh, honey,"" Iya said, and patted Cece's shoulder. ""I think we may be too late.""Back home, Cece sat at the dining table and tried to process what had just happened. How could Reesa do that? she thought. How could her one and only friend in the world just move away without telling her or giving her the opportunity to say goodbye?While Baba spoke on the phone, trying to reach Mr. Njinga for an explanation of the family's sudden disappearance, Iya made Cece her favorite beverage: hot chocolate with honey and marshmallows. Or, her favorite beverage when she was, like, five--not that Iya could be bothered to remember she was not five anymore. Cece was in need of warmth, though, and decided, Hot chocolate is fine, I guess. However, when it did come, she was too downbeat to drink any of it, and just let it sit there, getting cold.We were supposed to start Gemshore Secondary together on Monday. Cece picked at her fingers, nervous just at the thought. How am I supposed to start secondary school all on my own?While her mother rummaged around trying to make breakfast, Baba finished his phone call.""They're already at the airport,"" he announced after hanging up. ""They're getting ready to board. He says they're moving to a place called Scottsdale. It's in the USA.""""Why didn't she tell me it would happen so fast?"" Cece asked, to no one in particular. ""Why did she wait until last night?""""Well, Mr. Njinga says it was quite sudden and there was little time to plan. None of his children even knew they were moving this quickly--not Therese, not her brothers.""""But still . . .""""Honey dearest,"" Iya said. ""I know it feels horrible to lose your best friend, but I'm sure she would have told you if she could. Don't worry--once they land, you can speak to her on your Baba's phone.""Cece ate the rest of her breakfast in uncharacteristic silence. Midway through her meal of wheat bread with mayo and sausages, the tablet chimed again. Iya picked it up, put on her glasses, and squinted at it.""I think it's your friend,"" she said, and passed the iPad to Cece.I'm sorry I didn't tell you, the message from Therese read. It was very . . . fast.Cece put down the tablet and finished her breakfast. Once done, she went to the den, the only other room with a TV besides the living room, where her video gaming console was hooked up. She pulled a beanbag chair across, settled into the plush foam in front of the TV, booted up the unit, slipped on her headphones, and picked up her controller.After breakfast on weekends was often housekeeping time, then homework time, then screen time, which could be a game or TV. But the housekeeper had come early the day before--a public holiday--and helped Cece with folding her clothes and arranging her books and putting her socks in the washer. Today being a weekend following a public holiday also meant she had done her homework the day before. Now, all she had was free time to do whatever she wished with.But only as the game world wrapped around her did she remember that with Therese gone, she had no one to play Minecraft with.I spawn right at the heart of Silver Oaks Park.That is what Reesa and I named this Realm. There is no silver here, really, or oak trees. It was just the name we could come up with the first time we learned how to craft a sign out of wood planks and a stick. We stuck the sign in the ground, wrote in the letters, and named it our own private corner of the big world of Minecraft.What I'm calling the ""heart"" is really the house Reesa and I built three years ago at what is now the center of Silver Oaks. The spot started out as a place to hide at night, when I first began playing in Peaceful. I had stumbled upon the Realm while trying to avoid playing Survival Mode in any other difficulty. I was goofing around and searching for nearby players from around the estate to play with when I discovered this private server, open and unrestricted, and the only one around set to Peaceful. I joined it on a whim. The place looked empty and deserted back then. Then night came, and I thought monsters would come for me like in Survival, so I hid in this spot. But no monster showed up, and instead, i_am_therese spawned where I was, peered into my hiding spot, and asked what I was doing hiding in there. I told her, and she laughed, then explained to me that monsters did not exist in Peaceful. Or in her Realm. Just things like polar bears and iron golems, which don't bother you if you don't bother them. I later found out that her father had paid some guy to help host this Realm for her for the same reason I was trying not to play Minecraft elsewhere. And that was to avoid venturing into the big bad world of public servers on the internet.We became friends that night, and have been ever since. She told me her name was really Teresa, but that her grandparents, who were originally from Congo-Brazzaville, opted to call her Therese, after a once-popular French princess where they grew up. It had stuck, and everyone called her Therese now. But she asked that I call her Reesa for short. It was what she let only her best friends call her.I walk through the house we built together. It is no longer a small hiding spot, but now a mansion with more rooms than we can manage. We have crafted beds, books, bookshelves, carpets, banners, fences, gates. We have a small basement we built with cobblestone where we keep most of our booty. Our large living room has tall, floor-to-ceiling, stained glass windows. We crafted a few framed paintings and placed them around the house.But it is not only the mansion at Silver Oaks that is our stamp on the world. As I look over the balcony of the first floor of our house, I can see all the farms we have created. Wheat, beetroot, cocoa beans, melon, pumpkin, mushrooms, sugarcane: all growing around us. There is even a barn where we keep sheep whenever we have the time to tend to them.Even some things that we once did that are no longer here I remember now just by looking. Like that one time we decorated for the new year holidays. Or the time we made eggs and hid them and then tried to do an Easter egg hunt thing. I hid mine high up in a tree, and Therese tried to climb it once she had figured it out, but just kept falling. The memory comes to me now and I can't help laughing."

In the late 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under criticism for both its perceived racist colonial attitude toward the Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting; accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children."

A whale sings to another. But as the sun sets, the 10th little rubber duck is left all alone, bobbing helplessly on the big wide sea.Following the little ducks as they float to all parts of the globe, young explorers can see for themselves the meanings of directional words and learn simple math concepts, such as counting and the use of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Each creature the ducks meet is seen in its own habitat and behaves in a true-to-life manner, offering a very simple first view of biology and geography.Small readers and listeners will empathize with the little duck's plight--and will rejoice at the heartwarming surprise ending. ""A wonderful read-aloud for storytimes or one-on-one sharing. It's a definite 10,"" commented School Library Journal in a starred review. ""Beautifully composed illustrations,"" said Booklist. ""As sublimely simple and endearing as the playthings it portrays,"" agreed Publishers Weekly."
