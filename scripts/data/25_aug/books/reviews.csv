9780723263586,"I brought it for my 8 mth old boy. A month later, he is happily lifting and opening the flaps. I have to read it to him everyday and sing the ""happy birthday"" song after which he will clap his hands.",Jenny Ng

9781406319262,"From about 10 weeks of age, my baby loved this book, although I wasn't that into it myself. Now I love it too. It has scope for voice animation (Little Nutbrown Hare and Big Nut Brown hare) and some opportunity for movement ('as far as I can reach' etc). I think it's a great book, even for the tiniest book lovers.",Linda Coyne
9781406331264,"My one-year-old absolutely loves this book... it's beautifully illustrated, showing babies from all around the world. The predictable rhythm of the book gives it a good pace, and keeps her turning the pages until the end. Highly recommend! It's one of our favs.",Rachel Chappell
9780141381138,"I bought this book for my two year old daughter and she adores the rhyme and rhythm of the words. The illustrations are beautiful and I have caught myself muttering ""pittery pattery, skittery skattery"" to myself on occasion. I have also purchased this book as a gift several times and the recipients have loved it.",Diana Boswarva
9780141381138,"I brought this for my 19 month old son and he can't get enough of it. He loves the rhyming passages and pointing out Zachary Quack on each page. He carries the book around with him and once we read it, he immediately turns back to the first page and says ""Again, again!""",Kim Williams

9780805047905,"This is a brilliant book for young children with large colourful illustrations that catch their attention. The verses, although repetitive in nature, teach colours as well as animal names. Being a board book, the pages are easy for children to turn themselves and tough enough to withstand the odd chew!",Natalie PageWeir
9780805047905,"Lovely rhythming book which my son loves. Being a board book, he finds it easy to turn the pages with me.",Kym Cooper
9780230757370,This is a wonderful book by Julia Donaldson. My 26 month old daughter has speech delay and this is an excellent story for encouraging speech with all of the different sounds being made by the animals. Highly recommended and I would also encourage buyers to get the board book version for little hands.,Diana Boswarva
9781409309062,"My 25 month old daughter is a huge fan of Peppa Pig, but I found 'My Daddy' too sarcastic for a child's book. I am huge fan of this series and books, but this one just missed the mark.",Diana Boswarva

9780723271307,"I bought this book for my 18 month old daughter who is a huge fan of the 'Peppa Pig' television show. It is a nice, sturdy edition and a pleasant Easter story for Peppa fans.",Diana Boswarva
9781409302193,"This is such a cute book! Our child has yet to reach the potty-going age, but we can just imagine her bursting into giggles every time we press the ""Cheer"" button! The colourful illustrations and simple storyline makes it a good motivational tool for kids making the transition from diapers to potty.",Yvonne Lee
9781409302209,This book is fabulous. My son reads it almost every night and regularly talks about Pirate Pete during the day. He seems to relate really well with the story and the pictures - and the cheering helps too :-),Vanessa Di Cicco
9780545340977,I think it was awsome I loved how it shows all the geronimo stilton books,Paul Hayes
9780545253079,My 8 year old is loving this new geronimo stilton series - being a bit longer and hardcovered it is a good progression from the rest of the series. well done geronimo!,MJ
9780141324913,"The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is coming along very nicely. The first one almost made me cry because I was laughing so hard. This one, I'm sure you're delighted to hear, is as good as the first. It follows the same format (looks like a diary, lined pages), but it's missing something......zing. The first one was incredibly funny, but this one just feels like an expansion to the first. It just doesn't feel like it's own book, if you catch my drift. On the bright side it does come with a very nice Loded Diper sticker. I really like this book but it just feels a bit...repetitive.",ReviewerOfReviews
