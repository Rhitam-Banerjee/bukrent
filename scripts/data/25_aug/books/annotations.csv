9781405288828,About Adam Hargreaves,"It all started with a tickle. Roger Hargreaves' son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like. In response, Roger drew a small orange man with extraordinarily long arms that could reach anywhere and tickle anyone. The idea that a tickle could be a character in its own right sparked an idea in Roger's mind. Roger was a successful copywriter but he wanted to do something that would enable him to work from home and spend more time with his four children. He wondered if he could make a living writing and illustrating children's books so he wrote the first Mr Men titles: Mr Tickle, Mr Greedy, Mr Happy, Mr Nosey, Mr Sneeze and Mr Bump. The books were an instant hit and Roger went on to create many more Mr Men and Little Miss characters. What Roger really wanted was to make children laugh. Mr Silly was his favourite Mr Men story and, according to his family, encapsulates his humour most closely. Sadly Roger passed away in 1988, but his son Adam took over the series, introducing new characters and exciting new adventures. Roger once said, 'I feel very happy to think that when the Mr Men and Little Misses are 100 years old, their readers will always be five.' show more"

Herb, in his crazy nighmare, falls unwittingly into his own book - climbing up words of dramatically changing typography and being chased through pages by well-known characters. Herbs earlier snipping-out of Prince Charming and ... adding moustaches and telephones exacerbates the chaos. - The Bookseller 4 A wonderfully imaginative, postmodern idea. Absorbing and with fantastical zany pictures. - The Observer Review 5 Hugely creative, Lauren Child's individual style is shown to perfection in this funny, subversive story. - Parentwise Boldly conceived and executed on all fronts - writing, drawng, design and topography - brilliantly funny and discerning. -- Carousel 'A compelling, quirky and highly original story with vibrant illustrations full of irony and humour...An optimistic book about the kind hearts that lurk beneath even the most irritating exteriors.' -- guardian 20050901 'Lauren Child is the illustrator of the moment .

9780857633484,About Nosy Crow,"Sebastien Braun (Illustrator) Sebastien Braun was born in Strasbourg, the hometown of Gustav Dore and Tomi Ungerer (his heroes). As a child he spent countless hours drawing, but at secondary school there were no art classes, so he filled his homework with doodles and portraits of his teachers. At university he initially studied history - fortunately, the building was shared with the art department, and when he saw the students sketching, knew he had to change. After that, he spent a few years teaching applied art to sixth formers, before taking the plunge as a freelance illustrator. His first commissions were for magazines in Paris, and when he moved to London, he developed his portfolio for children's books. Apart from creating pictures, Seb's favourite pastimes are making toys from wood, playing with his children and climbing the Cotswold hills on his vintage road bike. show more"

Imported from Italy, this snazzy series debut about a globetrotting mouse journalist spreads the cheesy puns nice and thick. On an average day, Geronimo Stilton edits The Rodent's Gazette, the newspaper of New Mouse City, capital of Mouse Island. But at the coaxing of his sister, Thea, and various relatives, Stilton sates his yen for adventure-and adventure writing-by embarking on various excursions and recording and illustrating his exploits in a diary that serves as source material for his books. Stilton, Thea, cousin Trap and nephew Benjamin board a ship in search of buried treasure on a secret deserted island. The trip is filled with peril and plenty of humor, though the treasure isn't what anyone expected. The book's lightning pace and its numerous chapters, as well as a full-color design that displays key words in color type and fun fonts, will hook kids in a flash. And those with a taste for Stilton's breezy style will surely want to devour future whisker-licking-good stories, as the author calls them. The first four book in the Geronimo Stilton series will be released simultaneously, followed by one book per month thereafter. Ages 7-10. (Feb.) Copyright 2004 Reed Business Information. show more"

9781407124414,About Liz Pichon,"Liz Pichon war schon als Kind besonders gut darin, Walt Disney-Figuren zu zeichnen und zu topfern. Laut ihrer Mutter war sie besonders gut darin, eine riesige Sauerei zu veranstalten (das ist auch heute noch so). Liz hielt an ihrer Leidenschaft fest und schloss erfolgreich ihr Grafikdesignstudium ab. Bei Jive Records hatte sie ihren ersten (und einzigen) RICHTIGEN Job. Dort entwarf sie Cover fur Musikalben verschiedenster Bands und Kunstler, von denen wahrscheinlich noch nie jemand etwas gehort hat (obwohl, von einigen wohl doch). Heute arbeitet Liz Pichon als Illustratorin und Autorin und ihre Bilderbucher wurden bereits vielfach ausgezeichnet. Sie lebt mit ihrem Mann und ihren drei Kindern in Brighton. show more"

9780439049962,About Dav Pilkey,"When Dav Pilkey was a kid, he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. Dav was so disruptive in class that his teachers made him sit out in the hallway every day. Luckily, Dav loved to draw and make up stories. He spent his time in the hallway creating his own original comic books--the very first adventures of Dog Man and Captain Underpants. In college, Dav met a teacher who encouraged him to illustrate and write. He won a national competition in 1986 and the prize was the publication of his first book, World War Won. He made many other books before being awarded the 1998 California Young Reader Medal for Dog Breath, which was published in 1994, and in 1997 he won the Caldecott Honor for The Paperboy. The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby, published in 2002, was the first complete graphic novel spin-off from the Captain Underpants series and appeared at #6 on the USA Today bestseller list for all books, both adult and children's, and was also a New York Times bestseller. It was followed by The Adventures of Ook and Gluk: Kung Fu Cavemen from the Future and Super Diaper Baby 2: The Invasion of the Potty Snatchers, both USA Today bestsellers. The unconventional style of these graphic novels is intended to encourage uninhibited creativity in kids. His stories are semi-autobiographical and explore universal themes that celebrate friendship, tolerance, and the triumph of the good-hearted.
