And now that her worst never-imagined worry has happened - her utterly best friend is moving away forever - Clarice doesn't even care about her tickets to the Ruby Redfort, girl detective, film premiere. That is, unless something happens to change things again . . .

Encounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders, conversations with the dragon, Smaug, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of Five Armies are just some of the adventures that befall Bilbo. Bilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of children's fiction.

Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, joined with the Riders of Rohan against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured by orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered the Ents. Gandalf returned, miraculously, and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman.

After a battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for dead; but Frodo is still alive - in the hands of the orcs. And all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing. This classic hardback features Tolkien's original unused dust-jacket design, and its text has been fully restored with almost 400 corrections - with the full co-operation of Christopher Tolkien - making it the definitive version, and as close as possible to the version that J.R.R.

When a boy discovers a single-propeller airplane in his closet, he does what any young adventurer would do: He flies it into outer space! Millions of miles from Earth, the plane begins to sputter and quake, its fuel tank on empty. The boy executes a daring landing on the moon . . . but there's no telling what kind of slimy, slithering, tentacled, fangtoothed monsters lurk in the darkness! (Plus, it's dark and lonely out there.) Coincidentally, engine trouble has stranded a young Martian on the other side of the moon, and he's just as frightened and alone. Martian, Earthling--it's all the same when you're in need of a friend.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"0","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"1","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Oliver Jeffers","series_id":"433616","age_group_1":"0","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"1","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Oliver Jeffers takes a dive into Oliver's own origin story, inspirations, art evolution, and passion for storytelling: from growing up loving art and creating stories as a young boy in Belfast, Ireland; to finding a huge audience for his loveable stories; to what led him to his enormously clever found painting; to his collaborations with U2, TED, Colette, and Apple, to his newest meditative dipped painting art events. Oliver Jeffers is a fresh canvas for his imagination, and includes a pass through his most popular work, never-before-published illustrations and art, and a look into his more personal world of sketchbooks and doodles. Oliver's own story, infused with the whimsy and joy his work is famous for, is must-have not only for current fans of Oliver Jeffers's picture books, but also new fans, art lovers, and bibliophiles both young and old.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"0","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"1","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Oliver Jeffers","series_id":"433616","age_group_1":"0","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"1","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

This book is lots of fun and full of surprises - and the perfect early learning tool for children learning to count. This new, bigger, edition, really brings this classic Spot story to life. Eric Hill was born in North London in 1927 and, apart from a brief period of evacuation, lived there for many years. His career as an artist began when he was employed as a messenger in an art studio and was encouraged to draw. Eric's son was born in 1976 and he began to write stories about a puppy to read to him at bedtime, and so Spot was born.

A delightfully topsy-turvy book with an uplifting message about following your dreams - another blockbusting classic from David Walliams and Tony Ross! There are lots of funny pictures of penguins in this book, but please note any mention of 'free' penguins on the back cover is a joke and as such should be taken lightly.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"0","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"1","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"David Walliams","series_id":"-1","age_group_1":"0","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"1","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Ducks overboard! shouts the captain, as a giant wave washes a box of 10 little rubber ducks off his cargo ship and into the sea. The ducks are swept away in various directions. One drifts west, where a friendly dolphin jumps over it. A whale sings to another. But as the sun sets, the 10th little rubber duck is left all alone, bobbing helplessly on the big wide sea. Small readers and listeners will empathize with the little duck's plight--and will rejoice at the heartwarming surprise ending. In this poignant and funny story, illustrated with strikingly designed collages, Eric Carle takes readers on an exciting voyage of discovery. Following the little ducks as they float to all parts of the globe, young explorers can see for themselves the meanings of directional words and learn simple math concepts, such as counting and the use of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Each creature the ducks meet is seen in its own habitat and behaves in a true-to-life manner, offering a very simple first view of biology and geography. A wonderful read-aloud for storytimes or one-on-one sharing. It's a definite 10, commented School Library Journal in a starred review. Beautifully composed illustrations, said Booklist. As sublimely simple and endearing as the playthings it portrays, agreed Publishers Weekly. This board book edition with sturdy pages is perfect to share with toddlers. Note that this edition does not include a squeaker at the end.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Eric Carle","series_id":"46679","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Monica wants the moon to play with, so her Papa sets out to get it for her. It isn't easy to climb all the way up to the moon, but he finally succeeds -- only to find that the moon is too big to carry home! The way in which this problem is solved is a joyful surprise. Here is a multi-faceted story that appeals to children visually, verbally and emotionally, and which also contains a first lesson in natural history, depicting the eternal cycle of the waxing and waning of the moon. The simple text, just right for reading aloud or for the beginning reader expresses perfectly the purity of a father's love for his child. Small readers will empathize with Monica's longing for the moon, and will be reassured by her father's willingness to try to make her wish come true. And, on a deeper level, they will recognize that Papa is not merely fulfilling Monica's whim, but is demonstrating to her that even a seemingly unreachable goal can actually be attained. 'Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me' is a book to be re-read many times, and to be treasured for its beauty and its positive message of love and inspiration.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Eric Carle","series_id":"46679","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

In this mini-book edition, using strikingly designed, colorful collage illustrations and a beguiling simple text, Eric Carle takes his young readers on a trip with the rooster and his companions. As he travels, the rooster is joined by two cats, three frogs, four turtles, and five fish, offering the child a graphic introduction to the meaning of numbers, number sets, and addition within the context of an entertaining story. When night falls, the rooster's friends find he has made no provisions for their food or shelter and, disappointed, they abandon the expedition--once again in sets of five, four, three, and two, but this time in a declining series. Finally the rooster, too, decides that he has seen enough of the world and that he is, in fact, a little bit homesick. Eric Carle believes in letting children make learning discoveries at their own pace. This book can be read and enjoyed for its story and its beautiful illustrations alone; however, the child who is ready to begin to think mathematically will find additional pleasures in the opportunities presented in the text, the pictures and the diagrams for learning basic arithmetic concepts.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Eric Carle","series_id":"46679","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Judith Kerr was one of the best-loved authors and illustrators to ever put pencil to paper. The books she created, including The Tiger Who Came to Tea, Mog the Forgetful Cat, When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit and many many more, have become classics of children's literature, loved by generations of readers. But what of the life behind the iconic characters? Judith's own story is riveting, from her early childhood in Berlin, dramatically cut short by the family having to flee the rising Nazi Party, to her time at the BBC in the 1950s and her long and happy marriage to the celebrated screenwriter Nigel Kneale, creator of British television's first major hit, The Quatermass Experiment. The joy of this very special book is in hearing this story from Judith herself, accompanied by a treasure trove of illustrations and memorabilia. All combine to give an unforgettable insight into the creative process behind these beloved stories. This book was published in 2013, but Judith continued to work up until her death in 2019. While she may have gone, her creatures live on. They are much-loved characters who spring to life from the pages of her books, but they are also those who have played a part in her inspirational life. They are to be found here, in a book to cherish and return to again and again. In 2023 we celebrate 100 years since Judith's birth and in this updated edition, her final working years have been wonderfully evoked in a new chapter written by Judith's son, the author, Matthew Kneale.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"0","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"1","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Judith Kerr","series_id":"1167220","age_group_1":"0","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"1","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Katerina was the only goose on her pond, and this made her very sad and rather lonely. Sometimes she thought she could see another goose in the side of the bank manager, Mr Buswell's shiny car. She would stare and stare at it, hoping that one day that goose would come out and join her on the pond. \"Just look at that silly bird!\" said Mr Buswell. But everyone liked Katerina no matter what he said. One dark Christmas night when everyone was at a party in the square, Katerina woke alone. She went to see the goose in the shiny car, but the goose had gone - had he come out at last? And who was that man with the goose-sized bag coming out of the bank?

With bright, bold artwork, simple, catchy text and a whole host of favourite farm animals, Oh Dear! is a classic story to come back to again and again, and the thick board pages, chunky cased cover and sturdy flaps make it great for small hands. Rod Campbell, the creator of the preschool lift-the-flap classic Dear Zoo, has been a trusted name in early learning for over thirty-five years, and Oh Dear! has been a firm favourite with toddlers and parents alike since it was first published in 1983. Little animal lovers will also enjoy Rod Campbell's Look After Us, a lift-the-flap animal book for toddlers with a positive message about conservation.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"1","bestseller_age1":"1","bestseller_age2":"1","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"1","borrowed_age1":"1","borrowed_age2":"1","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Rod Cambell","series_id":"500564","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

Racing Post Being a stable lass is probably one of the hardest jobs in the country, and yet for Gemma Hogg it is the most rewarding. She works in the beautiful Yorkshire market town of Middleham and if her colleagues are occasionally challenging, then the horses are downright astonishing. Now, in Stable Lass, she takes us into the closed world of a top racing yard, from the elation of having several winners in one day to the almost indescribable grief of losing a horse. Like most stable lads and lasses, Gemma arrived in her yard as a teenager fresh out of racing college and had to cope with living away from home for the first time, as well as adapting to the brutal long hours, backbreaking work and often treacherous weather. She describes falling in love with Polo Venture, the first racehorse in her care, the pure exhilaration of riding him on Middleham Gallops for the first time and what happens when a horse takes against you, from the growling gelding Valiant Warrior to the potentially lethal Broadway Boy. She brings to life the characters around the yard, from straight-talking boss Micky Hammond to the jockeys starving themselves to make weight, the wealthy owners and the other stable lads and lasses who come from a range of different places and backgrounds. Stable Lass by Gemma Hogg is a unique look into the world of horse racing filled with heart-warming stories and amazing thoroughbreds - some loveable, some cantankerous, all impressive.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Push Pull My First Touch and Find","series_id":"757816","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

I am so jealous of David Whitehouse's writing.' Adam Kay Memories make us who we are - but what if yours belonged to someone else? David Whitehouse's The Long Forgotten is the story of a missing plane, a rare-flower hunter, and a lonely young man who has begun to remember a past that isn't his. It's the story of a long-buried mystery, a quest that ended in tragedy, and a love that can never be forgotten. 'Powerful, eccentric . . . Whitehouse's writing is energetic and pacey, spiked with startling moments of tenderness and superbly controlled' The Times","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Push Pull My First Touch and Find","series_id":"757816","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.' Long Walk to Freedom In 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first president of democratic South Africa. Five years later, he stood down. In that time, he and his government wrought the most extraordinary transformation, turning a nation riven by centuries of colonialism and apartheid into a fully functioning democracy in which all South Africa's citizens, black and white, were equal before the law. Dare Not Linger is the story of Mandela's presidential years, drawing heavily on the memoir he began to write as he prepared to finish his term of office, but was unable to finish. Now, the acclaimed South African writer Mandla Langa has completed the task using Mandela's unfinished draft, detailed notes that Mandela made as events were unfolding and a wealth of previously unseen archival material. With a prologue by Mandela's widow, Graca Machel, the result is a vivid and inspirational account of Mandela's presidency, a country in flux and the creation of a new democracy. It tells the extraordinary story of the transition from decades of apartheid rule and the challenges Mandela overcame to make a reality of his cherished vision for a liberated South Africa.","stock_available":"1","amazon_bestseller":"0","bestseller_age1":"0","bestseller_age2":"0","bestseller_age3":"0","bestseller_age4":"0","bestseller_age5":"0","bestseller_age6":"0","most_borrowed":"0","borrowed_age1":"0","borrowed_age2":"0","borrowed_age3":"0","borrowed_age4":"0","borrowed_age5":"0","borrowed_age6":"0","suggestion_age1":"1","suggestion_age2":"1","suggestion_age3":"0","suggestion_age4":"0","suggestion_age5":"0","suggestion_age6":"0","tag1":"Push Pull My First Touch and Find","series_id":"757816","age_group_1":"1","age_group_2":"1","age_group_3":"0","age_group_4":"0","age_group_5":"0","age_group_6":"0"},

You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution... Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky. In The Bad Beginning, the siblings encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune and cold porridge for breakfast.
